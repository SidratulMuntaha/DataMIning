gqp7ra,SuggestALaptop,I’d just like mention that 740 has abysmal battery life. For that reason alone I’d go M15. I agree G14 that one’s great. Other suggestions would be Razer Blade 15 Eluktronics MAG 15 Aero 17 or 15. Actually now I look at your situation Aero 15 or 17.

gqv259,SuggestALaptop,Lenovo slim has best processor of all of those laptops 4700U being an 8 core chip and all other ones being literally half at 4 cores. I think Lenovo slim is best laptop but 8GB is ok but not great. find this same laptop 16GB or add an additional 8GB when receive laptop I would absolutely do Lenovo Slim 7 Keep looking for laptops Ryzen 4000 series chips those are best in market right now and cheaper than Intel counterparts.,0.05,0.793,0.156,0.8541,1
gqw84n,SuggestALaptop,seems it does get warm because vents are blocked for some stupid reason.

gqq8md,SuggestALaptop,Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. This is 13 I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. has brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared Intel. also has a very capable little GPU that game at 1080p medium in most titles play games.

gqpfnh,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of following lid is made from brushed metal it be opened easily one hand and case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. display part flexes easily and keyboard bends a little are hard typer. is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means 't connect external monitors using port. ram is not upgradeable so what buy is what get major con 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning would use Fn keys use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not best option are used mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it charge up 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 9.5 hours.

gqqt94,SuggestALaptop,I would prefer Zephyrus G15 it’s AMD Zyron which Strix is Intel.

For higher end then I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You get additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . smaller battery give 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect double get bigger battery life . This version has bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it be hard open it one hand Screen is Full HD IPS 144Hz refresh rate comes 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what . Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and dedicated buttons Audio is also average. Comes HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port. Very good heat mangement in general but it is better for GPU than it is for CPU. Make sure check out This Laptop Buying Guide post for best laptops ,0.012,0.815,0.173,0.9943,1

gqne7p,SuggestALaptop,Since asked about photo editing and video editing ignore advice get a gaming laptop. Those are NOT designed for photo editing. You a laptop decent thermals for sure but mostly a high-resolution color-accurate display that supports 100% Adobe SRGB and DP3 color space. Most gaming laptops are 1080p or 1440p at best and are not designed for color accuracy at all. They are designed for very fast refresh rates which are useless for photo and video editing. Apple MacBook Pro line HP Z line HP Spectre x360 OLED screen and higher-end Dell XPS are all examples of laptops a suitable screen for what are trying do. MacBook Pro 13 is probably only one available for under 1400 although Spectre x360 OLED be found under 1400 on sale. MacBook Pro also has T2 chip which dramatically accelerates video encoding and takes load off MacBook’s CPU. One alternative suggestion? iPad Pro 12.9 and Apple Magic Keyboard and Pencil. This is a very good photo editing machine that run Photoshop Procreate Adobe Fresco iMovie and others. iPad has an incredible high resolution bright LCD which suppports DP3 color gamut. Apple pencil is hands down best drawing and stylus input available. And Magic Keyboard makes iPad a real candidate for laptop replacement.,0.024,0.865,0.11,0.969,1

This is probably only small laptop powerful specs that's worth money right now. I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped.

gqmj7s,SuggestALaptop,For lower end of your budget I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of following lid is made from brushed metal it be opened easily one hand and case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. display part flexes easily and keyboard bends a little are hard typer. is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means 't connect external monitors using port. ram is not upgradeable so what buy is what get major con 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning would use Fn keys use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not best option are used mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it charge up 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 9.5 hours.

gqpst6,SuggestALaptop,Depends on how badly a laptop right now. There is always a better faster CPU around corner....

gqihti,SuggestALaptop,Man that's a tough one. really comes down what is most important gaming or productivity? i7 obviously run much better programs like fusion due it's faster speed and more cores but i5 laptop pump out more consistent and higher FPS on games play. For example both GPUs definitely pump out 100 FPS on average for CS GO on low settings but 1650 do it at higher settings as well. 1650 also has better lows which means won't get as much frame dip jutter. Games like CS GO don't a powerful CPU get most frames since it's an old game but obviously a decent GPU is needed for high FPS. Now for GTA 5 definitely 1650. 1050 play it but 'll likely have have settings at somewhere between low/medium get a 60FPS average while 1650 could probably do it at a mix of medium/high.,0.057,0.767,0.176,0.9595,1

gqir5k,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of following lid is made from brushed metal it be opened easily one hand and case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. display part flexes easily and keyboard bends a little are hard typer. is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means 't connect external monitors using port. ram is not upgradeable so what buy is what get major con 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning would use Fn keys use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not best option are used mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it charge up 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 9.5 hours.

gqias8,SuggestALaptop,I would stay far away from 2017 MacBook Air. That is just way outdated spec-wise for price. 700 Surface Pro 7 at Best Buy is one i3 and 4GB of ram yes? so stay away. i3 is a fairly slow CPU but its 4GB of ram that just isn’t enough in 2020. For 100 more get i5/8/128 but 128 is going get tight really fast. You should really look for these minimum specs in 2020 4 core CPUn 10th gen Intel or AMD Ryzen 4000 8GB of ram 256 GB SSD storage 1080p or higher screen For 999 student discount get 2020 MacBook Air i5 10th gen 8/256 which is a much better laptop and handle needs outlined. Unless a Mac though may consider a Windows 10 PC which get mostly better hardware at price point.

gqgae2,SuggestALaptop,wait then I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You get additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . smaller battery give 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect double get bigger battery life . This version has bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it be hard open it one hand Screen is Full HD IPS 144Hz refresh rate comes 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what . Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and dedicated buttons Audio is also average. Comes HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

A used/refurb unit be in your price range and should have plenty of life left. 2 Install an SSD it doesn't come one. 8GB RAM truly leave lots of tabs open. Upgrading thinkpads is usually easy so don't be afraid DIY. You also repaste CPU/GPU high-quality thermal compound for better thermal performance. 3 Install Linux. No seriously. 're just streaming Linux tends use less RAM in background and doesn't usually slow down time like Windows installs . Linux Mint MATE or Linux Mint XFCE use under 1GB. Bonus Linux is free and works well on Thinkpads. 4 My Thinkpad an HD4000 iGPU handle 1080p YouTube video fine and while could get something more powerful won't necessarily .

People on best-buy have reviews for this laptop and they seem be experiencing fan issues. Apparently fan is very loud. HP Envy series have a very poor battery life although I ’t confirmed on this one yet. Before someone says upgrade screen and connectivity OP is from UK and there is no option for an upgrade.

gqaje8,SuggestALaptop,With HP Envy sure pick a good display. I think base display has only 250 Nits of brightness... I think there is an option for a FHD 400 nits. That one be better one or 4K don't care about battery life .,0.105,0.714,0.181,0.5223,1

gqaje8,SuggestALaptop,Have both of those exact models but 13 4700U 16GB. Dell 9370 I have is 4K touchscreen. HP Envy actually fits in same footprint at Dell but is thicker. feels very slightly heavier but is nice use. keys are wider and have good travel and trackpad is good. I particularly like hardware camera button and finger print sensor. runs slick and responsive and sound/speakers are miles better. As mentioned above biggest caveat is screen which is dimmer. screen is also FHD on envy Vs 4K but this doesn't as significant a different as brightness. You crank up brightness but I'd say equivalent brightness at 50% on Dell is about 70% on Envy. Haven't tested batter yet but it is really nice use so far.,0.064,0.7,0.236,0.9822,1

I have real doubts in ‘build quality’ of ASUS gaming laptops. I know 9750H CPU runs hot but on both of my laptops they were around 95-100 deg C under load and 60-70 idle. Undervolting by any amount made it more unstable than it already was. Could have done a bit more eg re-paste but spending 2k on a laptop it wasn’t a good experience.

gqdvup,SuggestALaptop,Hi are purchasing in U.S?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gqdvup,SuggestALaptop,Copying from another comment I just made for under 500 got 2 great options either this off brand from walmart or This Lenovo Ideapad both offer very similar specs but personally I like one from Walmart more because according reviews build quality is much better and it is also very light at 2.55 lbs iirc.,0.0,0.835,0.165,0.8641,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,’t run full version of Microsoft Office application like Word Excel PowerPoint. That’s a major disadvantage I think of. your sole purpose is note taking I would agree iPad and Apple stylus are very superior and their screens are very good too.,0.055,0.65,0.295,0.9039,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,I work for a fortune 500 company and alot of my executives wanted get tablets as real computer replacements. They came back crawling after 1 week traditional laptops. iPad is nice and is being used alot more but despite what Apple marketing tells it is not a substitute for a really full fledged Mac or PC. Especially when are paying same price or more than could just buy a high end windows or low end Mac. With tablets are at mercy of apple for apps Your whole class uses a program not available on apple store? You're screwed. I just don't see limit yourself for same price especially when iPad it's keyboard is now heavier and thicker than a regular laptop.,0.058,0.899,0.043,-0.4215,-1

gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,No. had a desktop or a laptop iPad would great secondary device but as only device I wouldn't recommend it. I agree that touchscreen pen support are pretty good for note taking. That's why i personally got a windows laptop which was capable of doing that. I don't know which courses would have in your college but in my masters we had a couple of subjects which involved coding and there is absolutely no way of doing that on iPad.,0.112,0.694,0.194,0.8584,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,I have been thinking of using that setup while travelling but I feel it is a little expensive it cost almost as good as this ASUS Zenbook which costs almost as much.,0.0,0.891,0.109,0.5319,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,Before Magic Keyboard I would have said “absolutely no way.” But Magic Keyboard is transformative. I’m using one now on 2018 iPad Pro write this post. Incredible. Even so I’m going say “maybe.” You didn’t list what your course of study is so that have an impact on answer your question. But generally ’ll be sure that 1. There are no applications that are either not available on iPad or very limited on iPad. For example yes Excel is available on iPad but it is not capable of opening more complex spreadsheets every iPadOS version gets closer but it won’t match desktop versions for years ever . Photoshop on iPad is also not as capable as desktop version. Etc. etc. 2. You live iPad multitasking which is really just 2-app-tasking some app switching. This is also improving but iPad just doesn’t do more than a couple of tasks at once very well at all. You could get frustrated are trying participate in a Zoom lecture take notes and do research at same time. 3. You don’t an external monitor. Many college students get a cheap external LCD monitor for their apartment or dorm come home and write papers and do research on while using a large screen. Almost any LCD tv also act as an external monitor and do double duty that way. IPad only mirror its screen not extend its screen so ’ll just end up looking at a copy of what’s on your iPad screen. Again this could change future iPadOS releases but now it is an issue. Now as Good 1. Magic keyboard and trackpad is a game changer. might actually be worth price 2. With Apple Pencil iPad becomes an excellent maybe best digital note taker 3. Pull iPad off keyboard and have an excellent tablet for reading eBooks watching videos playing games etc. 4. iPadOS files app now gives iPad a legitimate file manager which works well local files and cloud storage 5. Apple has done an excellent job of supporting iPads over time so should expect a new 2020 iPad get 5 years of OS updates 6. LIDAR scanner in new iPad Pros could be put some really cool uses in future 7. IPad be a delight carry around class and back given its size and weight 8. IPad has plenty of CPU power so won’t be lacking in that area. is actually faster than MacBook Air. 9. IPad applications are becoming more and more capable all time and so in future should expect more and more equivalency desktop versions I could afford an iPad Pro 12.9 Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard or MacBook Air 16/512 that would be a tough choice. Worst case get iPad setup and see it works. it doesn’t get yourself a cheap PC laptop for 500 later and use it for whatever iPad won’t do.,0.052,0.838,0.11,0.9877,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,Yes. You should absolutely do this. iPad Pro is essentially made for productivity. iOS store has so many cool note-taking apps too. Google Paperlike - it's a screen protector that feels like paper when write on it Apple Pencil. like take written notes this is a game changer. like draw it's a game changer. 2020 iPad pro is extremely powerful - newest chip is an 8 core processor - I have seen people editing 4k video scrubbing and on it. I am not an giant Apple fan I only have an iPhone and Airpods but really think pro is a perfect device for a college kid and post-college. Magic keyboard is also clutch.,0.0,0.841,0.159,0.9279,1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,I honestly believe that surface pro 7 is very overpriced especially start buying accessories. money is no problem for go for it!,0.206,0.675,0.119,-0.2942,-1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,I recommend Lenovo Yoga C740 14 inch. You’ll get so much more for your money. stylus that come it may be inferior one Microsoft pro 7 but ’ll be spending 100 buck on stylus anyway so always buy a better one for your Yoga.,0.04,0.829,0.131,0.6304,1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,I think Surface Pro 7 is an excellent choice. There are decent sales and Costco usually offers SP7 keyboard and pen for 1000. Put an Urban Armor Gear case on that thing and ’ll have a backpack-friendly tough little tablet and laptop. biggest challenge may be kickstand design takes up a lot of table space and may not work well on small writing desk in lecture halls. For taking notes though Surface Pro is great. other alternative is 2-in-1 style laptop like HP Envy or HP Spectre x360. 2-in-1s are better laptops and worse tablets than Surface. I find for note taking pen thickness of 2-in-1s is less than ideal and I personally don’t like weight of them as a tablet nor do I like feeling keyboard and trackpad on bottom when screen is folded over. On Surface just pull off type cover and ’ll have a more normal tablet. Cool trick on surface pull off type cover and reattach backwards so that it becomes back of surface. I saw that in a video and though “why don’t they that more obvious?” Genius. You likely get a bit more hardware for your money get something like HP Envy but really a tablet that replace your laptop one that be made durable for kicking around in a backpack and is great for note-taking then SP7 is an excellent choice.,0.043,0.831,0.126,0.9659,1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,I would buy an iPad pro have budget. I currently have a Surface Pro 5 highest configuration and it's great - however I think get more out of an iPad. is thin has an amazing display and super portable. 's cheaper than a similar configured surface. My complaints Surface are that alcantara keyboard get torn and scratched carry it in a bag and it rubs against things. I have also had issues screen - something gets stuck between keyboard and screen in your bag somehow it create screen burns quite easily. I really hated this. My girlfriend just bought surface pro 7 decked out and has already developed 2 screen burns as well. biggest game changer is this stuff called Paperlike - its a screen protector that makes your screen feel like youre writing on actual paper. This sounds like it's right up your alley. buy a new 12.9 ipad Pro magic keyboard and apple pencil its about 1500 and I know surface pro 7 is in that same range not a bit more when it's highly configured. Also don't have buy 350 dollar keyboard for iPad - that takes price down considerably.,0.058,0.821,0.121,0.9049,1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure we find a 2-in-1 device that is a good value on a low budget. Lenovo Flex 5 14 is my recommendation. comes a 6-core Ryzen 5 processor 16 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 IPS display. This combination should be just fine for uses listed.

gqfkdv,SuggestALaptop,are going use cam often I would recommend buying a seperate cam for better quality that aside I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You get additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . smaller battery give 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect double get bigger battery life . This version has bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it be hard open it one hand Screen is Full HD IPS 144Hz refresh rate comes 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness.

gqex0q,SuggestALaptop,Hi are purchasing in U.S?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gqex0q,SuggestALaptop,I would look into AMD Ryzen 4000 series that just launched. They are more powerful and cheaper than any Intel counterpart. For your budget I recommend Dell G5 SE has a 3Ghz 6 core/12 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 4600H 8GB of RAM 2X4GB upgradable AMD Radeon RX 5600M basically a 2060. 256GB SSD 15.6 1080p screen 860 ,0.0,0.871,0.129,0.7264,1
gqegkp,SuggestALaptop,I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. G14 it's literally smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-12 hour battery life. also doesn't look all gamery so it be used in a public spaces. comes an 3Ghz 8 Core/16 Thread AMD Ryzen 4800HS 16GB RAM expandable 40GB 512GB SSD expandable GTX 1660Ti 1080p display 120hz 1450 Here are some reviews help ,0.0,0.934,0.066,0.6705,1
gqe6y5,SuggestALaptop,mx250 is an entry level dedicated GPU card so I wouldn’t have my hopes very high.,0.0,0.691,0.309,0.7003,1
gqe6y5,SuggestALaptop,I had a Zenbook before and did not like it - screen felt like it had a green hue it and it didn't feel as optimized for Windows as other competitors. This was a while ago so I'm sure that's changed a bit but just giving a forewarning. 're in that range I'd suggest new XPS 15. new screen is amazing and a 16 10 ratio. processor in Zenbook is a Core i7-10510U and Dell has a 9th Generation Intel Core™ i7-9750H - now might be thinking why do I a 9th gen over a 10th? well look at last letter in each Zenbook is a U vs Dell which is an H. I'm not sure how much know about processors but this is a huge difference. look them both up in CPU benchmark 9th gen out performs 10th by somewhat close double. Not only that GPU in Dell destroys mx250. To answer your question no mx250 is kind of garbage.,0.076,0.808,0.116,0.818,1
gqe6y5,SuggestALaptop,Some users hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 13 X360 ENVY. has brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared Intel. also has a very capable little GPU that game at 1080p medium in most titles play games. 's about same as a mx250-350 dedicated GPU. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and sure get Intel wifi 6 card. 100% sRGB 1080p IPS Panel.

gqe6y5,SuggestALaptop,How about this ASUS Zenbook because of following lid is made from brushed metal it be opened easily one hand and case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. display part flexes easily and keyboard bends a little are hard typer. is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means 't connect external monitors using port. ram is not upgradeable so what buy is what get major con 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning would use Fn keys use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not best option are used mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it charge up 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 9.5 hours.

That computer only has a screen brightness of 250 nits which is on low end compared a lot of laptops on market. Why not buy and iPad pro or new Dell XPS line? Both have extremely nice displays and specs capable of what 're doing. Gaming laptops might be nice but they are not necessarily great for Digital art. gaming and art then go new XPS.

ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 G401IA is my recommendation work a 14 display. has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside GTX 1660 Ti MQ graphics which handle your uses including some video editing.

gq5fd2,SuggestALaptop,Look at Dell XPS 13 line they have some very powerful and super well built machines. An intel i5 8gb of ram and 512 gb of storage cost u 1250 usd. refurbished ones or last gen models are just as good and wil run for a lower price within your budget. HP envy line also has some great options from 800- 1200 usd. They have intel i5’s or i7’s 8gb of ram and 512 gb of storage. My last recommendation is Surface Laptop. build quality on these machines is amazing and their screens are great as well. storage is lacking however could only fit 256 gb in your budget. There is a price premium for Surface products but get what pay for. Stay away from MacBook Air it’s way too expensive for performance get. Your money is much better spent on a windows machine because she isn’t using any Mac specific apps anyway I hope this helped stay safe and healthy!,0.027,0.782,0.192,0.981,1
gq5fd2,SuggestALaptop,I have been suggesting iPad pro a lot. I think it is your best option. While are subject iPad iOS this is not a huge problem at all. People tend think there is only one way of going about computer software - look at iPad as an alternative that which may be better. Do not go a Macbook Air - new ones are just rehoused older technology sold at a premium price. new iPad has a new 8 core chip and is extremely capable of doing what your sister needs - especially photo editing.,0.021,0.846,0.133,0.8831,1
gq5fd2,SuggestALaptop,I don’t know much about how prices are in Malaysia but in USA for a 1200 budget would have a lot of choices. You said your sister has a 2-in-1 but it doesn’t sound like she uses touch screen or flip-around modes or pen much at all . true I’d suggest stay away from Surface line. Those are really designed for someone who wants a tablet-first experience and ’ll pay a lot for that design which may not be needed. They’re also lousy laptops meaning they are very hard use in your lap. They are brilliant tablets though. Surface Pro 7 - good all around but by time price in Type Cover and Pen ’re spending quite a bit for some fairly low specs . I owned a Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4 and loved them both but I like form factor. Surface Pro X - very intriguing and more modern design but may not be available in Malaysia and has performance and compatibility questions Surface Go 2 - well made small tablet but underpowered especially for price and really would only recommend for someone who values extreme portability Source I owned a Surface Go for a year and loved it but I wanted something very small Another 2-in-1 like HP Envy would be a good choice. But run into same sorts of quality issues have now. Still should get 3 years out of it. MacBook Air. Don’t let people who only measure a computer by its Geekbench score put off. Air is a fine computer for MOST people. has a bright Retina display vs. dim 1080p displays on many value PCs it has completely fine performance one exception it has impeccable build quality it has T2 chip for security and additional performance it has Touch ID and last for many years. also hold its value way better than a comparably priced PC. Where Air is NOT fine is for CPU-intensive tasks that persist like video rendering. is fine for quick cpu spikes like applying a photoshop filter or rendering a quick transition. But it has poor thermal headroom so anything that creates heat buildup result in CPU downclocking stay cool. Most people don’t actually do these kinds of tasks and so never notice. Now iPad Pro is an intriguing choice. I’m writing this post on iPad Pro Magic Keyboard and I tell combination of iPadOS 13.4 and Magic Keyboard is transformative. is absolutely capable of replacing a laptop for many people. question for yoyour sister is whether iPadOS version of Word is featured enough for her work. she is just doing general writing it be fine. she is doing complex layouts tables of contents extensive footnoting then it might not be capable of what she needs. IPad does meet most of your requirements. Bright screen great for movies good speakers light weight long battery life.

gqb739,SuggestALaptop,I would look into something that has new AMD Ryzen 4000 chips that just launched. You get better performance more cores better battery life better gaming better security and cheaper than Intel counterparts. iGPU in these chips are able play many titles at 1080p medium. 's extremely capable for a integrated GPU more or less performance of an entry level discrete graphics card. Don't buy and Intel chip Intel's UHD iGPU. 's basically unusable for gaming.

Even though Surface Pro 7 i3 is at your budget I don’t recommend it as get a LOT more hardware value for 700 are willing consider a 2-in-1 that is larger 13” inches and 4GB of Ram just isn’t enough in 2020.,0.019,0.939,0.042,0.4351,1
gqb739,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of following lid is made from brushed metal it be opened easily one hand and case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. display part flexes easily and keyboard bends a little are hard typer. is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means 't connect external monitors using port. ram is not upgradeable so what buy is what get major con 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning would use Fn keys use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not best option are used mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it charge up 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 9.5 hours.

Here are some benchmarks of games that are playable on 4700U. find these frame acceptable than go for smaller formfactor of x360 it's little capable integrated GPU.

gq0she,SuggestALaptop,Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. has brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared Intel. also has a very capable little GPU that game at 1080p medium in most titles play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it CPU- 2.3Ghz AMD Ryzen 5 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable buy 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY default 250nit screen. Get 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible 1089 for 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not skimp on screen and wifi on any of these configs. Trust me. ,0.062,0.774,0.164,0.9726,1
gq5rrp,SuggestALaptop,Hi I definitely think that ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 is a really solid choice especially considering price tag. Availability is very limited currently but it should become more broadly available soon. is light performs well in games and CAD programs and is reasonably well built.,0.033,0.788,0.178,0.7184,1
gq5npp,SuggestALaptop,Option 2 and add ram later on based on needs. Ram be expanded while video card 't. All laptops come 2 slots of ram look both of slots are filled it's 1x8gb easily add another stick it's 2x 4gb 'll have change both 2x 8gb,0.0,0.946,0.054,0.34,1
gq5npp,SuggestALaptop,depends on laptop. Many laptops cannot have RAM upgraded later. IF laptops are considering do allow for memory upgrades later then go for extra video memory. RAM cannot be upgraded that is a tougher choice and I would personally go for 16GB. video card use system ram in a pinch.,0.0,0.926,0.074,0.3818,1

gq5j3m,SuggestALaptop,Pixelbook Go runs on ChromeOs - a dekstop/mobile os where 't run your normal apps like on windows or macos. You install android apps on it and lately it got support for running linux apps not sure what distro is based on but whole process is overhwelming and i wouldn't consider this Chromebook for your work at all. Even as a Chromebook is very expensive point of chromebooks is be as cheap as possible and have access a browser now android apps but not cost 600 . At that pricepoint have consider laptops true desktop OSes. I'm a senior Cs student and a software dev wanna be. I'm familiar web dev but said that 're just starting out as a web dev. Maybe know by now that not just software development but specifically web development is a very broad aspect has a lot of different technologies etc. Are trying become a backend dev? A front-ent? Backend and DevOps engineer? A full stack dev a.k.a software engineer usually frontend backend devops all together ? For all of these positions don't a laptop a good gpu or dedicated gpu at all well depending on project 're working on over 90% of time won't a good gpu. Unfortunately cannot install any IDEs frameworks etc directly on chromeos have do that through that linux-support alternative which isn't that good on this regard and also not every dev-related app or whatever has linux support. I just wanted first clarify that there is no such thing as mAcOs iS sO mUcH bEtTer fOr sOftWaRe dEvElOpmEnT . That's not true at all. Depending on what do as a software dev windows and gnlinux have advantages over macOs because of support. And vice versa macOs over 2 f.e for ios app development. You dual boot windows or gnlinux macos but there is hardware compatibility issues and won't get full macOs app support also nvidia gpu driver support is officialy non existent since 2014 or something there are fan made driver support but that's not an issue since won't a dedicated gpu for work at all as i mentioned earlier. Also don't trust people who say macOs' terminal is soo much better bcz macos is unix based and run commands on it and bla bla bla guess what? You have equivalent terminal commands on window's cmd/powershell. Now that it has linux support write same terminal commands as would in a gnlinux distro. Also those macOs commands that most talk about those people usually just navigate through directories and brag about terminal lol . I know it sound overhwelming but at least now have necessery info about what 'll really for your work. So mentioned 2000Cad. For that price get a laptop excellent build quality very good screen quality great batterylife and cpu performance for most part while having a small body overall. Since weight is important for a laptop a screen under 15.6 diagonally might be ideal. a 13.3-14 screen i wouldn't recommend standard 16 9 ratio since for smaller screens 16 9 seems very short. More vertical space is highly appreciated for work 're doing but we get narrower display. F.E we compare a 13.3 16 9 screen and a 13.3 16 10 screen macbook pro 13's or xps 13 9300's that 16 10 screen is bigger though diagonally they're same in area that 16 10 is a bit bigger but it is narrower horizontaly but taller vertically. There are also 3 2 screens which are taller but more narrow f.e Surface Laptop 3 either 13 which is 13.5 diagonally or 15 Surface Book 3 13/15 Huawei Matebook X Pro a new Acer 13 that just got released etc although there aren't a lot of 3 2 screen laptops on market. On cpus at least a quadcore cpu is necessery. Intel's 10 gen either comet lake or ice lake are most common for that 2000cad price. An Ice Lake i5 is very similar in performance an Ice Lake i7 search on google for these similarities so getting an i7 is not necessary. On other hand a comet lake i5 i5 10210U is a quadcore cpu and an i7 10710U like on my Prestige 15 in a 6 core/12 thread cpu which works around 80-100% better than that i5 depending on how laptop manufacturers configure those cpus. Just because there is a U at end of cpu instead of an H doesn't mean that U series cpu is weaker than H series. Msi configured that 10710u perform its limits so its performance is same as an i7 9750H that would find in a Macbook Pro 16 i confirm this . Unfortunately that i7 10710u doesn't perform same on smaller laptops like it does in my Prestige 15 because of cooling f.E in a last gen Dell Xps 13 9380 and Lenovo X1 Carbon 7th gen i guess 10710u performs around 20% worse. Anyway there are new Amd ryzen 4th gen mobile cpus that perform better than all intel cpus for a lower price. Also they perform better while pulling less wattage or same depending on cpu . Because work do doesn't cause any issues from cpu amd cpus don't work well android studio it throw a bsod when trying run android studio's emulator that's my experience since i work it . problem is that there aren't any laptops a 16 10 or 3 2 display and a ryzen 4th gen cpu. There is a 13.3 Hp envy a 4th gen ryzen cpu which is overall very great for its price but is has a 16 9 screen which i don't recommend anyone who a 13-14 display. There is a gaming laptop - a 14 16 9 Asus rog g14 ryzen 4th gen that for 2000 cad has best mobile cpu in any laptop at moment and is overall best performing laptop for its category its batterylife is quite long for a gaming laptop but problem is that it is a bit too heavy for maybe it looks like a gaming laptop although overall muted 16 9 screen it has a dgpu which tou won't . What it would highly suggest is either one of these laptops This Dell Xps 13 9300 config should get a matte screen protector for it search amazon or this config which already comes a matte screen but it isn't touchscreen. I know that first config is slightly above your budget but at this pricepoint it is worth considering. This config of 2020 base MacBook Pro 13 a quadcore i5 and 16gb of ram is very good. I wouldn't recommend 8gb of ram anymore 'll end up having opened a couple of apps tabs on browser which use a big protion of your ram. Also endup getting this please consider buying a matte screenprotector Apple advertises their screens as anti reflective and while they have a layer on top they are still glossy and very distractive when 're working in a brightly lit environment. Dell also has an anriglare layer on that first config xps 13 above. Surface Laptop 3 13 is also very nice an i5 10th gen and 16gb ram 're getting a very nice laptop overall. That Hp Envy x360 ryzen 4th gen is also prerty good we have wait for proper reviews see how it performs how's batterylife screen quality etc.,0.054,0.824,0.122,0.9983,1
gq5j3m,SuggestALaptop,Hi I 't give much advice about web development but I definitely say that Pixelbook Go isn't most cost effective option. Instead I'd go Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 1 895.67 CAD configuration comes a 4-core i5 processor 16 GB RAM and a 1080p 14 IPS display which should be fine for general use and web development. weight is only 2.4lbs.

gq2fek,SuggestALaptop,I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper and more secure. For your budget I recommend ASUS A15 This is a 2.9Ghz 8 core 16 thread AMD Ryzen 7 4800H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD GTX 1660Ti or 2060 version 999 ,0.0,0.909,0.091,0.6361,1
gq2fek,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure we find a powerful gaming laptop. I recommend Eluktronics MAX-15 comes a 8-core i7 processor and RTX 2070 graphics which should be plenty powerful for modern games at high ultra settings 1080p.

I'd go Lenovo IdeaPad 3 comes a 4-core Ryzen 5 processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 display. should handle general use tasks just fine on a low budget as well as light games like Sims 4.,0.04,0.785,0.174,0.7184,1
gq1uzj,SuggestALaptop,I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper.

gq1uzj,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we find a powerful gaming laptop. ASUS ROG Zephyrus G15 has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside RTX 2060 MQ graphics which easily handle modern games at high-ultra settings 1080p.

gq1mlt,SuggestALaptop,depends on what prioritize. are carrying laptop everywhere and using it on small desks like those found in lecture hall classrooms may find 15 is just too big. In that case smaller size of 13 be a real delight carry. On other hand mostly use laptop at home probably appreciate extra screen size of 15 and most 15 have a numeric keypad which may also be quite a plus for accounting work.

gpicnk,SuggestALaptop,I've seen ASUS mentioned a lot here. For my two cents while it's not most obnoxious model on their catalog I have GA502 and it's kind of a hot potato. Mothership might be better but after dealing their horrible 'Armoury Crate' software awful cooling system in GA502 and genuinely dismissive and decidedly unhelpful support system company has I wouldn't go ASUS. Their motherboards for desktops are pretty great and their laptops used be incredible but it just doesn't feel that way anymore. Alienware M15 R3 just launched and it has a neat vapor chamber cooling system that supposedly improves thermals by a significant margin. Reviews aren't out yet though so we'll see that hold true. Area 51M is just a beast and absolutely fits 'Onnoxious' criteria though I'm not sure about thermals which should be among most important things look for when select a PC. Outside of Dell's swanky Alienware series MSI has some neat designs and Razer Blade has some slightly subdued aesthetic language but looks and feels just as gamer-y as would hope.

gq0q2o,SuggestALaptop,You are absolutely right about Ryzen 4000 chips. They absolutely demolish 10th Feb Intel chips. envy is laptop I've been recommending over and over because specs and build are so good and cheapish! Some users hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 13 X360 ENVY. has brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared Intel. also has a very capable little GPU that game at 1080p medium in most titles play games.

gq0q2o,SuggestALaptop,AMD Ryzen 4000 is a faster multi-core chip series than Intel 10th gen but both are very speedy. Make sure when do comparison are comparing apples apples. Don't compare a 15-watt Intel U series or 9 watt Intel Y series a 45 watt AMD Hseries chip. Surface Pro 7 is a very good Windows tablet that truly replace a laptop. You asked 1 - how is Microsoft support? Awful. You be running Microsoft Office on Microsoft Windows 10 on a Surface Pro and they'll treat like are running Linux on a Chromebook when call. IF happen live near a Microsoft store though actually get great service in person. 2- Is there a Surface Pro 7 refresh coming? There always a new machine just around corner. 10th gen 17 16GB of RAM be plenty fast and last for quite a few years. Surface now take advantage of Memorial Day sale. wait there always be a bettefaster version coming in future. For that price 1300 might also check out HP Spectre x360 2-in-1. is less of a pure tablet than surface but a whole lot better use as a laptop. HP also has a USB-A port and 2 Thunderbolt ports vs. zero thunderbolt ports on Surface Pro. HP comes a case and pen wherease those cost another 200 for Surface. HP has Windows hello login via face detection AND fingerprint scanning. HP has physical webcam disconnection and keypress disconnect of microphone.,0.017,0.842,0.141,0.9851,1

gppw42,SuggestALaptop,G14 is first of its kind so it's bound have few kinks for being a trailblazer at this size and performance. Has fixes for fan and heat issue. Asus definitely assess this in an update as it's literally just a small setting change. Also update bios latest bios sure are stable. Personally I saw some of reviews and saw some of issues and they seem just be software related aside from keyboard backlight which just sucks. These cons are going be very temporary as this is brand new and users have already fixed issues. hardware is fine and it seems be things updates fix. pros outweigh cons in my opinion and cons are just software related which happens on apple devices that are typically extremely stable so I don't really see it as a con. But it's up ! My friend bought one and it worked fine right our box no issues. So it really is all a gamble but I think it's a pretty safe gamble that's worth it.,0.019,0.832,0.149,0.9577,1

Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You get additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . smaller battery give 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect double get bigger battery life .

Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and dedicated buttons Audio is also average. Comes HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

You lightly game this laptop and use it for casual use. This is not a gamer machine but do most esports titles at 1080p medium.

gpxs49,SuggestALaptop,Intel used be better but was in lead for so long they got lazy and got leapped frogged by AMD who was almost bankrupt and needed innovate its way out of it. They took a gamble on their Ryzen chips in 2016 and 7nm process node last year and they have been killing Intel across desktop workstation server and now finally laptops their Ryzen 4000 series. reason is they are using TSMC'S 7nm process and chiplets design for it's CPU basically they glue chips together higher skus. They are all same just glued cores. Intel is still on 14nm because they design their own chips and saw no push innovation as they were ahead so much. So now they have been at 14nm since 2014. And they still 't just shrink their node because of their monolithic design their chips and issues trying shrink down 10nm. Basically Intel be behind till at least 2023 and by then AMD be on 5nm. Long story short AMD is better option. Cheaper more performance more cores better battery more secure. intel is popular and they are a massive company so it's gonna take time for people really see how ahead AMD is. For video editors majority use AMD now because of high core count CPUs they offer for fairly cheap 3900x is a 12 core CPU for 389 They offer a 64 core monster afford a 4000 chip.

This graphics card handle any games play but might have turn down some settings on more newer demanding games. has 8gb of ram which is not a lot but could always upgrade 16gb. has a 512gb nvme ssd so it holds all of applications documents games photos videos etc. it has a 56whr battery which get decent battery life but do intensive tasks for long periods of time probably carry a charger around go somewhere.

gpr8hz,SuggestALaptop,I tried do this myself and have used Surface Pro and HP Spectre x360. A few things consider 1. You aren't just changing hardware are changing entire ecosystems. Take stock of how many of Apple's ecosystem features are using. I'm not just talking about iMessage although that one alone be a deal-breaker for many people but Keychain Notes News iPhoto iMovie iCloud Drive ApplePay AppleTV etc. You get close reproducing this on Windows but it be more of pain and 'll have lean heavily on Google cloud help . This applies iPadOS apps that might using which may not be available on Windows 10. 2. Decide a tablet that replace your laptop Surface Pro or a laptop that replace your tablet 2-in-1 . 2-in-1s are great laptops that act as a tablet in a pinch but they are 90% Laptop. taking notes on one vs. iPad be a disappointment. Windows 10 is a very good desktop and laptop OS although may be surprised how much time spend tweaking it vs. what are used on Mac that do just about anything . size and thickness them cumbersome tablets and anything above 13 inches is pretty impossible use as a tablet. Surface is much more akin a tablet that replace a laptop. Windows 10 is not a great tablet OS so may miss your iPad. However Surface hardware is very nice as a tablet and generally use a surface like a tablet in a way 't easily use a 2-in-1. surface screen is smaller than virtually all 2-in-1s and using a Surface on a lap is an exercise in futility. You could also consider selling Air and getting Apple Magic Keyboard for your iPad Pro. yes it is expensive but it absolutely makes iPad much more viable as a laptop replacement. x200B For 2-in-1s I generally suggest HP Envy Chewy tell all about this HP Spectre x360 Lenovo Yoga C740 cheaper or Lenovo c940 more expensive For Surface I suggest Surface Pro 7 Costco has a great bundle usually which includes keyboard pen Surface Pro X looks great but are taking a big gamble that ARM processor and why risk adding a bunch of compatibility issues just for thinner bezels?,0.047,0.821,0.132,0.9896,1

gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,I would assume laptops gpus tend produce more heat and more heat leads higher rates of failure. and thats what I think is probably cause of all those Razer laptops defects. Louis Rossmann once invited a repair guy specializing in Razer repairs explain internal designs. IRC cooling system was generally not very good. combined a thin chassis leads a shorter life span I think those that are super thick and heavy such as those Clevo laptops probably last longer comparatively. this is just my guess,0.099,0.857,0.045,-0.5751,-1
gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,As any product . More parts means more failure points. I'm not surprised about toughbook. They are over engineered focus on being durable. So it would be fair assume they would outlive most other models. But I'd assume as a whole integrated systems are more prone failure for simple fact that most of low end market and budget models are made as cheap as possible. I'd think it be more interesting compair pricepoint failure rate. On a purely anecdotal note I've bought and owned many laptops over years many brands Dell budget tier are ones I've had most trouble . So much so I've tended avoid them for last 8 or so years so no idea how they are now. Also my longest lasting laptop was a core 2 based Sony Vaio I think person that inherited it still used it up until last year. So almost 11 years .,0.147,0.82,0.033,-0.953,-1
gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,Only hardware makers know actual failure rates and then they would an identical model where primary difference is GPU/no-GPU. But anecdotally according ever-accurate Internet chat rooms laptops dedicated graphics cards DO fail quite a bit more. is very plausible for 3 related reasons 1. More heat overall as another heat-generating component is squashed into a small area 2. Users who buy these laptops tend use them for more intensive sustained tasks leading .... more heat 3. GPU makers overestimated their components abilities deal heat NVIDIA was famous for a run of GPUs failing Thin laptops and hot components are in conflict. Having ample airflow and big fans is not what most laptop buyers - they thin and quiet. Microsoft Surface Book is rare exception CPU in tablet lid and GPU in base which enabled both components heat up independently and indeed it punches above its weight on sustained tasks vs most ultrabook-type devices as it isolate each heat producing element in a different part of device. I would guess big clunky gaming laptops would do better since they are designed handle heat HOWEVER gaming laptops fall into trap 2 above and run heat-producing games for long periods of time under pretty heavy loads. Even more of a challenge is that CPU and GPU in most laptops are quite close together often sharing same heat pipe meaning heat from one actually be quickly passed other.,0.067,0.869,0.063,-0.2551,-1
gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,I’m curious hear what people say. lurk,0.198,0.549,0.253,0.128,1
gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,I dont think its a video card thing more than product family. gaming lines are always better build quality than budget or mainstream lines. Normally a laptop a separate GPU is better because it has better battery motherboard power supply case hinges monitor panels and those are biggest points of failure. IE HP Omen fail less than Envy which fail less than a Pavillion which fail less than HP no name family fairest comparison I is budget garbage Acer Aspire 5 family. You get same specs a non-gaming/light gaming gpu like MX250 or same exact specs without gpu for 75-100 less. I've gotten 3 gpus. all 3 got fried mother boards in under 2 years. Meanwhile only a quarter of non-gpu aspires have had major issues usually failed fan screen or power adaptor only gpu version have had complete mobo power failures. but thats aspire 200- 600 slapdash disposable laptops.

gppdxd,SuggestALaptop,Can confirm that ENVY x360 15 Ryzen 7 4700U is a beast. I work professionally Blender light gaming on side down time. Blender runs quite well handling over 9 million polys quite easily. RAM SSD and Wifi are all upgradable. Though be honest RAM be only thing would upgrade. I am currently on hunt for a 32gb kit. But since pandemic that is proving hard. added touch screen and NTrig Pen Digitizer was a big selling point for me. A lot of my blender work these days is in sculpting. So not having carry around my XP Pen 15.6 Pro Pen display me office is nice. Note that do have buy a pen/stylus separately. But Wacom Bamboo Ink V2 works really well and it's a third of cost of a Apple Pencil. So big bonus. As for 4700U in ENVY. 's insane. 8 Physical cores... In a laptop... I don't care that it doesn't have SMT/Hyper Threading. What I find nuts is that this low wattage ultrabook convertible laptop CPU renders blender scenes as fast as my Ryzen 3600 Desktop 6 Cores/12 Threads. That blows my mind.

gpo99m,SuggestALaptop,sounds like really a gaming laptop. One key item I strongly suggest for any student is get a laptop a Webcam. Something like this HP Omen on sale for 1299. However I have an alternate suggestion. Gaming desktop like this one for 599 Gaming monitor like this one for 219 iPad 128gb on sale right now for 100 off - 329 Apple Pencil - 90 student discount Urban Armor Gear iPad case 50 ------------------------------------------------------- Total price of this setup 1290 Here is why I suggest this route 1. Way more gaming value for money a Desktop and don't worry about heat-induced reliability issues gaming laptops struggle 2. 24 monitor is way better for gaming than 15.6 especially for FPS 3. Gaming desktop be upgraded down road especially video card 4. You get far more storage for your games vs. a laptop 5. Nice big monitor write papers and do research when aren't gaming 6. iPad be a wonderful and light tablet take class and use for notes research and reading e-books. barely notice it in your backpack and it gets lost or stolen aren't out much money 7. Gaming laptop be heavy thick and a pain lug around all time. And do really give off I'm a gamer vibe ALL time at college? 8. Gaming laptop battery life is terrible iPad is incredible. And everywhere go someone have an iPad charger ready. best of both worlds. A great device for class and library and notes and a way better gaming experience than a laptop. You sell your parents on idea by explaining value of not carrying a massively expensive MacBook Pro all over campus and instead saving money by getting a desktop for 'real work and having iPad for notes and research.,0.046,0.816,0.138,0.9794,1

gplz2q,SuggestALaptop,Since said wanted get hyped up I'll tell about my experiences my Dell XPS 13! To put it simply it's incredible don't have any affiliation Dell in any way and have pretty neutral opinions about company were wondering - build quality is quite impressive as I was coming from a MacBook Air Early 2015 model and was expecting really poor build quality in comparison but XPS holds up really nicely. - A more subtle feature of this laptop that people don't talk about or hype up enough is carbon fiber palm rest. 's soft touch and honestly makes my typing experience so much more enjoyable in general. 's nice that Dell put in this much thought when they could have followed trend that every other laptop was setting and just left us a regular metal palm rest and no one would have ever complained. - Seeing as 're getting XPS 15 and I have 13 I imagine power is going be absolutely amazing on your device. For me and my purposes my XPS has shown be a power-house. performs all tasks I ask it quickly and I've been able do light gaming on it though I have an integrated graphics chip. - thermals are pretty good on my machine. only ever gets hot when I play some games on it Sims 4 and COD mainly which is expected since I don't have a discrete graphics chip. Even when it does get hot though it does so towards back of machine so it shouldn't ever be uncomfortable. People are right when they say it gets really hot but for average person someone who doesn't game a whole lot or do much photo/video editing or CAD work it shouldn't get those points on a regular basis. Dell does this get maximum performance because by letting machine hit a high temperature it's allowing for peak performance happen for a longer time and then laptop thermal throttle and come down. - Now part that seem most hyped about -- screen! I have 4K version as well I have a 2-in-1 so configuration I got forced me get 4K display and it's so good! I really enjoy watching YouTube videos and shows or movies on Netflix this. 's such a game-changer because everything and I mean everything looks absolutely gorgeous on it. I started appreciate typing on Google Docs and just browsing websites more because colors are so vivid and I don't know how describe display other than crisp. Everything just packs a little punch font on this post looks nice. I hope this helped hype up and feel free ask me any questions!,0.028,0.815,0.157,0.9965,1

gplts8,SuggestALaptop,At your budget might be able find a laptop a Ryzen 5 4500U and 8GB RAM. That should be enough for your light gaming. Ryzen 4500U is a solid CPU for all sorts of stuff but specifically it was pretty decent integrated Vega graphics for playing some light games. Vega is way better than Intel but nothing compared an actually Nvidia GPU. However from what described don’t very much GPU power just a few basic games. I’ll try and find something in price range. EDIT actually based on this video could go for a Ryzen 3 4300U and 8GB RAM and still have enough performance for some light gaming. That would be more in your price range.

gpddvj,SuggestALaptop,Don't get that model!! You'll pay more for less Get this.

They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared Intel. also has a very capable little GPU that game at 1080p medium in most titles play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable buy 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY default 250nit screen. Get 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1089 for 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not skimp on screen and wifi on any of these configs.

gp69no,SuggestALaptop,AMD 4000 processors are absolutely legit They offer more cores for less money and less power consumption. only issue is that since Intel is so big and established they are able be in alot different laptops AMD is slowly starting be added better and better models but still limited in options. I recommend Ryzen 4000 series over pretty much all Intel chips because it literally is a plus at almost every front go ryzen. Intel i3 starts at 2 cores Ryzen 3 starts at 4 cores Intel i5 is typically 4 cores Ryzen 5 is now 6 cores. Intel i7 is typically 4 cores for most and 8 cores at crazy high end Ryzen 7 has 8 cores at very low power consumption. Linus did a test where a Ryzen 9 4900H was more powerful than massive laptops 8 core Intel chips using 90W of power while 8 core Ryzen was using about 35W. I'll link it here.

Unless really use tablet mode often your current surface book I’d spend your money on other features in another laptop. surface laptop is a solid ultrabook laptop and looks great and is super portable but not really that powerful. Compared surface book ’re missing that GPU power that comes in keyboard dock. ’re just going be reading and writing papers using excel and prism a little R and Matlab then surface laptop would work fine.

Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos.

Viewing angles are great IPS panel but its glossy finish it’s not best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops and it run your games smoothly.

gp6njr,SuggestALaptop,You get a hundred opinions on this question and they are all right. All wrong too. Mac-vs-PC question has been raging for almost 4 decades. Here is what advice I usually give. Go for Windows 10 Gaming especially latest AAA games Touch screen 2-in-1 and/or active stylus support You hardware that isn’t available on MacBook without using a dongle USB-A HDMI SD card slot Ethernet port etc or a really large or really small screen. most powerful hardware specs for least amount of money You use an application which is unavailable on MacOS Your budget is less than 1000 Get a MacOS laptop Impeccable hardware design and quality and when Apple does screw up they are more likely launch a repair campaign or warranty extension than PC manufacturers Top notch support online and via local Apple stores Way better included software like iPhoto iMovie Notes GarageBand etc. High quality screens well suited for photo video editing MacBook Pros support DP3 color gamut for example Benfits of MacOS ecosystem Especially use an iPhone including iMessage Keychain App Store Handoff iCloud Apple Pay Apple TV etc. You have more than 1000 budget Macs hold their value WAY better than PCs so some of higher upfront cost is recovered years later on resale So which is best for ? Hard say without knowing more. Generally ’ll find that comparing like-for-like specs pay a bit more for a Macintosh but not as much as might think and get a LOT of great free benefits like software above and better resale. I think most typical users find a Mac be more satisfying choice especially they use an iPhone. For gamers or people on a tight budget Windows 10 is clear winner. Flame suit on - ,0.029,0.793,0.179,0.9932,1
gp6njr,SuggestALaptop,Part 2 on what system specs ? Again varies a lot by use case. For most people 8/256 is bare minimum in 2020. That should be sufficient for typical tasks on both MacOS and Windows10. I generally advise people get more RAM and then more storage because You always add external storage but ’t add external RAM Applications and OSs released in future require more RAM than today so RAM helps longevity RAM in most laptops and all MacBooks is not upgradeable so get what get forever cloud makes local storage less critical do get tight on space However buying MORE RAM than provide exactly zero speed improvements. So overbuying is just a waste of money. 8GB is sufficient for most users in 2020 but 16 GB provides more future proofing. like keeping 20 Chrome tabs open your mail app music player video conferencing then 16gb is probably a good choice now. IF are working massive photo files that have lots of layers or very complex video editing ’ll know this is then might more than 16GB. Again more than 16gb probably know that very well. x200B Based on what ’ve said I think should look at 1 2020 MacBook Pro 10th Gen i5 / 16/ 512. 1799 2 2020 MacBook Pro 8th gen i5 /16 /512 1599 3 2020 MacBook Air 10th gen i5 16/256 1299 4 2020 MacBook Air 10th gen i5 8/256 1099,0.026,0.902,0.072,0.903,1

I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. has brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now.

gp8k5j,SuggestALaptop,I would look into new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips as they offer more performance for cheaper price and better battery than anything Intel offer. Intel is offering 4 cores for same price AMD is offering 6. Vega 6 iGPU in 4500U is almost as powerful as MX230 which is a dedicated graphics card. 's actually really impressive because such a small integrated chip is almost head head a completely dedicated graphics chip which consume more power. Here are some benchmarks between 2 I also recommend this laptop because it has 6 cores compared 4 cores in i5. And it should be cheaper.

gp83a3,SuggestALaptop,I suggest looking into new Ryzen 4000 chips that just were released. They are a little bit harder find but They offer better performance across board than Intel chips and use less electricity. Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles wanted game have option.

gp83a3,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure we find a touchscreen device that is a good value on a low budget. Lenovo Flex 14 is my recommendation wait for it come back into stock. comes a 4-core Ryzen 5 processor 12 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 IPS display. This combination should be just fine for uses listed. You use Lenovo's stylus draw on screen.,0.033,0.822,0.146,0.743,1
gpbymm,SuggestALaptop,Intel Iris and integrated are small graphics cards that are capable of pushing displays and LIGHT LIGHT graphic intensive work like light gaming But do 3D or rendering that leverages a graphics card a dedicated graphics card is usually required. That makes laptop chunkier and bigger for most part. 's needed cool down CPU and now dedicated GPU chip. I typically recommend having a capable GPU incase do it for your 3D CAD workflow. CPU is also very important for your work. I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. For your budget I recommend ASUS A15 This is a 2.9Ghz 8 core 16 thread AMD Ryzen 7 4800H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD GTX 1660Ti 999 ,0.0,0.835,0.165,0.9643,1
gpbymm,SuggestALaptop,Hi I think that 'll at least a mid range graphics card for your use.

I thought I would give a little more in-depth review so here it goes ’s equipped Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great IPS panel but its glossy finish it’s not best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops. Heat management isn’t best as device heats up under load and CPU throttles maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach point of hurting internal components Good upgrades available change SSD. ’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t case for most convertibles. ’s good on connectivity 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different windows precision driver has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum. And prefer a traditional laptop then I would recommend this Lenovo thinkpad P53s because ThinkPads are known for their great battery life amazing build quality and very good keyboards and it comes i7 quad core CPU which is one of best in your budget and great for your usage 16GB of RAM for smooth multitasking Good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15.6 inch Full HD IPS screen which is a must have for this price range thunderbolt port and high build quality.

For higher end I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of following lid is made from brushed metal it be opened easily one hand and case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. display part flexes easily and keyboard bends a little are hard typer. is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means 't connect external monitors using port. ram is not upgradeable so what buy is what get major con 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning would use Fn keys use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not best option are used mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal.

gpaoms,SuggestALaptop,Your budget is very limited but I got as close as I could. This is 419 and I recommend it your budget absolutely cannot stretch. your budget stretch a tiny bit more I prefer this. ,0.049,0.852,0.099,0.3926,1
gpaoms,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we find a general use device. I recommend ASUS M409 comes a 2-core Ryzen 3 processor 4 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 display. should be just fine for some light games as well as general use. But I highly recommend upgrading RAM and storage in future.,0.0,0.789,0.211,0.8481,1
gpak0h,SuggestALaptop,'s actually not a bad price and specs but for VMS I recommend more Cores. Do some research on AMD Ryzen variant. they have more cores for your VM work. Ryzen 3 is 4 core vs Intel i3 dual core Ryzen 5 is 6 core vs Intel i5 quad core Ryzen 7 is 8 core vs most i7 quad core Ryzen also has better battery life but are brand new so not many laptop options yet. I recommend this same ENVY but AMD chips. Configure this AMD envy this 2.3Ghz 6 core AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1080p try get 400nit screen as 250 is usable but too bright 799 ,0.054,0.808,0.137,0.8666,1
gpak0h,SuggestALaptop,that is not a bad option specs wise not sure about build quality though other options then I would suggest checking this ASUS Zenbook out because of following lid is made from brushed metal it be opened easily one hand and case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. display part flexes easily and keyboard bends a little are hard typer. is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means 't connect external monitors using port. ram is not upgradeable so what buy is what get major con 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning would use Fn keys use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not best option are used mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it charge up 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 9.5 hours.

gp6fwj,SuggestALaptop,I would look into AMD Ryzen 4000 series that just launched. They are more powerful and cheaper than any Intel counterpart.

No. So ’ll inevitably find yourself in a situation where wish had a webcam and don’t. laptop was going stay in one place all of time then an external webcam makes sense.

Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You get additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . smaller battery give 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect double get bigger battery life .

We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what . Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and dedicated buttons Audio is also average. Comes HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

gp97yc,SuggestALaptop,For 1500 have a quite a few choices and as a college student also get student discounts from some manufacturers like Apple HP and Dell. ASUS listed is a decent choice but in my opinion is more expensive than for those specs and is really intended be more of an ultra book emphasizing style and thinness than a workhorse for school. Given laptop last I would suggest paying a bit more and going a Top Tier manufacturer and one of their higher-end models aka don’t get cheaper models from HP or Dell . ASUS is a good middle-tier laptop manufacturer. You didn’t indicate what your major is or something take notes on so more data would be helpful for a specific recommendation. Here is what I would suggest generally 2-in-1 style HP Spectre x360 13t Dell XPS 13 Lenovo Yoga C940 Gaming not recommended as a general laptop as most gaming laptops are big bulky have terrible battery life often lack a webcam and screens are designed for fast refresh rates not color or clarity Razer Blade Stealth ASUS ROG Traditional0-style laptops Dell XPS non 2-in-1 Lenovo ThinkPad Apple MacBook Pro 2020 13inch 8th gen i5/16/512 1498 student discount Now I were actually going spend 1500 as a new college student I wouldn’t get any of these. What WOULD I get? I would get following Apple MacBook Air 2020 upgraded i5 not i7 8/256 999 iPad Air 128 on sale a t Best Buy For 349 iPad case 50 Apple Pencil - 100 That is 1500 on dot. And for that get a good laptop and a good iPad. iPad be awesome for carrying class taking notes reading ebooks consuming media and being an incredibly light little thing carry that won’t be crushed it falls off a desk gets wet or stolen. also serve as a second screen for your MacBook using SideCar. MacBook Air is perfect companion for when are ‘back home” doing real work. Kind of best of both worlds this route.,0.06,0.822,0.118,0.9766,1

gp938m,SuggestALaptop,Since 're doing VM work I suggest more cores than 4 get that Intel chip. I would look into AMD Ryzen 4000 series that just launched. They are more powerful and cheaper than any Intel counterpart they are also more power effecient and more secure. They are also VERY capable little gaming machines and easily do 1080p high on most popular titles. Extremely impressive for a integrated graphics chip wanted use it for light gaming.

gp354w,SuggestALaptop,Idk about Ryzen 5 I've heard 4000 series are great but haven't looked into it myself yet. But a GTX 1650 should do well. I have an i5 and a 1650 in my Asus Tuf FX505 which I think is an older version of what 're looking at. I haven't met a game yet that I couldn't manage medium 60fps. In fact Witcher 3 do a mix of high and Ultra at 60fps. Idk about rdr2 I've heard it's really punishing on hardware but as a general rule I've found 1650 do a solid job for price. an Xbox one s or a PS4 runs a game at 30fps expect 1650 run it at 60fps a little better graphics settings. Honestly most games run great. Crysis 3 does 60fps without stressing machine. it's not known for being especially graphically intensive like Witcher 3 or RDR2 then probably run it on high or Ultra it's a couple years old. But heavy hitters like above mentioned run 60fps some settings compromises.,0.046,0.783,0.171,0.9719,1

gp354w,SuggestALaptop,I have say your expectations and what hardware your buying is mismatched. A 1650 is one of lowest GPU for gaming GPU for laptops. Nvidia current lineup in terms of performance MX cards 1650 1660 2060 2070 2080. A detailed list is here showing top performance from insane workstation cards intergrated GPUs such Intel HD Graphics. Keywords look out for are Geforce GTX or RTX cards Quadros are workstation cards. So its nice that are getting a laptop. But ask save that budget for a better machine.

gp354w,SuggestALaptop,People are correct that prices are a bit inflated right now from covid but that also might not change for like another year.... So weigh your options. Honestly I think 'll be pretty happy a15 though I do recommend throwing in another stick of RAM once get it. Cheap and very easy do. Tons of tutorials online. And for god's sake sure have an SSD. There's generally a second slot for storage so don't worry too much buy it relatively small storage space. But seriously have an HDD instead of an SSD are not having a modern computing experience. Night and day difference. Seriously. You your OS and core programs on an SSD and easiest way do that is buy a computer an SSD installed already. Later add your own second SSD for storing games.

Personally I would get 15 because 17 just seems too large for me haul around. are going be hauling this thing around school I would suggest look at G14 as well your budget allows.

gp1nzb,SuggestALaptop,Hey there I was in same boat I'm a BTech 3rd year student and needed a powerful laptop for computation and very occasional gaming. These were my requirements in order of importance 1. A good display a good color gamut 90% this was most important thing for me as my current laptop has a horrific display 30-40% sRGB coverage this was provided by my university so I had no option but use it. 2. Processing power a good GPU and CPU 3. Build Quality I would prefer a metal keyboard deck 4. No red accents I think it looks cheesy So after looking around for almost 20-30 days I finally ordered Helios 300 yesterday from flipkart for 75k 1. has my requirements covered properly though it only has a 60hz display it has 96% sRGB and 73% Adobe RGB. 2. Has a pretty powerful CPU GPU combo i5 9300h and 1660ti 3. Has a metal lid and wraparound metal keyboard deck 4. Has less cheesy blue accents I considered several different options Zephyrus that's sold on flipkart didn't cut it because of pathetic display 40-60% sRGB coverage. I found this be case most of laptops being sold all of them had an average of 50% sRGB coverage. only exceptions being Acer laptop Nitro 7 and predator line. vivobook gaming has bad display that's why I ruled that out too As for Intel vs AMD 4th gen Ryzen does perform better than intel counterparts but currently we're only getting 3rd gen Ryzen in India and compared that Intel performs better best build quality then Trition 300 that's on flipkart is a very good choice it's has metal on all touch surfaces but do keep in mind that it still has a plastic chassis.

I thought I would give a little more in-depth review so here it goes ’s equipped Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great IPS panel but its glossy finish it’s not best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops. Heat management isn’t best as device heats up under load and CPU throttles maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach point of hurting internal components Good upgrades available change SSD. ’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t case for most convertibles. ’s good on connectivity 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different windows precision driver has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

However display is high resolution almost 4k I believe which means most games look a little blurry when playing at 1080p and GPU just won't handle anything very well try set gaming resolution native screen resolution.

gozdxx,SuggestALaptop,Hi! So have chosen three amazing products that definitely satisfy all that 're looking for however should know that gaming laptops generally don't focus on good quality speakers so I'm afraid most of your chosen products have around same bad-average quality speakers. Since 're looking for a light thin and 15-inch laptop a great display ASUS Gephyrus 14 is an amazing laptop best battery life of ALL gaming laptops in market right now. 's lightweight and powerful enough play any game now and upcoming games in future as well sound quality is not going be as impressive as a Macbook so don't get your hopes up on that part. On Youtube review of ASUS Gephyrus 14 linked HERE Austin Evans mentions that he doesn't like keyboard as much so keep that in mind. As for Gigabyte 15 I personally have Gigabyte Aero 15 GTX 1070 Max-Q and although Gigabyte laptops aren't that popular I tell that display laptop is amazing and I feel comfortable typing on it's keyboard right now although it's not without it's flaws I'm not a fan of dedicated numpad that shifts entire alphabetic keyboard left sound quality is horrible so invest in good headphones. fan noise of my laptop is very loud and I have wear noise-cancelling headphones whenever I play games but honestly fan noise is gonna be loud on all gaming laptops . temperatures average around 50-60C undervolted and battery lasts about 6-7 hours. But other than that I love my Gigabyte Aero 15. I'm sure that whichever product choose it's gonna be a dang good laptop. So 't a choice then choose whichever device that fill your needs and like look of laptop most.,0.077,0.79,0.133,0.9579,1
gow7zd,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of following lid is made from brushed metal it be opened easily one hand and case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. display part flexes easily and keyboard bends a little are hard typer. is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means 't connect external monitors using port. ram is not upgradeable so what buy is what get major con 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning would use Fn keys use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not best option are used mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it charge up 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 9.5 hours.

Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You get additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . smaller battery give 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect double get bigger battery life . This version has bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it be hard open it one hand Screen is Full HD IPS 144Hz refresh rate comes 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness.

They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared Intel. also has a very capable little GPU that game at 1080p medium in most titles play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable buy 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY default 250nit screen. Get 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1089 for 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not skimp on screen and wifi on any of these configs.

goetmb,SuggestALaptop,I just switched a Thinkpad after being very disappointed a Dell XPS 13 which didn’t hold up well at all. X1 Carbon was one of options I looked at for a Thinkpad I didn’t end up going it but I’d certainly think it’s better than XPS.,0.047,0.771,0.182,0.7433,1
goetmb,SuggestALaptop,As previous XPS 13 owner I would strongly consider that go Lenovo. I think astronauts use Lenovo up in space. XPS line is simply not worth it. They are like Apple products of Windows devices. x200B They break easily like literally my hinge broke off because it's held together plastic. that doesn't break then might have a blue screen or screen flickering or annoying buzzing sound from power supply. Too many things go wrong. Avoid trouble and pick up a Lenovo. You be much happier. XPS also solders their memory so only thing upgrade is SSD. Good luck.,0.132,0.705,0.164,0.5624,1

god8n3,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend a 13 inch Ultrabook either Ryzen 4000U series processors or Intel Icelake 10th gen . These devices are thin and light and help greatly as a student Since battery is most important when not gaming at 1200 get an amazing Ultrabook 8-9 hours of battery life. Since only play LoL iGPU inside those specific processor generations run LoL without a doubt 60 fps at 1080p near mid-High settings. obvious choices for Intel would be a Dell XPS 13 personal recommendation based on your needs XPS 13 2-in-1 HP Envy HP Spectre and Razer Blade Stealth runner up recommendation . DO NOT I REPEAT GET AN LG GRAM. THEY ARE THROTTLING NIGHTMARES. choices for AMD would be a HP Envy x360 personal recommendation lenovo IdeaPad S540 runner up or a Surface laptop. wanna save a quick buck older Ryzen based APUs Ryzen 3000U are still okay for LoL. 60 fps at 1080p low-mid settings Core i7-1065G7 4 core 8 thread is close a core i5-6500 desktop chip! at 25w 'll be able game really well on it it's igpu slightly higher than a 940mx but slightly below a mx150 is a few tiers lower than AMD one due it's mostly strong single core performance. Multitasking may take a hit BUT it supports higher memory clocks 3733 vs 3600 and performs on average better than ryzen in a single channel configuration. Ryzen 4700U 8 core 8 thread is a multitasking beast goes head head a great iGPU on par MX150 1D12 but for single core workloads may fall behind depending on your laptop has dual channel memory.

I thought I would give a little more in-depth review so here it goes ’s equipped Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great IPS panel but its glossy finish it’s not best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops and it run your games smoothly. Heat management isn’t best as device heats up under load and CPU throttles maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach point of hurting internal components Good upgrades available change SSD. ’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t case for most convertibles. ’s good on connectivity 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different windows precision driver has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

go93zw,SuggestALaptop,Will those apps run on base i3? Yes. For sure. Will those apps run performance acceptable ? Maybe. In USA upgrading from i3 i5 is only 100 and doubles number of available cores which provide a HUGE jump in short-term multicore performance. That is likely a no-brainer upgrade for most people. Why do I say short term? Because any lengthy processor-intensive task which heat-loads CPU run right into MacBook Air’s weak thermal headroom and begin downshift CPU frequency. At some point a sustained heavy load 4 core i5 and 2-core i3 end up performing about same as limitation becomes how much heat MacBook Air dissipate spoiler alert not much . MacBook Air is really designed for ‘typical’ workloads which just tax CPU for small bursts. MBA is more than capable of handling this type of load. Sustained tasks like rendering on other hand are not well suited MBA as it cannot keep its CPU cool enough over longer periods of time. One of my most ongoing head-scratching questions is why Apple does not connect CPU cooling fan a heat pipe on 2018-2020 MacBook Airs. Crazy. prior MacBook Air and all of MacBook Pros have heat pipes as do virtually all mainstream PC laptops. Is Base 2020 MBA better than 2019 MBP? No. MBA is worse in all but 2 areas. 2019 MacBook Pro is better 4 core 8th gen 25watt CPU vs. 2 core 10th gen 9 watt CPU Higher resolution screen DP3 color space suppport vs. not 100 Nits brighter screen backlight Much better thermal headroom Better speakers 2020 MacBook Air better .25 pound lighter and slightly thinner on one side WAY WAY better keyboard biggest downside of 2019 MacBook Pro is butterfly keyboard but it comes a 4 year extended warranty.,0.05,0.817,0.132,0.9738,1

go8ta5,SuggestALaptop,Asus has a slightly better cooling system because its fans are separated unlike Nitro 5 where its dual fans are shared between its CPU and GPU. However I remember correctly Asus has less vents than Nitro 5 so difference is Asus is only cooler by 2-3C. Also check refresh rates of their screens since Asus has a 120 hz screen compared Nitro 5's default 60hz screen. Asus though is more color inaccurate than Nitro 5.

Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has offer for price. 74Wh battery should net around 4-5 hours for light use. I'd consider it be reasonably well built for a gaming device but as always treat it well.,0.0,0.812,0.188,0.8957,1
go7l06,SuggestALaptop,I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen and being riddled security vulnerabilities. They also are extremely anti consumer and offer minimum refreshes over and over their chips while charging stupid high prices. G14 it's literally smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-11 hour battery life. also doesn't look all gamery so it be used in a professional environment. comes an 8 Core/16 thread AMD Ryzen 9 4900H 16GB RAM expandable 1TB SSD expandable Intel Wifi 6 card RTX 2060 Pantone calibrated 120HZ 1080pscreen 1449 brand new.

goaiki,SuggestALaptop,Consider Acer Spin 3 This model comes an 8th Generation i5 CPU which should perform well considering 're not doing anything really intensive 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. This configuration is good for average student so I think do your usual tasks without a problem and it's a 2-in-1 so get an IPS touchscreen that flip around into a tablet for presentations and media consumption. build quality on this laptop is pretty good considering that it's 680 and it's 3.8 pounds so it's fairly light. has a 14 display which is a sweet spot for most people. only downside is that screen is kind of dim but it's still usable. Finally keyboard generally has no complaints. 're willing spend a little more 750 check out Lenovo Flex 14 This one is also a 2-in-1 a 14 display but it has better specs. Ryzen 7 CPU is going perform better for multi-tasking 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD so that get a better and smoother experience overall. build quality isn't great but it should last a while around 4 years . Lenovo is known have good keyboards so there shouldn't be any problems here. Lastly display is slightly brighter than Acer's.

go3f3j,SuggestALaptop,base MacBook Air i3 would be decent but for 100 more I strongly recommend i5. Double processor cores which definitely help in a lot of use cases multiple chrome tabs for example . 8gb on a Mac is 'ok' meaning should be fine it given your use case but it is definitely on low end these days. thing about Ram is that buying more than provides zero performance boost and 8GB should be fine for . I would get i5 though. For everyone trashing MBA it is not a bargain but is a fair value. has an excellent screen Touch ID T2 security chip and all of free benefits of Apple ecosystem including iMovie iPhoto Apple Pay Notes Keychain iCloud Music a year of Apple TV free News etc. might be a little light on hardware but makes up for it software.,0.036,0.663,0.302,0.9935,1
go3f3j,SuggestALaptop,i think base version would work but since ’re getting student discount i’d say maybe upgrade something like storage or ram and go a little over budget for something that be more powerful in long run storage would prob be thing get more of unless have external drives back up often it makes things really convenient just have storage there i don’t really know anything about dell laptops i’ve heard they’ve gotten better but i guess it’s up ,0.0,0.863,0.137,0.905,1

I typically suggest envy for people who don't tons of GPU power but in this case a GPU is useful for heavier video editing. only downside for Spectre is 4K Screen KILL battery life and price is tremendously overpriced. are open something a bit different I know it's not conventional but G14 is a thin and light gaming notebook that doesn't look too gamery but is over twice performance of Spectre 8-10 hour battery. shreds in productivity tasks and since use an external monitor for most part this much power in a small formfactor might be perfect for .

I know there are more professional looking machines out there but for 1449 I think it's worth a look. I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen and being riddled security vulnerabilities. They also are extremely anti consumer and offer minimum refreshes over and over their chips while charging stupid high prices.

That being said there's not many options out there that have comparable weight/size that do not noise when put under load same/similar performance. laptop never overheats it always stays at a normal temperature. is a great laptop for taking class because of it's light weight and size. it's less than five pounds which is great. Also since bezels are quite thin it's footprint is much smaller than other 15.6 in screen laptops I've had in past which makes it easy put in/out of a backpack. Also battery life is great it last at least a couple of hours 're gaming. But for just light web browsing/homework assignments/notes it last around 9 hours which is great 're going be in class/on campus for several hours. power brick is 230w and a pretty big pain carry it but I usually don't because battery life is very good.,0.01,0.883,0.107,0.9541,1

gnt4k9,SuggestALaptop,are willing wait should. game keeps changing faster and although 10th gen intel laptops already catching shores of consumer market that headstart is only thing which keep intel afloat this season as new 4000 series by AMD is superior due 7nm process and this ensures lower power consumption which is most desirable feature for a laptop and besides benchmarks tell us performance is real rockstar more than lower average TDP. AMD has announced 4000 series in January but ongoing festival is causing delays release of products. For all I care it is more time for designers optimize designs and builds. So conclude my suggestion would be wait and watch.

gnnteb,SuggestALaptop,You know I'm guy who always recommends envy right? Lemme get my copy paste ready! Here goes! a laptop almost MacBook level build quality that performs almost double performance of MacBooks pros for a cheap price I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. has brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and 'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer leader in CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. also has a very capable little GPU that game at 1080p medium in most titles play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and sure get Intel wifi 6 card.

gnnh61,SuggestALaptop,I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen and being riddled security vulnerabilities. They also are extremely anti consumer and offer minimum refreshes over and over their chips while charging stupid high prices. For your budget I recommend ASUS A15 This is a 2.9Ghz 8 core 16 thread AMD Ryzen 7 4800H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD GTX 1660Ti there is also a 2060 variant for 100 more 999 ,0.089,0.866,0.045,-0.5984,-1

gnl5ww,SuggestALaptop,Are gaming laptops also good for general computer use? Performance wise yes weight and battery life in most cases no. I purchase something an intel core i7.. Do I set myself up for not being able play future games? Do I require an i9? Or so I it be a 10th gen i7? You absolutely don't i9 10th 9th gen i7 is usually more than enough for most AAA games. Any ideas which ones are notoriously bad for fan noise and heat? Can't list them all but I would recommend this Eluktronics MAG-15 Slim because of following comes GTX 1660Ti GPU You check below link see how GTX 1660Ti GPU scroll down for FPs and settings expected or ctrl f then type name of your game . Developed by intel corporation different laptop brands. According Dave2D it has great battery life up 7 hours regular usage and prefer a good battery life.

gnkezd,SuggestALaptop,Would be interested in a smaller but very powerful laptop at around same price?I recommend G14. I would look into new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper.

gnk0rh,SuggestALaptop,I would look into something that has new AMD Ryzen chips that just launched. You get better performance more cores better battery life better gaming better security and cheaper than Intel counterparts. iGPU in these chips are able play many titles at 1080p medium. 's extremely capable for a integrated GPU more or less performance of an entry level discrete graphics card. Don't buy and Intel chip Intel's UHD iGPU. 's basically unusable for gaming.

gnk0rh,SuggestALaptop,prefer a traditional laptop then I would recommend this Acer Swift 3 because of following casing made of brushed aluminum and looks very premium which matches your requirements since prefer a reliable build quality. keyboard is a chiclet keyboard typing on it feels spongy but get used it quickly. Drag and drop sometimes doesn't work as intended but that is easily fixed software. Screen is glossy Full HD IPS very good viewing angles screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant or get a headache are really sensitive . main and maybe only con about this laptop is how dim screen get as it is not usable in direct sunlight. Has very good heat management and it doesn't throttle. Speakers provide very clear sounds and maximum volume is pretty loud. Battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light medium usage.

gnidew,SuggestALaptop,new Ryzen 4000 chips just launched but are a bit harder find. They offer better performance across board than Intel chips and use less electricity. Don't buy Intel anymore they are extremely anti consumer and are also less secure due vulnerabilities and more expensive. AMD is dominating them in performance across all segments while being Cheaper. Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles wanted game have option.

gmykgt,SuggestALaptop,I've been thinking about buying a gaming laptop that I use for work/study but I also a ps4. Best of both worlds - work and play for a decent price.

gmykgt,SuggestALaptop,'s same as mine except 500GB SSD 1TB HDD FOR ABOUT 670 I got it 2 months ago. Here's issues I've encountered. 1. Audio delay- would be 3 secs when I watched videos idk 've faced that do I fixed it by editing some registry files. 2. Random screen blackouts they barely happen anymore and ppl online said it was a common issue for hp laptops so left it at that. 3. Keyboard randompy stops recieving input still gotta research that. 4. Another issue I faced is integrated vega graphics using 2GB of RAM haven't been able fix that which lead me needing upgrade 2 8GB RAM. I had 2 4. face this issue RAM constantly be at like 80-90% usage while gaming which lead my least demanding games lag and I had avoid playing till I upgraded RAM. So idk every pavilion user experiences these problems but based on my research online some do so yeah. Other than that my laptop doesn't overheat literally but get a cooler asap haven't already since tha fan is located on bottom so that cause your laptop overheat but a cooler under it it's great.

And then most of time won’t really notice difference. On other hand notice 4K resolution all time and have OLED love color saturation.

Make sure your brightness is at least 300 nits Make sure it's not a TN screen Get a decent color gamut and accuracy 70% or better I believe Most other things are dependent on your specific needs. Good luck!,0.026,0.7,0.274,0.9787,1
gn6fmx,SuggestALaptop,Laptops are usually alot about balance. Sure 4k is nice but your battery suffer. A 2080 is nice but your battery suffer. Screen- screen quality should be an IPS screen 300nit and above being acceptable. As color accurate as possible. 4K screens are pretty but pull too much battery power so it's not usually worth it in such a small screen. 1080p is fine 60hz are not gaming. CPU- Get a capable CPU. AMD Ryzen offers 8 cores for same power usage as Intel's 4 cores? Get Ryzen. RAM- 8GB MINIMUM preferably in a dual channel configuration. This give more bandwidth from RAM CPU. 16GB or above is ideal. GPU- most gamers love high framerates for smooth gameplay especially in first person shooters.amd and Intel both have integrated graphics which are tiny chips that run display and play games. At least Vega iGPU game. Intel iGPU is a joke 't game for most part. Those are low powered basic iGPU. Dedicated GPU are additional bigger graphics chips that are more powerful and push alot of frames. For gamers and content creatovideo editors. A dedicated GPU is a must because software uses graphics card help do work. don't game hard or don't due heavy video editing get by an integrated GPU. Storage laptops should only have SSDs nowadays. HDD have mechanical moving parts and use alot more power those parts move than an SSD which is just a chip. Typically 256GB should be minimum. Build quality- this is up consumer typically a metal or aluminum body as it's more sturdy but usually more expensive. Plastic sturdy laptop chassis work too but feel cheaper BUT they are more cost effective. Some users care about plastic feeling? Others not but either way it should be sturdy and not flex too much. Ports- should have as many ports as they give usually high end models have multiple USBC or thunderbolt ports but medium ones are now using USBC along USB A and HDMI ports.

gn69yo,SuggestALaptop,G14 is indeed a great option for your use case. 's below 2kg and it's small which is great for carrying it around on campus. 's insanely powerful and would definitely handle any 3D modelling software Solidworks etc or heavy programs like Android Studio. One thing I would note though is depending on availability of computers in your university might not such a powerful laptop especially since 're not gaming. What I've seen from my engineering studies is that despite my laptop being able run most of needed programs I still end up doing all relevant work on campus computers. Meaning that I was start uni now I would opt for a thin 13-14 laptop ideally an AMD Ryzen 7 4800U or 4700U processor 4800U 8 cores/16 threads vs. 4700U 8 cores /8 threads and skip any unnecessary heat from a discrete Nvidia graphics card. This processor is still plenty fast for all daily uses and coding. Lastly do decide be able carry out all work on your laptop and are sure won't be doing heavy gaming I think Quadro T-series graphics cards are more optimised work professional/engineering software. I don't know much about that though so should look around. EDIT Clarification on Ryzen -U processors,0.0,0.872,0.128,0.9778,1
gn69yo,SuggestALaptop,G14 is a pretty sweet laptop and has ALOT of horsepower for price and size. don't a dedicated graphics card and still a pretty powerful thin and light a laptop almost MacBook level build quality that performs almost double performance of MacBooks pros for a cheap price I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. has brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and 'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer leader in CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. also has a very capable little GPU that game at 1080p medium in most titles play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and sure get Intel wifi 6 card.

gn3vy4,SuggestALaptop,I've heard that this is a really good gaming laptop that should last a long time as Lenovo has pretty good build quality and Legion is reasonably priced for specs. Throttling is when your laptop basically forces CPU slow down conserve battery and keep laptop cool as well as keep laptop as quiet as possible. Throttling issues happen when laptop unsuccessfully throttles causing a loss in performance or does it too much that it's noticeable and doesn't offer a good experience. Most reviews don't say anything about throttling issues but hear a lot about it then I would say that it's not a great thing have in a laptop so steer clear. As far as fans go I'm pretty sure reviewers said that fans would turn on noticeably for short periods of time but then would stay quiet for most part so I guess could say it's like a regular laptop for today's standards.

Also thermals/fans are better on y540 Also for throttling do this thing called undervolting which really helps thermals at no real detriment performance. My buddy has one 2060 and throttlestop program used for undervolting he has no throttle or performance issues. And it’s a slick looking laptop that isn’t too heavy!,0.077,0.756,0.167,0.9624,1

gn2gxa,SuggestALaptop,Really depends on what ’re looking for. processor is going be your main workhorse for most tasks. i5/Ryzen 5 should be good for most part but ’re doing more intensive stuff and future proof yourself i7/Ryzen 7 would be a better choice. Also for Ryzen I would definitely get 4000 series huge step up from 3000 series. Intel hasn’t really changed much since 8th gen currently in 10th GPU is what ’re going for games or any graphic intensive stuff. ’re really trying game I would look at 1660ti minimum and RTX series 2060-2060 would all run current AAA games at a good frame rate. yo don’t that much gaming power then maybe a q640 or 1050 would be good or lower it’s just basic games run. Most dedicated GPUs be able run most creative software so could get a less powerful one than I listed above. although it gets more intensive may a better GPU like one for games Neither GPU or CPU be upgraded on laptops save for like Alienware a51 which runs for like 4k Ram is going be crucial in order run intensive games and more intensive software/big data sets. You could get away 8 but I would recommend at least 16 give yourself some wiggle room and future proof yourself. Dual channel ram 2 stocks gives better performance than single channel so be on lookout for that when purchasing. Ram is relatively cheap though so find a steal of a deal for a laptop without your desired amount of ram get 2 8gb sticks of ram for like 70 and it’s easy upgrade. Also cheaper for do yourself than it is upgrade Storage is important for speed too. NVMe is fastest. SSd still fast but not quite as fast as NVMe. HDD is slow and I would recommend against it unless your laptop also has a ssd that it use for your operating system so it boots up quick. A lot of laptops have extra storage bays though and storage is also cheap 1tb SSD be found for around 100 little more or less depending on brand. Screen is last real important conponent and it’s important because ’re going be staring at it all time. 1080p is pretty much minimum and go up 1440p your budget allows. 4K is cool too but I feel that 4K and 1440p isn’t that important on a laptop because screens are pretty small. 1440p would be great have though although it may be pricier than it’s worth. Higher resolutions also drain your battery faster too so keep that in mind. Next is screen refresh. 60hz is ok get a lower end graphics card as might not push that boundary much anyway. I would recommend a 120 or 144hz screen instead though as it makes your display look great and play less intensive games at higher fame rates and high end games as well GPU is strong enough. Battery life isn’t always great on gaming laptops but most manufacturers post typical battery life so see what prefer. I like have more battery in case I’m not near an outlet but game won’t really be able on battery for more than an hour or 2 high capacity battery laptops. Thermals are important but usually fix that software and lotions run warm for most part anyway compared desktops. I would recommend getting a laptop some fan control but that is pretty typica in gaming laptops and not so much on other types Then it’s pretty much preference. Metal builds last longer and are more premium. Keyboards aren’t necessarily subjective but it is still up your preference. Most trackpads have windows drovers so they’ll act pretty much same but some are better than others. Pretty easy fix a mouse though. Weight/form factor is whatever it be.,0.017,0.756,0.227,0.9994,1

They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen. G14 it's literally smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop.

No other room had ever had that problem. No one could figure out what was going on until one of our interns realized that classroom was only one a Mac. We decided try investigate other things that might be different about that room. Our intern came my office one day and said “Hey I know this is going sound crazy but lighting issue is caused by this Mac remote.” Sure enough that remote used same signal that touch panel used control lights.

gqapld,mac,Hi First idea I've had similar issues my mac having worse and worse wifi reception over past 2-3 years. Turns out flats around me are upgrading routers and wifi interference is getting worse as more people have powerful routers blasting wifi into my flat. Is your wifi network 2 4 or 5 ghz? possible use a 5ghz network avoid excessive interference. You check this by holding alt and hovering over wifi icon in top right of your mac desktop. Here click open wireless diagnostics then when a window pops up go top left and click window. You should see an option Scan. Click this and do a scan. How many networks do see? sort by RSSI is your network showing lowest negative number? -30 means better signal than -80 for example. Let me know! see networks here that have similar RSSI numbers your network they're on same channel and frequency then might adjust your wifi through your router. My tactic is narrow channel width of my wifi there's lots of interference. Say default width is 40Mhz but this means that might overlap other wifi networks and get bad signal stability. Lower it 20 Mhz and 'll lose some connection speed but gain stability. Second idea Not sure about air but macbooks usually have wifi antennas in their displays a small coax cable connecting antenna logic board. This cable run through hinge of display and has a change slowly degrade as open/close your laptop. I'd unscrew bottom of laptop and see it looks worn. I have similarly bad reception my retina macbook. I have a few spots in house where wifi works great due low interference narrow channel width I set up in my router. However I go farther interference from other wifi networks throw me off my wifi. Ultimate solution wire up. Get an ethernet cable and run it from your router your desk and get an ethernet mini-displayport or ethernet thunderbolt adapter depending on which connector your air has .,0.113,0.828,0.059,-0.9595,-1
gqapld,mac,are using a single router? or a mesh network? and is house a single level multi level brick? as those cause interference at longer ranges. while 5Ghz is a faster connection interference due environmental factors be more prevelent on 5ghz 2.4 has a little easier time going longer distance. issue sound 2 fold. since 're having wifi connection issue MULTIPLE devices at least know its THE NETWORK and not your MBA for that issue. since said yours was having trouble connecting hotspots provided they were in close proximity could have issues wifi SETTINGS. x200B ,0.035,0.937,0.027,-0.186,-1
gq9dfk,mac,have scanned drive for errors? whenever I have a drive errors happens every time I plug it into my ipad pro super frustrating it won’t show up on my mac but on my windows laptop. not sure why but scan and fix usually solves it. this usually results in some data loss though so I’d back it up before try this.,0.161,0.763,0.076,-0.5637,-1

gq7yv6,mac,I recently downgraded my 2011 iMac from High Sierra which was highest it would go back Mavericks. came OS X Lion back in day but that was a little too out of date for me. Getting everything running on Mavericks certainly is a challenge but since it’s not my daily driver and thing was gathering dust on my desk I’m pretty happy outcome. ’s flying as it came right out of box. And secretly I always loved Mac UI before Yosemite came around and made everything flat ,0.0,0.8,0.2,0.965,1
gq7yv6,mac,your Mac automatically downloaded El Capitan when reinstalled it that means it probably came El Capitan when it was new. What Mac do have because a 2009 or above run Sierra and High Sierra or a 2012 or above run Mojave and Catalina. I've found a good website here that compares every single version of OS X or macOS from Snow Leopard up Catalina. I'm running Catalina on my 2019 27 iMac and that's OS it came and it's ok but it's not best version of macOS or OS X that I've used. People have had good and bad experiences saying that it's really buggy and it's not stable so I would avoid it possible because Catalina doesn't support 32-bit apps and some stuff that probably worked before on El Capitan might not work on Catalina. My old MacBook Pro 15 Retina was running Mojave and I never upgraded Catalina on that until I sold it in December last year upgrade an iMac and I've been using Catalina because it's OS it came and I haven't had too many problems it. My MacBook Pro originally shipped Yosemite 10.10 back in 2014 and I upgraded OS every single year for 5 years up until Mojave 10.14 and I regret doing that because every year when I upgraded it especially later on High Sierra and Mojave that it started slowing down because of OS upgrades after a fresh install of each one. Mojave was a good OS as well and honestly isn't too different Catalina apart from dropping support for 32-bit apps and getting rid of iTunes and it was pretty stable and I didn't really have any bad experiences using it but it wasn't perfect and honestly wasn't too different High Sierra that came before it. High Sierra was like a modern version of Snow Leopard 10.6 because it didn't have many new features at all compared Sierra and it tried focus on Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements and runs on some Macs all way back 2009 but I found that be quite buggy and actually ended up downgrading back Sierra after a couple of weeks and it's considered be one of worst versions of macOS so I would honestly try and avoid using it in 2020. Apple has definetley made better versions of OS X and macOS. I could run any version of OS X right now and still be able run all of my Apps and have things like AirDrop and iMessage it would have be Snow Leopard though it's 10 years old now because it's such a solid OS and I still have an old Late 2006 iMac 20 running Snow Leopard and I still really enjoy using it because I've never had any software problems or bugs at all and it's still a really fast and usable computer and it's best User Experience I've had any version of OS X on an Intel Machine.,0.104,0.798,0.098,-0.7532,-1

gq7bxl,mac,I would go for Mac. Using virtualization software like Parallels or VMware run any OS inside it have enoug RAM of course it’s specially useful are a developer and test your program in multiple OSs Macs support them all. Plus ’ll still get responsiveness and generally comfortable feel of macOS and all of its perks when combined Apple ecosystem. is true build a cheaper PC and while Windows has gotten more stable over time at least me Windows is still painful use. Probably because I’ve used Mac all my life and friends who have only ever used Windows think I’m crazy. You also in theory build a hackintosh and it’s actually a very cool idea but it not be supported by Apple so something breaks it’s going be hard fix it. However I must also say that your budget is important have money get iMac for for it. But don’t PC do fine.,0.048,0.83,0.122,0.836,1

gq7bxl,mac,I am faster on Mac multiple screen plus terminal plus docker. I used Mac Windows Linux plus other OSes MacOS vs Windows - On a foundational level MacOS is more stable from UI quirks point of view. Unix foundation is solid uptime is rock solid similar SunOS. - Windows still have issue multiple screen scaling. A lot depends on hardware pick - Windows is moving toward MacOS route Linux subsystem winget package manager kinda like apt-get and recently Windows terminal lol - looks like a wrapper of PowerShell DOS prompt and Linux terminal - PowerShell has a good feature of passing objects instead of string - MacOS be locked pretty tight available encryption argue Windows too but Windows is a patchwork of security app which is hard be certain. Window custom build - not sure this refers Hackintosh. so Cost is pretty close real thing once get all nice parts. Then ’ll appreciate what goes in in designing a good system. Easy things go fast speed is what are after it’s harder them work well together. I was never completely satisfied my build. are after a build ECC memory for example your choices are pretty limited. - down side is software upgrade when apple upgrade OS they sometime throws a curve ball Hackintosh community which they hit fine community is great in that respect. From my experience it’s a matter of your times do fidgit it or are on “done that moving on” mode. Ultimately MacOS save time for me and doesn’t have UI peeves. Windows is getting there multi touch still lags behind on smoothness UI still lag behind etc. personally Windows is at least 5 years behind. Microsoft commitment a tighter release schedules is good. New features are heading in a better direction. Although they have more options customize i feel get more control on Mac. —- good GUI Unix under — done,0.051,0.731,0.218,0.9953,1
gq7bxl,mac,Why iMac Pro ? 's designed for heavy loading tasks in graphic/video processing not for casual desktop users. 's a beast for that specific region but not compare a 1500 custom build PC 're talking about gaming. iMac Pro and Mac Pro are 18 wheelers. You won't drive an 18 wheeler for a speed race but who would win everyone is towing 40 tons of cargo ? And have no for 40 tons of cargo why do compare price of 18 wheelers a Ford Focus ? compare it on same level. just a regular desktop computer both regular iMac not Pro and Mac mini would be more suitable. And 're talking about gaming or server-end applications get a PC.,0.035,0.916,0.049,0.5638,1
gq7bxl,mac,I JUST made this similar switch a few days ago. And let me put TL DR upfront TL DR OS X is a drastically less mature and capable desktop experience vs Windows 10. Ok so that bombshell out of way. I sold both my gaming laptop and desktop and grabbed a new Macbook Pro 16 Larger screen and better gaming on 5500m Debating returning it for a base 2020 MBP 13 as I do not really extra power cause I game Shadow and Stadia. Anyways overall learning mac stuff has been fun and interesting. VMware fusion experience is DRASTICALLY cleaner than anything I have used on Windows. BUT not as capable in some areas. Like 't present 16 threads VM as 16 cores. WHY? . Now be clear I got this mainly for MUCH better laptop experience Apple hardware and features offer. track pad and Battery handling is SO much better than any Windows PC. Like playing games on trackpad is not just possible I did it for an hour and it was a pretty 'not shit' experience in Destiny2! Stadia . Here are things OS X totally FAIL at vs Win10. - Multi Display handling - Connecting and disconnecting displays. - Updates and patches. - Arranging windows. - Swapping out windows. - Swapping between 2 windows. - Waking from sleep. - Re-installing OS. - Re-paring a bad patch. - Apps crash and it is a PAIN deal vs a Win10 crash. - over zealous security preventing from doing lots of little things. Remember early days of Vista UAC... that but worse. We are talking 20 minutes of OS adjustments and BIOS changes do something as simple as apply an image an SD card for a raspberry pi. and then get undo all of those things re-secure it. And those are just my issues in 4 days. - So lets start multi screen. You cannot turn off extra displays unless power them down or unplug them. - Connecting a display take a long time recognize ever. - Updates are like Windows XP days. Forever download and 40 minutes apply. - Arranging windows is a horrid experience Microsoft patented tech and solution in OS X is horrendous are used it in 10. - Working between multiple windows is a joke as click interact window vs Windows 10 which is aware of what window work on most of time by simply mousing over it. Something as simple as pausing a youtube video in another window requires 2-3 clicks. small but HYPER unnecessary! I take a 10 year old garbage PC and have windows 10 up and running on it in about 20-30 minutes. a High end PC be up and running from a blank disk in 10-15 minutes A clean install on a top end mac takes 1-2 hours! - Waking from sleep is a crap shoot. forgets what is plugged in changes main display loses displays loses mouse. is a NIGHTMARE! I just told it NEVER sleep except in laptop only mode. - has failed install updates TWICE! and took an hour repair both times. resulting in some apps failing launch and thus how I discovered how bad clean install process is. Aaaaaaaand. None of these are stopping me from wanting keep going. Using windows in a VM in unity mode gives me a DRASTICALLY improved desktop experience. And bootcamping into windows for other usability issues. is fine. do go mac. Save your receipt / get it from a place a friendly return policy. Cause OS X is no where near as smooth as Windows 10 in MANY areas. Sadly. when it comes basic desktop experience. Windows 10 just works. EDIT Yes so far Laptop experience has been totally worth all of these issues and learning experiences. IF I was desktop only though.... I would not go mac.,0.092,0.793,0.115,0.6404,1

gq401u,mac,which 2017 i5? as your issue COULD be resolved some minor fixing either hardware or software or how its used . regardless your workflow does NOT necessitate 16 besides screen real estate. 13 10th GEN ONLY has MUCH faster RAM 3733 vs 2666 in 16 . THAT would benefit your workload over 16 provided DONT require a dedicated GPU for your tasks and it sounds like don't it doesn't sound like a new computer based on tasks stated a lot of slow and Stutters be resolved restarting Mac more often as YOUR bottle neck is ONLY 8GB of ram 're using up 8GB OS compresses RAM usage down. over time though Mac free up used RAM it doesn't FULLY refresh until power flow is cut via restart or shutdown... NOT SLEEP routine has been put sleep more often then restart or shutdown OS or USER preferences become corrupted causing issues normal everyday tasks.

gppduq,mac,Depends on your budget. My personal recommendation is start from highest tier and just swap Fusion Drive for whatever size SSD .

In order of importance Upgrade an SSD Fusion Drive are very outdated Get best CPU reasonably afford Upgrade RAM yourself keep base 8 GB at checkout really go for Vega 48 but an eGPU do job more power down line P.S.

gpkr75,mac,No a 256GB SSD won't give different performance than a 512GB SSD unless one SSD is faster than other. amount of secondary SSD storage only affects how much store on your internal SSD not performance. I do agree on going i5 since 're not going see a difference in performance an i7 unless are doing compute bound tasks like video editing. You get more heat and higher power usage an i7 though which isn't as good for battery or component life...more heat is not a good thing for electronics. Also causes your fans run more and more noise which isn't great either. For me my Mac has a 250GB internal SSD that's really fast. And I have an external 512GB Samsung X5 SSD NVMe that's also very fast. So lots of fast storage. Great system. And get 16GB of RAM memory afford it that's really useful these days. I find that when I'm just running a browser memory runs at about 10 GB in use. Of course I like have lots of browser tabs open all time rather than opening and closing browser tabs all time.,0.065,0.871,0.064,0.2208,1
gpkr75,mac,In short yes in long term there is a penalty. Buy 256 are really sure never be close its limit capacity. SSDs have a specific amount of times that each block be written before becoming an unusable block. SSDs internal controllers try balance this by writing into blocks that have less amount of writes count they do this try maintain an uniform wear of all blocks. Bigger SSD drives have higher expectancy lifetime because they have more blocks distribute data into and wear less individual blocks. Also as an SSD goes full it speed goes down because of an extra effort needed by controller do its job when writing. Personally my 256GB “died” during an MacOS update I suspect because was almost full most of time and blocks wear too much. 512 is doing better for my professional needs.,0.134,0.812,0.054,-0.8522,-1

My recommendation since that many peripheral devices were needed was go CalDigit TS3 Thunderbolt dock. Yes. You’re referring it as a USB-C dock which is incorrect. USB-C is just physical port type not actual connection. This is a Thunderbolt dock connected Thunderbolt/USB-C port. Being that it’s thunderbolt ’re now connecting over PCIe bus and using a totally separate source of power. Those little hubs are great for quickly attaching a device here and there.

I installed system apps and my profile on Flash Storage and stored big data such as iTunes photo libraries videos and DVD rips on large HD. I saved up and a year later I replaced 1 TB HD 2 TB SSD and upgraded memory 32 GB . still goes well and now I use Flash as a temporary drive i.e. for Downloads folder. Now 2014 models had 128 GB flash. is not case any more - 1 TB FD has only 32 GB. I assume it would work OK for a while most often used system parts applications and user files such as caches fitted SSD partition. But soon experience slowdowns. I would just try avoid that last century tech spinning generation vibrations noise and extra heat but I had choose between 2 TB Fusion for 200 or 256 GB SSD for 100 I would probably go for ... 512 GB SSD for 300 🙂 especially it's going be a shared Mac where eventually family pictures and videos be.

golok0,mac,Ice lake 10th gen 10nm has lower base and boost clocks than whiskey lake 8th gen 14nm because intel has a semi-broken 10nm process which they've been unable scale high clock speeds. However because 10nm needs less power get same work done it boost for longer within same thermal envelope so in practice it does actually perform better unless 're keeping CPU's pegged a sustained workload and cause it clock down base clocks which is hard do any real world workload . And because it is 10nm it has more room for additional transistors which intel has used beef up on-chip graphics. That's why gpu is a lot faster on ice lake than whiskey lake.

goh9s3,mac,Your question needs a bit more elaboration in my honest opinion. How long do plan use it years ? What is it that study? More directly under what workloads are going put computer? What lineup are considering? Airs or Pros? With that out of way I give my two cents this hopefully going--be-thriving discussion based on what information have already given . ask me do three things i save up more money and buy a more recent MacBook I would strictly go for pros . ii You buy a decent MBP 13 2015 for €500 which is a decent option in MacBook lineup. iii I do not know whether or not considered Windows PC laptops but may could give those a go. Now hear me out about third option before smash a downvote. I am fully aware that specifically came Mac subbreddit this question from which I infer that only considered MacBooks. only reason why I am brining up PC laptops is simply sure that truly evaluated every option have at disposal and came conclusion that a MacBook is your best bet. MBs are good not very good laptops in my opinion but depending on location and budget they might be a less optimal/riskier choice. Repair cost/availability as a prime example . considered all of this than simply ignore third option I brought up and let's continue former two. Personally I was in a similar situation - in dire of a laptop a €500 budget and commited buying a MacBook - I would go a 2015 MBP 13 . Those machines get a year or two of support before becoming vintage and still hold up just fine today's standards. Their screens also blew that of pre2018 MBAs' straight out of water. reason why I wouldn't necessarily choose wait save up more is simply that on MBA lineup which I don't recommend first real choice is current 2020 model - 2018 and 2019 models have butterfly keyboards and apart form better screen don't really offer anything more than 2017 or older models - but they do cost more. Pro lineup is similar - 2016-2017 models have flexgate problem and 1st gen butterfly keyboards. 2018 and 2019 models are more solid in that regard but still rock same KBs. All in all were choose save up first modell I could recommend was a 2018 MBP but not a warm heart - but they go around double your budget. Two words about butterfly keyboard they are not 100% fail. But presence of this type of keyboard is still a risk factor that I would avoid I was spend money go around for. To sum it all up I would probably buy a 2015 MacBook Pro 13 based on info gave. x200B EDIT added and commited buying a MacBook ,0.05,0.835,0.115,0.9857,1

go4zjf,mac,Yes fusion drives are slower but problems are describing are coming from something else. Double check your temperatures and sure it is not throttling. Check activity monitor during import / rendering see what bottleneck actually is.

go4zjf,mac,fusion drive 100% makes sense on why your computer is running slow. No matter specs whether it’s a maxed out Mac. ’re running everything off that slow outdated rpm drive your computer is gonna run like hot garbage. Return Mac and upgrade an SSD no matter how long it takes it’s worth wait instead of stressing over hard drive issues. ’s stupid that Apple decides put a slow ass hard drive mixed decent specs pair it then screws user they don’t know shit about hard drives which then makes them think their computer is busted plus wasting lots of money because they didn’t understand what a fusion drive really is compared usual SSD’s that Mac’s come nowadays. wanted get a PC it’s super easy max out a good build at a good price but like Mac ecosystem for editing and other things go for it. I prefer use Photoshop and editing videos FCPX on my MacBook Pro quadcore i5 8gb ram integrated graphics instead of my main PC i7 8700 gtx 1080 16gb ram which is much much stronger just because it feels fresh and everything is simple for all my needs.,0.091,0.796,0.113,0.7615,1

Plug an external drive it and set Time Machine backup keep network connected and leave it on overnight. Sometimes a new system needs time reindex spotlight rebuild launch database update all apps syncing all data cloud server etc etc. it's still working weirdly after 1 day check Activity Monitor.

go5m51,mac,1. Screenshots mechanism is changed. Now a screenshot delay for 5 seconds before it's actually saved as a file so that interact capture data annotate on it or transfer other apps without saving as a file. And after it's actually saved as a file sometimes it have another random delay before it shows un on desktop. Read 2 for explanation why delay. 2. 's normal that a newly created file take several seconds before it shows on desktop because each individual file icon on desktop is not just a plain data block but a dynamically changing window . Each single file be monitored as a individual tracking handler in WindowServer system service. So it's actually not a good practice have a lot of files on desktop because each file takes up some system resources both memory and CPU. 3. Recent Finder window is result of Spotlight search. won't change until spotlight index is updated. 's designed for search for files quickly not a tool for managing files. You should go exact path that store these files instead. 4. As explained in 2 there be an inevitable delay before icon shows up on desktop.

gnyxd0,mac,Firstly which Macbook do have year and specs? Catalina should run very well on a more recent Mac. Now here's bad news. You cannot simply downgrade an OS. requires a full erase of drive. Apple's server has your Mac listed under Catalina now so in order reinstall High Sierra it may take a lot of steps. I could provide links but it's best contact Apple Support so they remove Catalina off server for and put back OS your Mac shipped . They may charge for phone call don't have Applecare Plus. don't do that then may go through these long steps from this link. Honestly I would recommend ever try out a new OS it's best create a partition on your drive and install it there so test it your apps. 's a very bad idea blindly upgrade a new OS version over your current setup. BTW Time Machine restore only bring back a previous version of Catalina. For example your original install was Catalina 10.15.3 and upgraded 10.15.4 then Time Machine restore back 10.15.3 but it does not backup an entire OS only files.,0.034,0.793,0.173,0.9823,1

gnxmcb,mac,Honestly it’s a preference thing. Apple care is basically limited warranty for three years plus two accidental coverages... Limited warranty portion cover for three years in case of any hardware failure and as long as there is no physical or liquid damage do not pay anything get it fixed. Accidental coverage has two tiers screen damage and any other damage... meaning physically/liquid damage your screen have pay a deductible 129 in Canada get a new screen. ANY other physical/liquid damage no matter how small or big Apple care limit cost 320 in Canada . For example spilled water on Mac and now it needs new top case screen battery and motherboard ... without Apple care are looking at easily over 1k in cost but Apple care maximum pay is 320 again in Canada To sum up keep two things in mind 1 Are careful your device or clumsy? clumsy Apple care is good value 2 Remember at end of day no matter who makes product. ’s an electric product and there is always a chance of failure. there is a hardware failure after first year are responsible for cost have look up deductible cost for accidental damage where are Hope this kinda clears it up a bit and helps a decision.,0.147,0.662,0.192,0.8442,1

gnm2db,mac,I'm pretty sure don't understand how use 16 in terms of battery. has a dedicated GPU and when it's activated by certain apps it drain battery because it's in high performance mode. I have 16 and I get full quoted 11 hours battery when used properly. There are only 2 major things that are causing battery drain and possibly a 3rd one. I have a 16 MBP AMD 5500 8GB card. 1 issue is AMD dGPU. drains battery. Period. 2 issue are apps being used that activate dGPU. Here is my short list of apps that are doing this. Chrome. Until recently it activated dGPU but has been fixed but it’s still a major resource hog and drains battery. Final Cut Pro X activates dGPU. Apple's Photos app activates dGPU. Adobe's Creative Suite . Resource hog and activates dGPU. Pixelmator photo editor. Activates dGPU. Connecting MacBook any external monitor activates dGPU. iMovie activates dGPU. Bootcamp. Running Bootcamp'd Windows works only on dGPU and there's no way switch it Integrated Graphics. Playing most games activates dGPU. These apps cannot run smoothly using Intel Integrated Graphics because MacBooks dedicated graphics like AMD 5000 series ship lower grade Intel Integrated Graphics. 13 MacBooks come better Intel Integrated Graphics run these apps since they don't ship a more powerful dGPU. Lastly 3rd reason for battery drain but not as major as dGPU is keeping screen brightness above 70%. 're using auto brightness control then this may not affect battery unless 're using it outside or in uncontrolled lighting. Without fail I get 11 hours of battery on my 16 MBP when I'm using apps that don't activated dGPU such as Safari and Apple Music. 's best for people verify dGPU is activated. Apple Menu-About this Mac. Intel UHD Graphics 630 and AMD Radeon 5000 Series GPU are listed then app are using drain your battery. 're unsure which ones then close all your apps and launch each one and verify dGPU is activated. Lastly leave these apps open and just shrink them into dock or close their windows they are still keeping dGPU activated so still experience battery drain when 're using basic apps like Apple's office suite. There is nothing wrong your 16 MBP's battery or computer or system management controller. These battery complaints have been going on for several years MacBooks that have dGPU's. More apps today are using dGPU so it's not always easy achieve advertised battery life. absolutely use these apps at a constant it's best plug in Mac for long sessions,0.053,0.831,0.116,0.9844,1

NO 13 has a dedicated GPU 16 models are running 9th gen CPUS and dedicated GPU ALL thunderbolt 3 Macs have option of using an eGPU some benefits and shortfalls a Dedicated graphics card give a good bump in FCPX and After effects performance pending workload and codecs used this is a work related machine I'd get best imac afford at least 1499 best 21.5 . that gives 6 cores a decent gpu WILL do any RAM and SSD upgrades when order as they're a PITA upgrade after fact 27 has USER upgradeable RAM which could help buying a better iMac and then upgrade ram down road still wont be able swap internal SSD easily x200B and use apps like Splashtop Desktop or screen share natively and control your iMac from your current AIR.

A maxed out i9 iMac is performance competitive BASE model iMac Pro. I’ll link thread that I started last year when I was trying decide between a maxed out iMac vs a base model iMac Pro. I ultimately decided go for Vega48 GPU a 2TB SSD. And it was 1000 cheaper than base iMac Pro base Mac Pro is not good value. Even a maxed out iMac i9 out performance wise. Vega 48 outstrip Radeon 580x base GPU of Mac Pro. intel Core i9 9900K has better per thread performance than a Xeon. Mac Pro only starts making sense when look toward higher end models Now so late in product cycle I would look in Used market or refurbs for iMac Pro’s that are 10 core or better. were going for an 8 core machine i9 iMac wins as far as value per dollar. But may get good deals for 10 core or 14 core models. But I say that I have been happy i9 iMac. is slightly more noisier than iMac Pro but it is still a pretty quiet machine and it still has user accessible RAM hatch on back. This makes it only other Mac other than Mac Pro that be RAM upgraded. and Core i9 iMac be upgraded 128Gb of RAM.

See e.g. i5-9600K vs i5-10600K. iMac is already known for not having good thermals so an hotter CPU not sit agreeably in that chassis. Probably not worth it in grand scheme of things. Of course this may be year of big case redesign which is likely come better thermals better camera better audio. But it may also feature soldered storage and non-upgradable RAM so ...

People would buy this they wanted most powerful Pro Notebook from Apple they're travelling all time and that desktop power. Apple are gonna continue updating 16 MacBook Pro and 15 MacBook Pro lasted for 13 years from 2006 2019. I could see Apple putting some of this stuff into 16 MacBook Pro like 12-Core Processors but in a few years I think they'll switch their own ARM CPUs and use their own GPUs instead of going AMD and using Vega 56 which is same GPU that's in iMac Pro. I just don't think Apple would have both a 16 and a 17 17 obviously being much better overall starting at 3 000 32GB of Ram and Vega graphics. would stop people buying high end 8-Core i9 version of 16 for 2 800. Having a really powerful Xeon Vega graphics and a 120Wh battery what would battery life be like when using Pro Apps like Final Cut Pro Logic or Photoshop and how efficient would it be?

Why does Apple always have be one Worried ? I don't give a rat's fuck what Dell puts out. I don't Windows and I don't a Dell. Apple's Macintosh computers are unique where they tie into Apple's ecosystem iPhone iPad Apple TV and Apple Watch and nothing compares Apple's UNIX-based MacOS. Dell's machine won't do shit for me that. Sorry Dell. No sale! And just because Dell put out a 17 doesn't mean Apple should just because they had one before. How about Lenovo making a 17 ?

Device keeps tracking battery usage including voltage changes temperature current usage and lifetime since it’s first powered and calculate approximate value of remaining charges and max capacity based on a chart which is derived from spec and statistics. That’s why ’ll see battery stuck at 100% for hours and drops like free fall after it hits 99%. That’s why fast charging be slowed down when battery is 80% full.

gmzcuv,mac,Agree everyone suggesting SnazzyLabs on Youtube. Some very helpful videos! Some things I wish I’d have known when I first switched 1. People recommend a lot of add-on tools for improving gesture control window management etc. Ignore that for now! Most people benefit from these but explore what Mac offers first. Play around gestures hot corners and mission control and find some settings that feel good and work well for . After a couple of weeks when really know what your Mac ’t do out of box there are a ton of good tools out there fill in gaps. 2. Command Space pulls up Spotlight and lets search your Mac easily open apps etc. find yourself using it but also find it limited check out Alfred for a search bar customize and program functions . 3. work audio might eventually find someone recommending SoundFlower as a way solve a problem recording / rerouting system audio. Do not do it unless absolutely have — it be a mess remove from your system and is notorious for causing more problems than it solves. 4. Install AppTrap it’s available by Homebrew — it’s a simple utility that ensures all relevant files are deleted when remove an application. 5. Command Delete let delete files. Function Delete behaves like Delete on a PC reverse backspace . 6. options for Keyboard in System Preferences are robust as hell. You set text replacements customize shortcuts and create new shortcuts for any app. This is often overlooked but one of my favorite native features in macOS. is also where toggle autocorrect have any issues it. 7. find yourself frustrated way media keys work aka expect it pause your music so watch a YouTube video but instead it is play/pausing YouTube video and not your music install Mac Media Key Forwarder. You set it prioritize iTunes or Spotify instead of controlling whatever media is active on screen. 8. At some point find yourself running out of storage and may find that “System Storage” is taking up way more space than feel it should. this happens go straight SnazzyLabs — he has a great video on this and honestly I don’t know a MacBook user who hasn’t run into this problem over course of years of use.,0.082,0.772,0.146,0.9706,1

RX 580 is a powerful Graphics Card and Apple still uses Radeon Pro 580X in baseMac Pro 2019 which is just ridiculous and they use 580X in high end 27 iMac so 'll be fine graphics. good thing is that always upgrade it down line a Vega 64 or a Radeon VII in a few years machines still performing well.

At that price I would buy a brand new 27 iMac straight from Apple or a 16 MacBook Pro. only reason I would buy one is it was under 1 000 and was fully loaded 12-Cores and 128GB of Ram a few Terabytes of storage. You could probably buy a 2010 Mac Pro now and keep using it for another 10 years really wanted kept upgrading graphics and storage on it but 'd be stuck on Mojave forever and a 10-year-old computer there's only so much performance get out of it.

They provide more power for devices and bandwidth for data. This would be your best option. google usb daisy chain should get some good info,0.034,0.86,0.106,0.6908,1

gmozp3,mac,Generally yes There are various modes of sleep a Mac go into. At this point your question only describes fact your laptop screen goes sleep but this is different from your computer actually going sleep. Regardless of your settings and assuming your MacBook Pro has a continuous power source then a system event such as copying a large amount of data continue occur various parts of your Mac go sleep.1 This is because your Mac is in middle of an action such as copying files it not go entirely into sleep mode e.g. your display may go sleep but your drives are still fully powered up for read/write purposes . In terms of speed at which data is transferred this be affected by a number of factors but in your scenario transfer rate should not be impacted. Of course 're copying a large amount of data it is recommended have your MacBook Pro plugged into an AC power source.

gmul54,mac,I have a 2019 27 iMac and it's great! Here's what I would recommend in order of importance SSD - So many people try save a few bucks a Fusion Drive but it really hinders performance. SSD is way go choose a low capacity always use external SSDs for archived projects and resources. CPU - CPU is core of computer. CPU pick be for life of computer unless void your warranty and break into your iMac . I would recommend getting best CPU reasonably afford. I personally got i9 but i5s should be good for most purposes. GPU - Every 27 iMac comes a discrete graphics card which already puts it above 13 MacBook Pro have since only 16 get discrete GPUs afaik . Vega 48 is overkill unless do heavy 4K editing. Besides always add an eGPU down line as prices drop in future. RAM - You got this one down. Upgrading yourself saves a ton of money. Just be sure get right spec from a reputable brand like Crucial or OWC . x200B I got my iMac last year same mindset. I currently have a working 13 MacBook Pro which is fine for most purposes. However I wanted some extra overhead for audio production Logic Pro X video production Final Cut Pro X and graphic design Affinity suite .

This means that now I have a blank canvas. So my main question would be What OS should I Run on my Frankenstein? Currently I have El Capitan running on it should I keep it or upgrade Catalina or High Sierra? answer is yes would it affect gaming performance like CS GO? I decide upgrade it I go back older versions whilst keeping all setting and files? My Franky thanks all in advance!,0.012,0.843,0.145,0.9548,1

I prefer use external SSDs for libraries and project files but just sure don't go for Fusion Drive and please no spinning hard drive for that matter! . Now for video editing really a good CPU GPU and RAM. I should note that GPU usage depends on program. I heard somewhere that Premiere may not use GPU so I would definitely prioritize CPU. Final Cut is optimized either way so that shouldn't be an issue. For RAM choose 27 upgrade RAM yourself. So get 8 GB start then upgrade 32 GB. Here's a link RAM I chose. Basically I would advise a 27 SSD storage and base 8 GB which upgrade later . Then it's up how far spec out CPU and GPU but I should mention that have CPU for life of machine while GPUs be connected externally through use of an eGPU I should also note that there are rumors that Apple update iMac relatively soon but who knows what that really means . However I stand by reliability and stability of 2019 iMac so I think it's a solid option as long as bezels don't bother they don't really bother me . Good luck!,0.031,0.798,0.171,0.9843,1

gm5vln,mac,Hi Tough but exciting position be in! Getting a new Mac is always fun. I am somewhat of a fanatic and have several Macs. Looking at your hobbies and usage I have say I would probably go a different machine and setup. As good as it is I wouldn't go 21 iMac for a couple reasons. First in long run I don't think be happy smaller screen size. I have 27 and like it but almost wish it were bigger sometimes. And for being a photo enthusiast I think your going something larger in long run. Second Apple is slated come out a completely redesigned iMac line soon. This design and architecture is running long in tooth. So anything have your heart set wait for new ones and get one of those or take advantage of older model price drop. However my recommendation would be go new 16 MacBook Pro. specs and reviews are off wall. is a great machine amazing technology. gives power for Adobe apps and easily hook it up a reasonably priced larger external monitor and have 2 screens work on which is incredibly helpful. In addition it gives flexibility take it jobs or events. is always nice have a nice Home Workstation setup but then also have portability option. Look at new 16 read / view some reviews and think about it. Good luck let me know more help R.,0.029,0.728,0.243,0.9961,1

gm5vln,mac,Here is what I would do I was . Old iMacs go for dirt cheap on eBay. You easily find a mid 2007 iMac for 100 dollar or less or newer get a good deal. Buy one of those and use it an external hard drive or ssd that find for 100 ish. This machine is in no way adequate for a proffesional but is a great machine for small tasks albeit a bit slow. runs el cap but for a sub 200 dollar price point completely solves your storage problem as well as gives a fully functional iMac that perform basic side tasks and stuff that a pro would and doesn't require a expensive high performance machine. I would recommend upgrading ram 4 or 6 gb choose follow my advice . Now buy other new iMac of your choice a upgraded processor or base model. Because now have 2 processors convenience equivalent of a high powered one enough ram combined be fully adequate without shelling out a bunch of money for pricey ram and 2 harddrives in 2007 iMac and external one use it while they are slow they be used for files don't use often that are massive and don't on main machine because hard drives store a lot more data for less money along convenience of a low powered secondary machine. Really its a win win win because get everything in your price point and more while not having shell out a lot. Plus also have 3 machines now your MacBook. I assume understand because use an old MacBook that they last for a while without being too inadequate. same is case for iMacs.,0.043,0.81,0.147,0.9867,1
gmcrjf,mac,So macOS purposely grab “stuff” and toss it into RAM. cache in RAM all kinds of data so that quickly access it. also take some and allocate it for itself - this show up as “used” though it’s just technically being reserved for whatever needs it next. This way millisecond it’s needed macOS already has it allocated and ready go. That’s just how it’s designed. In “Activity Monitor” app there’s a chart at bottom labeled “Memory Pressure” - this is where look. As long as that’s green ’re all good. There are highly technical articles on subject ’re curious read.,0.0,0.924,0.076,0.7717,1

gmcrjf,mac,Check activity Monitor. Its under Applications Utilities,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gmcrjf,mac,I'm going quote an answer I posted from a similar question. What ’re probably referring is inactive memory which is memory in RAM that was once needed but not anymore. Say in case opened Microsoft Word did a few things and then closed app. MacOS predict likelihood may use this application again within a certain timeframe. This concept is known as ‘temporal locality’ and so application start quickly again because data still exists in memory. As there is a competition for memory resources by other applications MacOS allocate resources by removing some of inactive memory allow memory be stored in active memory memory currently being used by applications . This is a fairly old article but it’s a good read based on topic Keep in mind too that shouldn't really pay attention memory usage provided by CleanMyMac. Instead look at Activity Monitor's Memory Pressure. This memory pressure shows how efficiently resources are being provided your processing needs. Green is good. Amber is okay. Red is bed. red should indicate that memory resources are scarce.,0.03,0.841,0.129,0.954,1
gmcrjf,mac,Look at your activity monitor. Sort it by Memory so it show most greedy at top. Is there something or multiple things that are using bulk of it? I have found that some tasks stay open running though I think they're closed. You end task from activity monitor. kernel task Is one that kills me. doesn't take that many apps there's just one that's greedy.,0.125,0.846,0.03,-0.7665,-1
gmcrjf,mac,That's exactly how a modern operating system should do in memory management. Because unused RAM is wasted RAM . All modern operating systems have implement dynamic virtual memory that use all physical RAM AND hard drive at same time as memory space for user application. guidance of such design demands OS do two things 1. Fill up physical RAM as much as possible. 2. Avoid unnecessary changes memory allocation. Since a modern application frequently request and release memory from system it's waste of time rearrange overall memory allocation every time. OS tend keep released memory still associated original application that requested it as a cache space so that when application requests for memory again bet it it be allocated in no time. OS dynamically estimate activity of each application and determine when these preserved memory be released. In macOS this estimation is called Memory Pressure measured from various factors. Generally most people find a system kernel processes called WindowServer takes a lot of CPU and memory process. That's because WindowServer is bridge between application and graphics hardware. When an app wants draw something on screen WindowServer is one that takes demands from app and tells graphics card what where and how draw it. So when have multiple apps many windows on screen or have a lot of files on desktop WindowServer stay in busy state all time.,0.06,0.908,0.032,-0.6808,-1

gldmxj,mac,For those who didn't see my original post on May 5th LINK I am spray painting a 13 Unibody MacBook Pro in Satin Black. Journey so far Completely gutted shell Then prep work begins. I sanded down all parts started 120grit then moved on 240 and finished 400. I then filled in all scratches and dents as best I could Then I sanded it down 240 then 400grit and it is basically ready for primer I decided best way paint them would be hang them from ceiling that way I could paint both sides of them at same time. So I used my loft space paint them I gave them 4 light coats of Etch Primer leaving 30mins between coats was halfway through priming top case that I suddenly had idea remove DVD drive slot and Kensington lock as I was planning on using a 2nd hard drive in place of DVD drive anyway and I would regret it I didn't do it. So I took it down and filled in slots While I was waiting repaint top case I waited 24 hours for etch primer harden on other two parts then very lightly wet sanded it 400grit sandpaper give it a smooth finish. This is how I hung pieces from ceiling Masking tape and string I also masked areas where logic board makes ground bottom case I then proceeded paint Satin Black 4 light coats paint looked really patchy because of light coats and I was worried it was going look crap but I held out hope that Satin clear coat would fix that. While Black was hardening I finished priming of top case and it looked so much nicer DVD slot delete 24 hours later Black was ready clear coat and top case was ready sand. Top case primer sanded down 3 light coats of Satin clear coat followed by a single heavier coat finish it off Satin clear coat made all difference and really made final finish so much better. insides look crap but 're never going look at them anyway final results for top and bottom panels There are a few imperfections and some dust that settled on paint but I'm pretty happy final finish. turned out much better than I was expecting I'm honest! goes show that put in prep results speak for them selves. top case is currently in loft after having 4 coats of Satin Black. 12pm tomorrow I be applying Satin Clear coat. Then 24 hours after that painting be finished. I'm currently waiting for a White Macbook Keyboard in mail which I be taking Key caps from and transferring them keyboard for this laptop.

glzucd,mac,Well anything your laptop has a higher retail/resell value over its life expectancy. Acer not be worth much older it gets.

For me my MacBook works seamlessly all my other Apple devices its simplistic. most frustrating things I dislike about my Windows PC are software and drivers being buggy. Applications freezing blue screen after updates incompatible drivers issues random Windows Activation prompts showing up for no reason etc. I’ve had significantly more problems on my Windows computer compared all my Mac devices as a whole.,0.121,0.792,0.087,-0.4898,-1

glr2x3,mac,What is making your MacBook feel like it’s slowing down. Is it always feeling sluggish when playing around in OS? Or only during certain workflows like having Photoshop and Illustrator open at same time? You likely have low RAM for Adobe programs. 16GB is new standard for graphic design but it all depends on what ’re doing. Perhaps update RAM 16? I forget those have upgradable RAM. Also your storage is likely a slow spinning harddive. Standard laptop storage is now super fast like 10-20 times faster. Putting an SSD and RAM into your laptop would it feel like new again. But ’re planning on a new MacBook Pro anyway sure it has at least 16GB RAM. Personally I would upgrade 32GB RAM since likely keep laptop for yet another decade. I keep mine forever also Edit for graphic design I recommend 1 799 13-inch MacBook Pro that comes 16GB RAM and 512GB storage 4 thunderbolt ports.

Once clicked a bunch of markup icons show up look towards left side. You’ll notice a handwritten letter A. This is for signing. I just grab a white piece of paper sign it and hold it up webcam capture it. After that it’s really simple do it. Seconds. You move align resize your signature anywhere in PDF.

's a GTD Get Things Done and groupware tool but not a knowledge base nor a good journaling tool not mention data storage. it's real then he must have some SERIOUS PROBLEMS in his workflow. Outlook is infamous for locking up all its data in proprietary repository and there is no way change repository path which is located at /Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office . Moving these data between machines would be difficult because 're supposed use Outlook built-in archive export/import feature for this task. I'm not sure simply copying files within that folder work. A far as I know some people had tried move files somewhere else and symbolic lines old position but Outlook just ignore it and recreate a new profile instead. So best solution would be manually archive and export every time. For a long term solution first he must learn NOT put all data in same stash because it means that 'll go though 6TB of data for only 1MB changes inside that way. Try get a profession knowledge base / journaling tool like DEVONThink and classify data into different categories. have trouble making categories at least do this Ongoing Project Reusable Resources Recently closed projects Archives So that only keep ongoing project on local drive and this should drastically reduce data size that be synced every time.

I know 7590 is a beast but from moment I saw it I didn't like bottom bezel and aspect ratio of otherwise beautiful OLED screen. When I saw projected 16 10 FHD screen of 2020 version floating around on interwebs I slammed on brakes! My only worry is price. I'm in Canada and I was getting 7590 OLED 16G Ram i7 9th gen and 256G SSD from Dell for 2100. Do think 2020 version be much more expensive? Money's an issue so I'm vacillating. Update So I bought unit. bottom bezel has really grown on me. I find it looks cool and after all I've read about OLED screen 16 10 doesn't appeal me anymore. Heard something too about battery in 2020 iteration being inferior 7590. Also 1250 of unit's being subsided so I'm a pretty happy camper! - ,0.059,0.816,0.125,0.9251,1

gbfwid,Dell,Hey all I'm interested in getting myself a Dell 13 or 14 laptop. I'm looking at following since they're what's available at Dell Canada Latitude 5300 - 1400 CAD sometimes? Inspiron 7490 - 1100 CAD right now Inspiron 5391 - 900 CAD right now My main requirements are 1080p IPS/VA screen quad core so probably i5 upgradeable RAM and be as small as possible - these three in particular seem similarly sized so I chose them. Can anyone give me a recommendation between three or at least tell me what main differences are they're specced similarly? I do care very much about durability and repairability as well so I'd like know about those in particular. I'd also appreciate recommendations for other laptops there are better ones look at. I'm an Engineering student in Calgary Alberta and I'd like it be portable and run SolidWorks/MATLAB well. I had a ThinkPad X240 previously whose size I really loved but Lenovo's latest offerings aren't that great anymore for same price considering soldered RAM. Thanks!,0.025,0.851,0.124,0.9059,1

gbfwid,Dell,Hi! Swede here. I'm very much interested in new 13 XPS 9300 mainly use browsing and play around Linux. I know I could buy a cheaper laptop for that but I really like 9300 and I don't mind paying a few hundred extra for it. However 4K i7 and 16 gb RAM seems a bit much... A few questions though hoping help me out. 1. Do think 8 gb of RAM be more than enough for my needs? I won't do any heavier stuff but still I went 16 gb looong ago. Kinda sucks that it's soldered on and RAM is only thing I would LIKE upgrade but since it comes i7 and a 4K screen we're talking a 500 difference. 2. How come frost white is unavailable? Really like look of it but there's zero options for that in Sweden. Same Germany I think checked out of curiosity I still a nordic keyboard only UK has it. Will it be released here? Absolutely ZERO help from Dell on this one it's like talking a wall. 3. 4K seems like an overkill for a 13 inch screen I scale it anyway. But are there any differences in quality of panels otherwise? I prefer glossy screens but it seems I have go a matte one I choose FHD non touch one? 4. Are there any differences in hardware for normal and Developer Edition?

gqqx7q,Dell,Thoughts on my current XPS 15 9500 Pros ★ No Coil Whine!!! I used own a XPS 13 9360 and coil whine is always most annoying issue that I faced especially when I am in a quiet room. Finally Dell engineers was able solve issue! ★ New mold. By adding 16 10 screen ratio and do some modification on vent and ports this machine is finally built for consumers! ★ Low heat. I thought 10875H would be generating a lot of heats but machine stay mostly cooled when I ran Path of Exile. When I tested R20 fan was not running at peak. Dell was able engineer it very nice and is just as expected! ★ Four sided InfinityEdge Display! 16 10 really made huge different and I compared it Zbook Studio G5 G5 was just not enough for me. By way Dell also put Windows hello facial recognition into ultra thin bezel on top which is amazing! ★ Long battery life. I think it might because I chose Full HD and that is why it last for more than 8 hours. Not sure how long would 4K last. ★ 60W PD charging. show that I am connected a slow charger but it still charges laptop when I was running Cinebench R20. ★ Powerful Performance. I was surprised that performance is similar my Ryzen 7 1700x. Cinebench R20 shows that single core performed better than Ryzen 7 1700x. Cons. ☆ All type C ports. ’s good that it comes DA20u about half size of DA200 without ethernet and VGA port but there is no Type A or HDMI. Also there are only 3 type c ports while xps 15 2in1 has four. ☆ No dedicated microphone mute key. I see that F9 does not have other command on it. I hope Dell would add mute key on F9. ☆ Page up and Page down is integrated. For those of use a lot of pg up and pg dn like me might get used it two hands.,0.056,0.811,0.132,0.9848,1

gqdeln,Dell,Nothing like this happens by mistake. There is usually a marketing ploy behind this. Check out model numbers / names of HTC phones. Fortunately they confused people so much people stopped buying their phones and business model tanked. I suspect that Dell wants either reset model numbers since their scheme led them down a cul de sac or they be able clear out older models and stock by making it unclear which model is newest. When they release a new model it takes time for production process ramp up become affordable and market demand grow. So they inevitably still have a few months supply of previous model in pipeline and probably not made yet.

gqv1bo,Dell,I have this model smaller 56whr battery. I get around 7 hours just watching YouTube or Netflix at low brightness. There are also still thermal issues this model especially gaming but I don’t imagine it’s as bad as higher core i7 and i9 models. Undervolting has been disabled but when I play game I either play on cool or optimized mode through dell power manager. For a little bit older games ex Planet Coaster and GTAV I get 60 and 80fps respectively on cool CPU temps at around 65-80c. On optimized mode I get 80 and 100fps respectively but CPU temps reach 99c and it throttles.

Sadly 3rd-party batteries tend be less reliable than Dell so better try local Dell service firstly. they don't have one new not refurb or are not willing sell it for a reasonable price roughly 100EUR range be persistent and give them a list of authorities and media where 're going complain . I understand relevant consumer protection legislation in EU is underway but not in power yet.

gqrath,Dell,Lol why TF ur disabling Turbo Boost man that's like throwing your money out of window! Anyway undervolt settings are different for each user because none of CPU/GPU are made same welcome silicon lottery! . Basically gotta figure out undervolt setting for your laptop by yourself. Also your laptop has latest BIOS that may prevents from undervolting due plundervolt so downgrade older BIOS necessary. For CPU First turn back on Turbo boost and download throttlestop. For your starting point set CPU and cache -125mv and use TS Bench test CPU's stability. 1 of 3 tests give back error then have dial back undervolt setting maybe -100mv or whatever till tests no longer produce errors. tests don't produce errors at -125mv setting then increase it -130 -135 -140 etc. until your laptop BSOD. trick is undervolt as much as possible but undervolting too much is just as bad as disabling turbo boost. For GPU Undervolting GPU is a bit trickier but often time not necessary because Turing GPUs are easy cool unless your laptop sucks donkey balls. For this MSI afterburner. Tutorial on how use it is over all internet so just look it up. I think 925mv is lowest should go. After done toying your system just perform a stress test using this guideline here and let it run for 20-30 minutes. won't kill your laptop since it's as bad as playing AAA titles at ultra settings maybe lighter in some cases . Make sure power management/fan setting is set max so I see best your laptop give. In HWInfo64 focus on CPU Package PoweGPU Package Power supported . should sustain 45W/80W respectively while running at 85-90 Celcius/70-80 Celcius respectively. Obviously zero sign of thermal throttling.

gqk53g,Dell,I hate break it ... but a lot has changed in 15 years. No computer reliably last that long now. Your average lifecycle on a machine be 5 years - and that is pushing it. I would say go for XPS and get best graphics card put in it plan on going long term. XPS hardware is significantly nicer than G series gaming laptops. Since aren't a gamer definitely appreciate aesthetics as well. G series gaming laptops are budget line - below Alienware. is in same line as Inspiron laptops which are below XPS line. I would say go XPS as aren't going see a noticeable difference between those two video cards don't do any serious gaming. They both work fine for editing etc. Mostly software has not caught up raw power in hardware so should be fine for a few years. I would imagine this is a 9th gen i7 are referring ? get a 10th gen processor I would recommend it. Also be sure check Dell outlet for a machine as well as they are usually significantly cheaper there than new. do that also be sure do a chat a rep and ask for a better price as they almost certainly take 5-10% off what is listed.,0.05,0.783,0.167,0.9762,1
gqk53g,Dell,I think that consider your use case here. 're not a gamer and 're not doing any GPU heavy tasks like video editing or machine learning then a GPU not be doing much for . For a basic use case browsing Internet word processing videos a CPU 8gb RAM and a solid state drive would be fine no GPU solid state drive biggest performance difference here . You probably wouldn't spend much more than a few of hundred. In terms of latest features I'm not sure what but desktops tend be expandable and it strikes me that there aren't really any latest features aside from solid state drive and maybe a nice screen that much difference . All that said there are no guarantees any PC last 10 years let alone 15. 're feeling frugal best thing do would probably be buy a cheaper desktop now for half money and another when several years down line.,0.072,0.811,0.117,0.7406,1

I really don't miss adventure of having find a distro where everything works or at least one that I have tweak just one or two things in order have a fully functional laptop. And one thing that I've never seen done properly Linux is sleep state. With my current Mac I don't remember last time I shut it down and everything just works perfectly.

gqdzlc,Dell,For a spec of a similar XPS 15 XPS 17 be about 200 more expensive. Two benefits of XPS 17 are fact that it has vapor chambers for cooling and an optional RTX 2060 graphics card. With that said video editing tends be more CPU intensive than GPU intensive so I personally bought XPS 15 10875 processor and I'll end up putting either 32GB or 64GB of RAM in mine when it gets here.

gqdv0a,Dell,I recently got a g7 7590 that had better hardware than yours but same issues fps. I've built desktops for years so I had a bunch of monitoring apps troubleshoot. My laptop was reaching 100C during bootup so anytime a program would run there was extreme thermal throttling and power throttling. You get realtemp 3.70 and run realtempgt for temps. Look up how run an elevated command prompt get it start windows. Also go get Intel XTU and run benchmark quickly. show whether have thermal or power throttling. Hwinfo64 is another good monitoring app that reads way more sensors than necessary. What check that though is what peaks and where your processor clocks stop and your gpu clocks stop. For example when run gta 5 computer hits 100c before max performance it thermal throttle dells proprietary software try and keep temps down but it doesn't work as intended because fans take too long run. have a major overheating problem then start a chat Dell do a remote session and show them temps by opening up a program. that's case it's either a hardware issue or bad thermal paste application at factory.

gq19uf,Dell,it helps I’m also in same situation and in Canada. I also bought new XPS 15 a week ago second lowest spec. I did have a few coupons like 100 of a purchase of 2000 and a 15% coupon. One thing I don’t like is that spec I chose comes only 8gb ram and 256gb storage whereas old XPS 15 ’d get more than that for less. I’m sure could get a decent discount 10% student discount although when I tried it said were out of codes. I’d also heavily recommend using dell chat feature when buying I was offered 100 off when I negotiated them but I’m sure get more of a discount stress that ’re a student and are stretching your budget get this laptop. I’ve also heard there might be a Memorial Day sale? Not sure. Speaking of model I was considered old one as well but things like aspect ratio and smaller size drew me new one.

gq19uf,Dell,Advice of experience try save a bit more and get new one.

Dell also constantly has site wide discounts and buy laptop by contacting a sales agent they get an additional 4% just ask them what’s best price that they give since ’re on a tight budget. improved display ratio keyboard and especially trackpad have an important impact on usability.,0.0,0.815,0.185,0.9524,1

gq19uf,Dell,I own 2019 model of XPS 15 i7 and 1650 16GB RAM which I upgraded from 8GB and FHD non-touch display. And I'll list out things that 'd have went 2020 models. Better thermals/performance 're not planning on playing video games then don't have worry about this or demanding tasks. But do plan on playing video games 2020 model would better since it has better thermals and a little bit better chipset. But main advantage is better thermals. You still game on 2019 model it just get warmer and throttle at certain situations such as newer AAA titles. You're fine older or lighter games. Audio Gonna be honest speakers on 2019 ones are pretty bad. From reviews that I've seen 2020 ones are really promising. Display/design You'll do fine display of 2019 model. But 16 10 does look really sweet along gigantic trackpad. But on other side 're going lose some valuable ports. Windows hello facial recognition is a good bonus. I were in 2019 about buy new XPS 15 but I also knew that 2020 model would be a major redesign I would've waited another year and just stick my old laptop for another year. I don't know how much manage your current laptop but a year from now XPS would be a lot cheaper and Dell comes up a new laptop I doubt that it be much different from this years model.

gpujho,Dell,first and main thing is just enjoy it. I have two one for myself and one for my wife and they work without issues. Some people have problems and that is same for any brand. have issues look around for a solution or ask for help. A common thing I hear is do a clean installation of Windows. Although that might help some issues it certainly is not required. You have find all drivers etc etc and that is not always easy are not technical. I would suggest run Dell Update get latest drivers Windows update and that is about it. only setting I would recommend changing is Thermal Management in Dell Power Management and set it Quiet.

gpxqgy,Dell,Why are asking all of this after having bought laptop already? I just don't it run extremely hot Laptops are designed run hot. A laptop being hot isn't a bad thing it's doing exactly what it is intended running as fast as possible up designated thermal limit. There is no product-life-threatening aspect of it running hot. Will it run hotter cover vents your legs while playing a game? yes. duh. But run it hot all day and that won't do anything adverse your device. I've probably logged over 400 hours on my 9570 doing 4k-video rendering where it's run flat-out for dozens of hours at a time. Nothing happens. I'm also wondering about portability You easily find out dimensions of what bought by looking online. Why didn't do this before buying it? XPS is designed be a portable and powerful laptop. 's not a gaming laptop those are far less portable. Is it a laptop? Yes. 's very portable. I've heard that these tend suffer from not best thermals and some throttling Why does this matter ? throttles under heavy load. So what? it's not going throttle while browsing watching movies or audio engineering. Will it throttle play a AAA game that absolutely maxes out computer? Yes. 's going run right up limit. As intended. Overwatch and Sims it play no problem at all. play Rise of Tomb Raider 1080p at 50fps. play Far Cry 4 5. play most AAA games from a few years ago. ,0.064,0.807,0.129,0.9198,1
gpxqgy,Dell,Gaming shouldn't be an issue it'll get hot but that's every computer. 'll get a tad warm at most when doing simple web browsing.

gpl2ma,Dell,That website is incorrect. Quadro RTX 3000 has equally as many shaders as does GeForce RTX 2060 in fact they are exactly same card I owned Quadro RTX 3000 albeit in thicker and heavier Precision 7530 here are some benchmarks vis-à-vis Quadro P3200 same card as notebook GTX 1060 mobile and Quadro RTX 5000 same card as desktop RTX 2080 SUPER . Open three orange spoilers for actual results. In fact Quadro RTX 3000 and 5000 perform worse than they're supposed because of neutered power limit compared desktop cards. RTX 5000 I currently own has 3072 shaders and 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM but 80 W power limit means it performs like a desktop RTX 2060 SUPER achieving little more than 18000 in Fire Strike Graphics. desktop RTX 5000 has as many shaders and as much VRAM and runs at a whopping 265 W TGP and destroys RTX 2080 in benchmarks. To answer your other questions Programming robot simulations lil' gaming and a lil' machine learning majority I do in cloud . This is precisely my use case. I run CUDA simulations write OpenGL D3D12 projects and am getting into 3D modelling rendering and ray-tracing too. I also play my fair share of games. AC Odyssey runs at high settings 60 FPS 1080p Witcher 3 runs at ultra settings 60-70 FPS 1080p Shadow of Tomb Raider runs at 50-60 FPS Ultra settings 1080p Control before DLSS 2.0 runs at high settings no ray-tracing at 45-60 FPS 1080p Kingdom Come Deliverance runs at high settings 45-60 FPS 1080p. This is a variety of games I am currently playing. Overall games are certainly playable at higher FPS turn down some settings and accept quality drop. I wouldn't buy Precisions just for Quadro but rather for incredible business-class customer support sure get ProSupport Plus Accidental Damage for 3 years at least and generally better QC and QA than XPS. They're exactly same chassis but Precision name is more important Dell. That said are bent on getting a 17 machine high performance why not get 7750 instead?

gpl2ma,Dell,Considering 'll be equally thermally constrained in both setups I doubt see much of a performance gain from Quadro RTX 3000 Mobile . all depends on how well Dell has tuned these GPUs as it's highly unlikely that be able hit 80W on GPU as well as 35-100W on CPU without crashing limits of cooling.,0.067,0.803,0.13,0.5719,1
gpl2ma,Dell,rtx 2060 and quadro rtx 3000 are same core TU106 quadro does not have more shaders or pipelines i'm not sure where got that info from. They are going perform nearly identically I would say how nvidia's boost works. Also killer 1650 is just a rebranded intel chipset it likely works good in linux killer no longer uses qualcomm for their wifi6 generation. Even then just buy an AX200/201 intel card for 20 really that instead. Just get XPS 17 precision has no advantages for your use case,0.148,0.772,0.08,-0.7822,-1

gpn6sv,Dell,Well...I hope 're trying other means bring down heat by placing laptop in such a way that allows proper ventilation. They are just basic things which I have tried but still didn't help my overheating issue. I have contacted customer service and I haven't got part where they asked me service yet..so seeing your situation..idk that would work out too. Just got a message that since I bought my laptop from USA and now I'm in India international warranty won't apply.. know anything about checking that...Lemme know other things customer service helped me is how we disable turboboost of processor from BIOS setup. That did help in maintaining temperature. gameplay won't be affected that much and I read elsewhere that it's actually better for it be disabled but do read about those things on your own. I feel that I shouldn't have pay extra for an i7 9750H when I'm not going use it it's full capacity...so I asked them fix issue in some other way...that's when I got message about international warranty. 's definitely a good solution and help get through days till get a proper solution from dell. I feel we buy a laptop we expect things advertised so try talking them about it...,0.041,0.854,0.105,0.9109,1
gphpdx,Dell,What I would do is find out how much battery wear is. I have BatteryBar and it displays it in their program all time. battery wear is high may just have a faulty battery replacing battery a new OEM one be an easy fix there isn't much battery wear it could be something else.,0.043,0.902,0.055,0.1531,1
gphpdx,Dell,Unfortunately battery life on 7390 is terrible. one thing that is majorly flawed. You’ll have be extremely conservative and maybe sacrifices have anything near average battery life on one single full charge. I wish I could offer a solution your problem because I certainly searched for it every possible way. But as said continue play dell power management tool optimize your laptop. Mix a little undervolting in there ’ll like too.,0.102,0.706,0.192,0.743,1
gphpdx,Dell,I have same model and 3 hours is too little. I get 5-6 moderate use meaning things like listening music browsing web note taking and reading. This is also Better battery setting. I don't know too much about what cause these kinds of issues but sometimes there are programs and services running in background that are draining battery. You might explore this possibility haven't already. Also check sure 're using default Balanced power plan in Windows and that Thermal Management is set Optimized in Dell Power Manager.,0.0,0.881,0.119,0.8641,1
gphpdx,Dell,seems battery life widely varies per person. Mine was definitely 5-6 hours when new FHD I cannot imagine getting same 4k version so 3 4 hours seems about accurate in case we use our laptops similarly. ThrottleStop and Dells Power Management features definitely help extend battery life a little however. Unfortunately my battery health just degraded in a weeks time 32% and battery life has been 3 hours max now after 5 months of usage . I am so disappointed.. Dells support is looking into it now but their first support agent said this was 'normal'.,0.036,0.829,0.135,0.8109,1
gphpdx,Dell,You battery life is terrible ! I previously had 4K version and I agree battery life is bad 5 ish hours . Run sleep study report after a sleep session see exactly laptop was idle. Also try undervolt it helps battery life and performance. Also check that are not in max performance mode in dell power manager for battery life go in quiet mode . You should also check do not have any background apps that are active when using your laptop maybe something is taking some of your CPU usage. I now have FHD model and battery is way better around 7-8 hours for same usage however i do notice slight screen difference but get used it after couple of days. i would suggest swapping for a FHD model buy and sell yours on ebay might a small profit out of it I do not regret at all my decision.,0.029,0.874,0.097,0.8477,1

Many enterprises I know rely on it for end user machines without issue. Macafees ok but its another program and its not as optimized or integrated w/ OS. Malwarebytes recommendation below is also good supplement. As for torrent probably fine. 're concerned I'd take advantage of one of semi virtualization options in Windows. You could set up WSL and export an image a torrent client and then delete and re-import it as necessary. Windows sandbox is a good option here. Or go as far as setting up a complete VM on Hyper-V for full isolation As for phone discussion for and other poster suggest checking out Microsoft's Your Phone program haven't already.

gp6srg,Dell,Your title and wattage question is one thing. Not charging past 70% is something completely different. Either way regarding both wattage question and not charging past 70% answer is absolutely not . While slower charge cycles may help maintain your battery health still MUST USE THE POWER ADAPTER THAT YOUR SYSTEM REQUIRES . wattage is not only required for charging. ’s for running rest of your system CPU RAM graphics display etc. Do not use a lower wattage power adapter. Long answer Always fully charge your battery whenever plug it in. Never partially charge battery. When do plug it in charge wait until battery is fully charged before unplugging charger and using system on battery power again. Never use “express” or “fast” charge options in BIOS or in Windows. Always use slowest charge method that is available. Faster charge cycles wear a battery out quicker. battery is easily removable removing it entirely once it is fully charged while system is plugged and turned on keep battery from wearing. Systems pull power from both battery and AC power simultaneously while system is running hint this happens when use aftermarket or undersized power adapters so your best bet is simply disconnect battery or turn off charging this is at all possible. Most systems have a battery charge disable option. Do some research on how disable battery charging. do charge battery don’t do it while are using system. ’s always best charge battery whenever system is not in use so try not use system while battery is charging. use system remove battery or disable charging . Try wait until battery has discharged at least 20% before recharging it. Short charge/discharge cycles quickly wear out battery. ’s actually better fully discharge your battery before charging it again avoid those short discharge/charge cycles. You should also calibrate your battery once a month for heavy battery users or every other month use battery less often. Follow this link for detailed instructions on how properly calibrate your battery. As see proper battery charging techniques is only one step of many when it comes battery maintenance and maximizing performance. However please use adapter that your system shipped and do not use a lower wattage or aftermarket adapter or run risk of not only destroying your battery but also burning adapter and catching a fire. Simply don’t do it. And while we’re on subject of aftermarket power adapters let me say repeat do not use aftermarket or undersized power adapters or they turn your battery into an spicypillows,0.022,0.937,0.041,0.7299,1

I remember that after a clean install of Windows from a Microsoft iso I allowed OS install all updates from App Store plus I installed drivers suggested by Dell Update app together newest firmware mind undervolting issues though . I once for giggles went Display Settings and enabled two HDR options for both displays streaming and something else . worked LG OSD confirmed it was now working in HDR mode but image quality was so poor and colors were so washed out and uncalibrated that I never bothered enable it again and soon after I installed Linux.

gouygs,Dell,They look pretty much same me. They have identical service manual images. I think Vostro might have better support or something since it's geared towards small businesses instead of regular consumers. Also I think colors are different - Inspiron has a white logo instead of a black one on Vostro and textures might be different? Typically small business laptops are slightly better built than consumer laptops but I'm not sure this is case for Vostro vs. Inspiron and I know many of Vostro models are same as Inspirons. don't see any differences in spec sheet and support is same they're probably pretty much same i.e. no differences in RAM CPU etc - just get whichever one is cheaper.

gotro5,Dell,most concerning points are battery drain and text appearance.

About text on a 27 in monitor clearly see difference in 1080p from that on a higher resolution screen. On win10 1080p on a 2k or higher res screen aka downsampling looks worse and text looks a lot more blurred than on an original 1080p screen due its rendering approach.

However get really used FHD and I think trade off for battery life is so much worth it. never had a 4K display before go for FHD. battery life is a concern go for FHD.

gop9jd,Dell,I had this problem and others relating BIOS . Did it attempt a BIOS update right before this started happening?

Let computer sit in this hung state for 1-2 hours. Mine actually took that long do whatever tf it needed do finish then it started normally. 3. As another poster said try resetting BIOS default and then don't touch em. Defaults seems be only settings they actually test be working because ordinary custom settings would create long hangs on a variety of operations. 4. You try other versions of BIOS including earlier than what have but beware Dell Command Update utility trying patch it back version 're having problem and then more hangs .

goja64,Dell,'re talking about black carbon fiber vs white glass fiber here's my thoughts. I have white glass fiber. feels like a textured hard plastic smooth but feel weave. Reports say it stays surprisingly clean for being white. Fingerprints are not visible at all as far as I tell. backlight however white keys difficult see in certain lighting. I have not used black carbon fiber but what I've read is that it's a more rubberized texture and it show fingerprints and oils. Overall I'm happy my white glass fiber version.,0.046,0.792,0.162,0.9072,1

goja64,Dell,I once had a silver Samsung laptop silver key caps and every time backlight came on it was nearly useless because couldn’t see lettering or lights because backlight and keys were close same color. Everything else I loved about laptop but they key color made me hate it. I eventually found a keyboard on eBay from a later model that had dark grey keys bought it for 35 and spent 2 hours carefully replacing key caps dark ones. After that it was perfect. entire keyboard assembly should have been easier replace than key apps but it was somehow riveted/glued other components that made removing it very difficult.

gnspk7,Dell,Significantly better screen and brightness. And this might sound stupid but 'd be surprised how many people care a lot about this - LOOKS. sleek metallic clean finish matters a lot these days. Also significantly thinner bezels. XPS 15 also comes a 1650 Ti which is better than a 1650 Max Q in ThinkPad and 10th gen Intel processors compared 9th gen of ThinkPad,0.031,0.703,0.266,0.9408,1
gnspk7,Dell,I'm a big XPS hater here due a mediocre experience 9570's QC and bad product design but objectively speaking there are solid tradeoffs while an updated X1E doesn't release. Major two points for XPS would be 10th gen H series CPUs 45W 8-core options and 16 10 bezel-less form factor. Other than that there are a lot more good and bad things. For good touchpad is huge and best-in-class class being not a Mac probably much better speakers finally but still no Macs dual M.2 not sure on 15 . Also that dual Thunderbolt3 and right-side usb-c DP and PD not a typo . Also eGPUs should be really nice on 10th gen. For bad 't get it in black Precision-line exclusive again metal frame makes it heavy despite smaller profile Wifi NIC is now soldered it didn't get significantly upgraded thermals like 17's vapor chamber and worst of worst vs a Thinkpad - keyboard experience be a downgrade may not cope . Oh and pricing so far seems pretty stupid but then again so is Thinkpad's X1 line. And 'll have buy some legacy port adapters but well it's that Macbook-induced future now and I don't hate this change. As for X1E there are probably promos since it's been out for a while it still has a trackpoint use it and that KILLER keyboard it's black and sleek-looking and materials it feel exactly amount of light and rigid a laptop should be too much density makes laptops more fragile and harder carry in hand . Screen has nice options particularly for pros who work under strong daylight or privacy guard. I also personally believe QC and support are still better on Lenovo but that varies by region and of course how relevant are for their reps individual vs large business purchase... . For bad well everything not good from Dell and likely price. But then again Thinkpads actually sell REALLY WELL and expensive 2-4y after launch not something say for 1.3k fully loaded 9560/70's original price double that on ebay refurb warranty and all.

gnspk7,Dell,I'm looking upgrade my Thinkpad X1 Carbon 5th gen. Ive realized that I'm using my laptop more and more and an Ultrabook is simply not able cope workload I throw at it. I'm curious about what workloads your X1C isn't dealing and they're anything more than CPU limitations. My wife's laptop is a 5th gen X1C and my only real complaint about it is that it's only a dual core solved in Gen6 and later and lack of an moderately powerful GPU. Gen7 and Gen8 X1C are pretty much indistinguishable other than some vPro-style enterprise features since Gen8 won't be getting Ice Lake. TBH that's only deal breaker for me. X1C is perfect size and weight 14 display is big enough but not too big SSDs are fast enough battery life is outstanding hardware is solid port selection is great trackpad is as good as ones on my Surface and pretty close ones on MacBooks I've had. I just more GPU power than I get UHD 620. Ice Lake would do it. Ryzen 4000 would do it. Sadly it seems X1C is getting neither this year. XPS13 first caught my eye since it has Ice Lake but slightly smaller screen at 16 10 is a bit of a turnoff. XPS15 looks much better and is barely larger than an X1C though much heavier. flip side is buy it at 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD and then upgrade it yourself save a lot of money. Anyway I ramble.,0.026,0.829,0.145,0.9861,1

gni5ad,Dell,I know cards some degree do share load I've always assumed my discrete graphics focused on heavier 3D lifting while integrated handled more of Windows Aero / Explorer load. That being said should see discrete card taking number crunching on. for some reason it isn't I think might sure that necessary configuration is made have system prefer that card. I'm not sure of verbiage on an ATI model as I have a NVIDIA card in all of my various systems. In NVIDIA it's something effect of Prefer High Performance Processor . Another possibility is thermal throttling occurring which should be able determine by getting Intel XTU and monitoring your card during gameplay. For me I had undervolt my Dell XPS 15 some degree for more stable performance. Additionally and this may be contentious I disable TurboBoost in BIOS. I find short burst of performance overpowers thermals on my Dell XPS and I'd rather have a steady clock speed and predictable thermal variables. Finally I found that I often had better performance using Dell drivers for video card. I know that is also somewhat sacrosanct in PC world and I don't do same thing on my Dell G5 gaming PC or on a Dell XPS or Alienware tower. For whatever reason I see better more predictable performance on my Dell XPS Dell provided ones. They seem update enough that I don't feel left behind and I run into far less problems. YMMV.

gmp6vs,Dell,I have both a Macbook Pro and an XPS and I prefer carbon fiber on XPS. looks great imo. While all-aluminium design on Macbook also looks great but it's cold touch and feels slippery. My palms after shift while I'm typing on Macbook and I've never had that problem while typing on XPS. Macbook excels in two main places trackpad and speakers. I have butterfly keyboard model so I 't comment on new Magic Keyboard . trackpad is great it's large and it has a satisfying click that's not too obnoxious. trackpad on XPS is great for a Windows machine. Compared Macbook it's good but not great. 's a little too small for my liking and click is a little too loud for me. speakers on Macbook are phenomenal. XPS pales in comparison it just sounds worse. thing is I almost never use speakers. I have earbuds that I just plug and play. only time I would ever use my speakers was I was in a presentation and I needed play a video an audience - XPS speakers are decent enough. Some might say but Macbook build quality is SO much better than XPS . There is 0 chassis flex on either machine both feel rigid and sturdy - something a 1000 laptop should feel like. How about webcam! nosecam is god-awful on XPS XPS has a nosecam but it also has Windows Hello and in my experience Hello works flawlessly webcam is at bottom of screen. I use my laptop far away enough so that nosecam isn't a nosecam but more like a chincam which still see my face - perfectly acceptable for any conference call. Macbooks don't get viruses and are long-lasting machines that have 0 problems! Look at my comment below about QC control on XPS lineup. As for no-viruses a recent study by malwarebytes one of world's leading antimalware company found that MacOS has more viruses than Windows As for Windows gets viruses take a look at this Windows Defender is awesome and after using Windows machines for over 4 years I've had 0 malware/virus issues after pirating/torrenting on sketchy sites. Windows Update has never updated without my permission when it's a urgent security update. People forget there's a simple setting turn off automatic updates. Because I don't rant more and I ran out of time XPS lineup is on par Macbook. prefer MacOS know what do. prefer Windows also know what do. Both are excellent machines and I'm sure 'll do just fine go either of them.,0.025,0.761,0.213,0.9982,1

gn3l83,Dell,Indesign in particular makes it sound like 're doing lots of visual work that lots of people are going be seeing e.g customer facing maybe stuff for print. So I'm going second Lordship Mern's recommendation of UP2716D which notably gives full aRGB/NTSC coverage and much better DCI-P3 coverage. USB-C doesn't matter for XPS 15 since 't charge laptop properly any monitor so just use a 10 USB-C dongle problem solved . we're just comparing P2720DC and U2719DC... Hmmm. Honestly no meaningful difference except that U series supports Daisy Chain which could be handy ever a second FHD or QHD monitor. P2720DC is overall very nice. Out of box it'll give 100% sRGB/72% NTSC at 6500K 2 dE. This is very good and calibration beyond this point not matter. U2719DC does not offer meaningful color advantages. Also U and P series have similarly high quality standards same warranties 3 year advanced exchange same dead pixel guarantees etc. P series is Dell's primary line of business monitors. In this market reliability is a very high priority . No difference here. But again your described use case I would recommend a wide gamut monitor like UP2716D over either of these choices.,0.065,0.779,0.157,0.9557,1

gn3l83,Dell,Thank all for your comments and recommendations! How come P2720DC cannot support daisy chaining? That's important for me as well since I'm eventually have another monitor. Also what usb-c dongle do recommend so that it charge my xps at same time?,0.047,0.753,0.2,0.7426,1

gmx5ps,Dell,battery is degrading work Dell support. that's not it... Based on my fans also seem be running louder and more often I'm suspicious of some rogue application loading up your CPU all time. Open your task manager when machine should be idle but fans are running and identify process that's using most CPU. Regarding CPU usage under 10% 10% is measured against clock speed of your CPU. CPU is running full-tilt all time then that at a 10% load indicates something is using CPU when it should be idle which would drain battery fast.

gmh26m,Dell,This means system during post cannot figure out what Charger is plugged in and adjust how it powers your system. system try and use charger but it usually not charge battery at all in this state it uses power adapter at all just tell system continue and that let it boot OS and what happens then is hoping it works fine. I would disconnect your charger from your computer and from wall outlet check charger for any damage anywhere. Move a different wall outlet. Make sure it’s a dell charger that is at least 45 watts. You may do a bios update also but that needs a good charger do so on dell systems. ’s possible charger itself has gone bad or a connection on motherboard/ within charging circuit has failed. chargers tend be pretty tough I’ve seen dell chargers that are 10 years old still working in an office people traveling.,0.09,0.809,0.1,0.1901,1

How’d like screen size of your old mbp? feel like 13 inches was enough then that’d be a factor. Also consider portability since mentioned ’re a college student XPS 13 would be really portable. You might be fine 15’s weight but going from class class it might a difference. Another option could be get XPS 13 and get an eGPU extra money? More gaming performance same slim package.

gmmuth,Dell,Are prices really that close in Europe? A decent mbp 16 in us is over 3k but I configure a pretty solid xps 15 9500 for under 2 500. I’m trying same decision but I’m also considering xps 17. A couple things that are still making me lean towards xps are discounts get at least here in US—a 10% off coupon another 100 off for dell financing plus cash back through rakuten. And save money by upgrading parts of xps later. I do 16gb ram and 512gb ssd and upgrade them later myself I end up needing more. For mbp think MIGHT certain storage or specs buy it that way because ’t upgrade it yourself. And Apple is charging a truckload for those upgrades 400 extra get 32gb ram instead of 16... seriously? Dell charges 147 for this. Edit Totally worth it over 13. You should get way better performance out of 15 especially dedicated gpu.,0.028,0.826,0.146,0.9678,1
gmmuth,Dell,In my case I 't decide between XPS 15 and waiting for XPS 17... but since there are no actual reviews yet I'll wait. Especially now that I've seen how long wait is. Why not go for FHD version? That would save 400 Euros pre-discount without losing out on performance and gaining some battery life as well. Can someone weigh in on how much actually get out of a 4k screen for a 15 inch laptop?

Take me as a complete noob. I just read a bunch of articles and forums on this problem so yeah. One Youtuber had this same problem and he used Thermal Grizzle Conductonaut for CPU and Arctic MX4 for GPU because on GPU liquid metal didnt work well he said? Other forums said update bios and some tips and tricks but none of them were as bad as this. This laptop cost me a bomb but it shouldnt overheat like one. Thanks anyone give me advice.

gmcdws,Dell,Limit your framerate something sensible in CS. This stops your GPU working too hard. In console type fps max 60. From memory have do it on every start up but maybe that has changed. I guess also do this via nvidia control panel these days. Also get Throttlestop and create a profile for gaming Turbo boost set off. You'll get a lower peak clock speed but produce much less heat.

Watch Bob of all trades video on YouTube. 5. mount it on a laptop cooling pad or just get so.me airflow going in.

gm7ht1,Dell,I agree GoSitInTheTruck that Precision line 3540 5540 7540 is what 'd be interested in. Of 15 in 35xx line only goes up 32 gb ram 5540 goes up 64 gb ram 7540 goes up 128 gb ram big differences between these two are portability sustained performance and upgrades 5540 is smaller and lighter but that means that although it pack similar components as 7540 it overheats much more quickly and severely throttle performance in sustained hours processing. Because 7540 is bigger and has a better cooling setup maxed configurations do have more powerful silicon inside. A few more notes • new line of xps is announced and all that there is a new line of precisions in works but not out yet. •You mentioned tight budget - either look at refurbished Dell has superb quality control for refurbished products or look into price matching system look up other computers same specs find one that price match . • 're doing lots of heavy computing it's sustained over a long time or gpu-heavy then I'd suggest 7540.

glj4c8,Dell,Hello for information which computer? x200B Never keep standard battery charge parameters in BIOS modify them avoid a too deep discharge and a too high load. worst is when are on mains and parameters ins BIOS or Setup require that always charge battery. My parameters in BIOS or Setup because I am under Linux are never charge more than 85% and charge battery only from 50% of SOC on mains see also parameter critical charge action in Windows or Linux and set this parameter 15 or 20% of remaining SOC State of Charge in order avoid producing lithium dendrites which irreparably destroy battery slowly very slowly but definitively. From time time every 4-6 months change parameters obtain a full charge at 90-95% never 100% and discharge battery up threshold of 15-20% SOC depending on settings calibrate inevitable wear of Li-Ion battery in battery manager. Avoid use Rapid Charge too often. OK we have a battery that have a range of use of only 20% 85% on battery but it last longer except construction defect . My parameters mean that on mains as long as battery is not below 85% it never charges I plug in main AC LED charge indicator turns on but stops and it does charge it charges but stops at 85% max. I install lithium battery systems LFP or LiFePO4 technology and charge systems solar panels alternators and shore for sailing boats I know problem well LFP are more safe. For ThinkPad Lenovo and I believe HP charge is optimized in this way which means that batteries wear out much less quickly but computer seems not be able last longer on battery since range of use is less important.

glofhg,Dell,I have been using my XPS 13 9300 for almost 2 weeks now and complaints are always over-dramatic. There are no issues that I have noticed aside from some random stuff that almost every laptop has. really in-depth overview of things that someone might find annoying here is a list laptop get pretty loud doing anything graphics intensive but there is no whining sound it just sounds like smaller fans spinning really fast. get fairly hot your running anything graphics intensive after around 20 minutes. But remember this laptop is super thin and very light so it is be expected. are planning game on this frequently though I would not get any kind of ultrabook. your not planning on running graphics too much then this laptop remains pretty cool and dell has optimized this laptop have excellent battery life. I go about 8-10 hours without needing charge. Random Wi-Fi disconnects maybe once a day Screen Flashes something do auto-refresh I believe this is not a bad thing but it bothers some people Average quality speakers but definitely not bad they work just fine for most normal media consumption Software stuff implemented by Dell that I believe is related battery life. Dell Power Manager that's installed seems change speeds a little but tell this laptops power is being throttled a bit for sake of battery life. You install a fresh version of Windows that may fix this but I didn't and don't think it's necessary Other than that stuff this laptop while a bit pricey is definitely gorgeously designed and is pretty much exactly what I thought it was going be. is probably smallest 13 ultrabook but nice 16 10 aspect ratio and borderless display this laptop feel around a 14in while being crazy light and portable.,0.048,0.773,0.179,0.9938,1
glofhg,Dell,search this forum and also DellXPS notice 2 issues that many people are complaining about first major 2nd minor TB3 not working properly especially when trying connect external monitor under Ubuntu screen goes blank for a 1-2s on some events Furthermore several people pointed that following components are working but could be better quality webcam speakers Finally as all XPS 13 laptops and macbooks and probably many others that matter it 't operate at maximum CPU frequency for more than few minutes which makes name XPS eXtreme Performance System sound a bit like a grotesque... . After that it throttle down CPU stay cool. This is an obvious misdesign of cooling system Lenvovo Thinkpads operate for days on full throttle without getting close get hot but they have laughably little amount of RAM OTOH I'm considering purchasing this laptop also but I definitely wait for TB3 issue be resolved specifically I'm waiting for Plugable announce 9300 be compatible their TBT3-UDV dock Other than this it really depends what are going use this laptop for but comparing other brands it has IMO outstanding quality specs /price ratio in 13 category it is only 13 laptop reasonably small display bezel reasonable amount of RAM although 64GB would be better TB3 support when they fix it duh... official Linux support and reasonable international warranty support I currently own 9360 model and often move between various South-East Asian countries and so far always managed get Dell engineer come fix whatever problems I had just waiting for parts arrive was taking long ,0.018,0.841,0.142,0.9879,1

glv0yi,Dell,I think a better comparison would be between XPS and X1 Extreme Gen2. While similar Extreme is for power-hungry users whereas P1 is for professionals as its hardware e.g. graphics card is not geared towards gaming but rather is optimised work software like AutoCAD and Solidworks. care about screen OLED of Extreme is significantly brighter than P1. You look more into them care. Now as far as XPS i9 goes... You'd be avoiding all heating bills in winter but would be giving up your laptop. Seeing thermal issues of XPS lineup I would not trust it i9 undervolting and repasting. I've heard similar thermal issues on Lenovo's side though so sure do some digging in each subreddit see there are many thermal issues your chose processor .

However keep in mind that size of objects in a native 1080p Windows environment is perfectly rendered a 100% scale factor and matte treatment makes everything smooth for daily use.

You'll eventually thermally throttle but it shouldn't be at 56C. You'll undervolt. You try reloading defaults in BIOS but that didn't work for me. Most are downgrading 1.8.0 but use information in find CFG Lock offset and re-enable undervolting on latest BIOS. CFG Lock is offset 0x5C3 save some work. Once have undervolting enabled click TPL button in ThrottleStop and uncheck Clamp then go into FIVR and check Disable and Lock Turbo Power Limits. This keep system from lowering PL1 on .

glpfaz,Dell,I'd go a Lenovo Yoga C940 - they're offered in 15 and 14 models use AES 2.0 digitizers generally preferred over MPP digitizers in Spectre line and have much more modern specs than XPS 15 2-in-1 which also isn't set get an update anytime soon . My C940 14 does really well in Sketchbook and Krita and find built-in pen a bit small it's roughly pencil-sized 're more used that then there's a lot of other options for it check out stylus under AES 2.0 heading in wiki see what work . 14 has one of new Ice Lake chips which be great for lighter gaming Minecraft older AAA stuff or indies maybe not ARMA 3 and my UHD model gets me around 8 hours of battery life pretty easily. 15 has a more powerful processor and dedicated graphics so it'll be better at gaming but battery is same size for more power-hungry component so longer battery life is your priority 14 might be a better pick. Both 14 and 15 models have Thunderbolt 3 ports though so could go for 14 and add an external GPU later extra horsepower. As far as how they compare a Wacom tab generally they'll have a bit more wobble on diagonal lines especially slow ones a higher initial activation force though it's still pretty good compared MPP and in general feel a bit less like working on paper or canvas - kinda have learn system and its issues and work it as opposed just doing what and it coming out no issues. 's a pretty great compromise compared having a laptop or desktop and a separate tablet though because take it anywhere - I had some work for classes that required a visit Met so I took all my notes some sketches and a quick map by hand on my laptop.,0.009,0.853,0.138,0.9905,1

Dell lock people out of fan control and force people use a horrible piece of Dell bloatware control their fans. I have mine set quiet right now and it's producing more noise at idle than other laptops I've owned have at full load. This is while temps are only at 55 C ! Edit this was also at better performance instead of best performance. 2GHz instead of 4... Performing basic tasks such browsing web/email pushes CPU temp 99 C. Simply try play a Youtube video and it gets worse. I'm stuck this machine and so I've been thinking about opening it up and repasting it etc. But I never buy a Dell machine again. This is a universal issue XPS line there is no solution it regardless of what their braindead support people say. They completely redesign their cooling solution and they let people customise/control it.

glecri,Dell,Likely samsung wouldnt play ball and them a custom panel or it was too expensive too. Maybe it was an engineering issue as they'd likely have a custom production line just for this panel and wasn't worth effort or yields weren't right. Oled in screens bigger than a smartphone has provem have alot of issues scaling. I think we see a return of oled in some shape or form but given apple is looking at micro led backlit panels that offer oled like black levels and much higher brightness levels its possible dell go this route. Oled on a laptop just has too many burn in issues cost and longevity. I feel its a bit of a dead end display technology as much as I like it.,0.068,0.856,0.076,0.273,1
glecri,Dell,Yeah I also wanted an OLED version. Haven't seen OLED on a laptop personally but have seen it on Samsung smartphones and heard about it on YT reviews. As others have mentioned in other threads no manufacturer currently manufactures 16 10 OLEDs.,0.066,0.896,0.038,-0.296,-1
glecri,Dell,There isn't a 16 10 OLED panel yet. x200B I own XPS 15 7590 4K OLED and it's really such a beautiful screen. I often watch 4K movies on it do not anything else anymore.,0.0,0.878,0.122,0.6344,1
glecri,Dell,Here's my take. I got 7590 OLED last week a day before release of 9500. Knowing that OLED isn't available yet? in 16 10 has made that pill a whole lot easier swallow. Now that I've seen what OLED offers going UHD 16 10 is simply not enticing especially at price of upgrade . I got my 7590 for 1 030 CAD less than 9500 see relevant specs below . Right now dividends of an upgrade are simply not there for me. Maybe in a couple of years when 17 XPS becomes more affordable and they iron out what I only assume be kinks in this new machine that prospect be much more enticing? In any case for now drools over 7590 beast!

glecri,Dell,I believe that all OLED laptops - HP Dell Gigabyte etc. are all same 15 panel from Samsung.

glklh3,Dell,Not worth it... Get 1080p do just fine. I think get better 4k experience on TV or monitor on desktop due battery life and HDR and setting whatnot. Other than watch movie in 4k doesn't really use 4k for anything else. image is more vivid but not worth it on laptop. Not all software made for scaling and definitely see flaw easily namely winRar or settings in Control Panel. UWP software scales nicely because of architecture.

glk2y9,Dell,Hi I had 16gb 1tb oled i7 model and sold it a few days ago. I really regretted buying it because of several reasons. had coilwhine which really annoyed me. thermals were just awful after repasting. fans were almost always audible and when doing heavier duty work really loud. case also got very hot. Battery life was subpar oled had screen banding Now be fair I think most laptops that generation of Intel laptops have problems keeping CPU cool. But I spend so much money for a laptop I just 't live so many problems. I'm also a programmer and personally I'm going get new x13 a ryzen cpu when it comes out. may take a while though because those puppies are gonna sell really good.

glhh6h,Dell,audio crackling seems be a perpetual problem Dell. 's result of a number of design decisions. These include - Killer chipset dodgy video drivers poor power management and poor thermals. Undercooling helps turning off turbo boot helps running on mains power helps changing audio drivers helps but... all fixes published only address one of contributing factors so things get better but not perfect. To be fair it's difficult replicate because it depends on network activity graphics activity ambient temperature charging/battery status and how good thermal pasting is but despite promises Dell haven't really tried that hard either or I'm sure they would have fixed it. Maybe there is a cost implication or problem needs affect more people? I finally gave up because audio is really important me sent my new XPS 15 back and bought a MacBook Pro.

Afaik new matte screens don't interfere display's color accuracy sharpness color gamut contrast brightness so that's good. afford it i'd highly suggest uhd config Xps 15 9500 also get a matte screen protector for it search somehwere on ebay amazon or aliexpress. they aren't out yet they be in upcoming weeks. Usually they're very thin 1mm or thinner so tjey won't touch keyboard when close laptop's lid. I'd highly suggest get this combo uhd and matte screen protector .

I use it in stand mode when I'm in bed have some youtube playing on side too which is nice don't really use tent thing too much but it's there have limited space . As far as battery life 9500 has a bigger battery but also has higher-powered components so it's bigger partly compensate for that. 're going 13 I'd say definitely skip UHD screen because it's very much not worth hit your battery - my C940 is 14 and I could barely notice difference vs. FHD one only reason I went for UHD was because that's what was available specs I wanted. I'm not too mad because I still get like 8ish hours of battery life pretty easily latest bios and driver updates but realistically FHD display I'd be hitting 10 hours regularly. I say that 're not set on an XPS get 15 2-in-1s HP Spectre x360 just got a refresh that looks really sweet and it's designed from ground up a UHD screen so it has a 97Wh battery or a 14 like Lenovo Yoga C940 that I have - built as well as a Macbook IMO great screen best audio on a Windows laptop solid keyboard pen built in and good battery life a UHD screen 're set on that . You'll get a bit of extra real estate 're worried that a 13 be too small coming from your Macbook but I'll just say that 14 is about as big a 2-in-1 as I'd be comfortable using - they get heavy they get big and it's just kind of a clunky experience use them as a tablet.,0.022,0.813,0.165,0.9939,1

gkvq18,Dell,Sounds like a botched explanation. Nvidia G-Sync is name of dynamic refresh rate feature. Nvidia PhysX is physics acceleration feature for video games. Nvidia Optimus is feature that switches between internal graphics card Intel GPU and external graphics card Nvidia GPU . They are trying say that G-Sync is dynamically setting refresh rate. part about PhysX is wrong. I have a Dell G5 5590 a 144hz display. does not have dynamic refresh rate G-Sync .

gkvq18,Dell,Are sure your G5 5590 has a 144Hz display? There are models where screen is only 60Hz e.g. one i5-9300H on Dell's site . Yes explanation makes no sense. ChadValijean is right in that Nvidia PhysX has nothing do framerate but I also add that G-Sync or FreesSync does not limit your display's refresh rate in any way. dynamically syncs your monitor's refresh rate a game's FPS eliminate screen tearing. But when 're on your desktop or doing any other sort of tasks your screen should be running at 144Hz. Optimus technology also shouldn't have any impact on your display's refresh rate. That offloads work your iGPU your discrete GPU is not needed so your laptop extend its battery life. Both GPUs should support 144Hz.

gkmmzg,Dell,Yeah looks like your CPU is being thermal throttled hard. SMH 800mhz on CPU. Unplugging battery won't do much because cooling design and Dell's thermal management are inherently flawed. biggest culprit seems be uncooled Mosfet VRMs on top of both CPU and GPU. 's a well known issue among XPS 15 lines that none of paid reviews out there address about it. Undervolting won't help much throttling eventually occur under sustained load. Disabling turbo boost is not a proper solution that's like throwing your money out of window. Dell finally addresses this in new XPS 15 2020 by actually covering Mosfet VRMs under heat sink. Though only through stress test that we tell. I would say once thermal review for new XPS 15/17 comes out should ditch this piece of junk that is XPS 15 9560.

gjyis8,Dell,They're not shady so much as understaffed due what I'm assuming is significant call increases from COVID purchases and outsourced either pre-COVID as a matter of cost savings or more recently as a method of trying keep up call volume . That results in a large number of reps being unqualified script-readers which also makes calls take longer as well as introduces more scrutiny than normal on metrics. Management knows they're underwater and any CSR who is below par get replaced quickly try and bring things up overall. Dropped calls lost sales 's no different than shopping at a local department store and being asked 17 times sign up for a store credit card so save 15% today. They get a small bonus for every signup or sometimes for passing a threshold and get fired they don't hit particular numbers. I don't consider checkout person be shady nor really company as most are upfront employees about what happen them they miss numbers though I do find it distasteful. EDIT On new order number thing there are two possibilities there. First rep did it get their name attached for metrics. As long as there's no cost increase or order delay this shouldn't really matter. Second order was canceled because your payment didn't go though it's entirely possible that system considered it dead and forced a reorder.

gkfdqe,Dell,I think your laptop is basically overheating and switching off is it's way of protecting itself. What i would do i was . A . Send laptop back it's still in warranty or let it be repaired by Dell. B . Open up laptop repaste thermal. Try undervolting CPU a but usually -0.125mv or so use ThrottleStop undervolting does not work try downgrading your BIOS a earlier version. Also using ThrottleStop turn off Turbo Boost yes lose some performance but CPU run a lot cooler and draw less power. Edit Open up laptop repaste CPU new thermal paste.,0.038,0.887,0.075,0.5499,1

gk96mo,Dell,2-in-1 has a soldered ssd. That's a big difference for me.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gk96mo,Dell,7390 2-in-1 came out at end of September and was first of XPS lineup updated build 16 10 display minimal bezels . They changed naming convention that model away from 9XXX numbers 7XXX numbers because they claimed they wanted all of their premium laptops start 7XXX numbers. Then when they launched new XPS 13 9300 they decided change numbers back old naming convention. To answer your question here are differences between 2-in-1 and 9300 7390 2-in-1 has soldered RAM and SSD presumably device thinner 9300 only has soldered RAM SSD is replaceable They both use same 10th-gen Ice Lake processors They both have 16 10 display ratios identical displays including touch They both have similar batteries and similar battery life FHD models have significantly better battery life than UHD displays 7390 2-in-1 has new vapor change cooling system that just looks like a plastic cover placed over heatsinks 9300 does not have new cooling system but reviews says that performance on it still better than 7390 2-in-1 in some benchmarks although it does run hotter. One review said that increased performance may be due updated system settings on 9300 since specs were otherwise same. I personally noticed that my 7390 2-in-1 was faster boot and more responsive after latest Intel UHD drivers and most recent BIOS 9300 has an updated keyboard more key travel than 7390 2-in-1 but they also got rid of separate pg up and pg down keys instead making left and right arrows larger and placing pg up and pg down keys as function activated keys. They both have same trackpad. Obvious but might as well point it out 7390 2-in-1's keyboard be folded back completely and be used as a tablet. ports are identical on both models while 9300 is slightly smaller almost imperceptibly thinner and weighs slightly less. Big difference 9300 has Windows Hello facial recognition support and a better webcam. 7390 2-in-1 has no Windows Hello facial recognition and a potato web cam. They both have fingerprint readers. I think everything else is same.,0.008,0.92,0.072,0.9656,1

But it's got very little rendering power especially compared a way bigger XPS 15.

Eliminating potential causes is probably only way troubleshoot and it be tedious. Booting into safe mode is an idea don't encounter same problem then more confidently blame software since safe mode only allow core services start. Remove whatever software think is sketchy and just rinse and repeat. it's still buggered 'd generally remove some memory and see how it goes.

gjw1kz,Dell,I've bought 2 refurbished XPS's through Dell Outlet and both were in excellent condition 9.9/10 and no battery wear. My experience is that Dell does a good job inspecting their refurbished devices sure they are in like new condition.,0.048,0.702,0.25,0.8481,1
gjw1kz,Dell,’s unfortunate that they raised prices on old model as soon as new one came out. I ordered mine a week before base model graphics card and got it for 1180 using few coupon codes and dell chat they give good discounts!!! . ’re not up for chat it should go down eventually but I’ve also heard good things about dell outlet although I didn’t order from it because at time they didn’t have model I wanted Good luck!,0.023,0.804,0.173,0.9302,1
gjw1kz,Dell,So many people miss out complaining about refurbs when they are actually tested better than a new one.

's quad core I don't think 'll have any issue computing power and vast majority of tasks.,0.102,0.867,0.031,-0.5267,-1
gjtncx,Dell,I just got 7390 2-in-1 and it has 16 10 and Ice Lake like 9300 and it's worth it. Not sure where are hearing slower there are maybe some certain benchmarks it's a few percent slower but 10x as many that trounce older one especially once graphics are involved. They are both same generation processor but Comet Lake is on older 14nm process it's more like 9th gen they never launched while Ice Lake is on new 10nm process and more efficient and double graphics power.,0.033,0.835,0.132,0.8444,1
gjtncx,Dell,They improved alot of things newer model. base model now has a much brighter 500 nit screen as standard. old one hit 300 nits. newer one has a 100% srgb display. Older one hit around 65%. speakers have been improved. track pad is much bigger. processors are not slower. Ghz clock speed isn't only way measure perfomance. What also matter is instructions per clock or ipc which has improved alot on newer models. Graphics on i5 has also seen a bit of a bump i7 having biggest jump. older models also have big issues overheating yes they may be advertised as hitting 4ghz or more but in reality that's an up speed they hit it for a few seconds but actual sustained performance is far far lower.,0.022,0.894,0.084,0.6187,1
gjtncx,Dell,new CPU in 9300 is... hmmm. In CPU performance it's slightly better than 4 core CPUs in older XPS models e.g i7-10510U . Long story short frequency is lower but they do more calculations in a single clock cycle Hz so it balances out. There are some use-case specific differences. For example Ice Lake 10th gen G parts are better for vectorized workloads. But 're dealing intensive multithreaded workloads then 6-core i7-10710U is usually better. For most people I would say... this isn't a big deal. But it is worth noting G4 and G7 configurations have much better integrated GPU performance 50% so this is a big plus for 9300 much better for any e.g light gaming . Anyway overall I would say 9300 is a better machine. I don't think it's worth extra money in an objective sense - improvements are nice but they aren't essential or game changing in any way. go Dell Factory Outlet and get an older XPS or a Latitude 7400 save hundreds of dollars and it'll do everything 'd for many years come. But subjectively speaking... 16 10 aspect ratio upgraded iGPU etc and comfortably afford 9300... well yeah... You do I guess.,0.007,0.801,0.191,0.9901,1

gjum7g,Dell,Yeah that's how Optimus system works. When tab out check dGPU's usage on task manager game stops rendering in background so... there is not much works for dGPU do hence low usage. And when 're watching video it's considered be light task so system automatically use your iGPU do decoding instead of using your dGPU. frame rate drops 're describing is thermal throttling/power throttling and has nothing do GPU's usage. This is caused by CPU/GPU/any other components on motherboard overheating and laptop has intentionally gimp performance prevent itself from catching on fire lol.

gjkbjg,Dell,There are indeed a couple of compounded issues here. Price hike in UK / Europe compared USA and also Apple comparison. Here are some comparisons and spec for spec difference is vast go checkout in US stores and add Sales Tax. we actually look at prices of models equivalent a high grade MBP. Top End New Dell XPS 15 10750H 32GB Ram 1TB SSD UK Store 2499 US Store inc Sales tax California 2652 2168 MBP 2.3GHz 8-core 9th-gen i9 Turbo 4.8GHz 32GB Ram 1TB SSD UK Store 3199 US Store inc. Cali sales tax 3475 2840 I find this quite telling. UK customers are generally getting shafted on exchange rates European customers most likely too. All in all it does sense probably fly USA buy laptop back when international travel resumes. In terms of MBP comparison I think Dell probably are setting prices proportionally behind Apple.

gjkbjg,Dell,prices aren’t really disappointing but configs are. we had some decent customization options getting i7 8gb ram 86Wh and 256 ssd for example we could get a cheaper xps and upgrade it along way. But there are two things note 1 This laptop looks very expensive screen panels are Dell only new speakers bigger touchpad double thunderbolts double ssd better build/cooling. These things cost money. 2 Dell knows we would buy cheaper one and upgrade it ourselves which means they earn less. They wont that at least for now people are ready pay premium get these asap. Another reason why they look so expensive is fact that Apple’s MBP16 exists and Apple has for once priced it correctly. is a better laptop than 15 and a lighter option 17 better speakers and build. For platform agnostic amongst us Macbook makes this a very weird situation. I probably wait for sales on XPS and decide between MBP16 and XPS.,0.038,0.872,0.09,0.8876,1
gjkbjg,Dell,I read in another post in this sub that in June-July there's a price-drop thanks sales and also save up 60%.

I understand it's because of VAT but come on brands couldn't do anything their products more affordable ? Almost all big tech brands do that thinking people in Europe be ok buying a new device € 500 more expensive than their neighbour from across Atlantic... nearly be cheaper take a trip US and buy your brand new device there.

No delivery date was not accurate. unit arrived over three weeks after date specified - I think this severe delay was due Covid-19 situation though so it is understandable. Also Perth is one of most isolated cities in world so deliveries are always delayed. 2 - I am unable answer this as this is my first XPS I have always owned Macs before this.

All types of start-up have been very snappy for me so far restarts. 's not something I think about at all. 5. I've only heard fan once since I got it while updating like 45 Windows apps. Not loud at all. Honestly dude I don't think 're previous experience Dells bodes at all how these things perform they are awesome. people that are loving their machines generally don't post about it.

gju5pf,Dell,I do my best answer your questions from my experience my XPS 9300 i7 / 16GB Ram / 512GB SSD / FHD non-touch. 1 - No my unit is completely stable. I have read a few people complaining of this issue on new models however it seems majority of people do not seem be experiencing this problem myself included . 2- IMO keyboard is fantastic. Having come from a Macbook this keyboard is a joy use. Only slight issue positioning of home / end / delete / arrow keys but its easy once get used it. are not sure get your self down an electronic store and try typing on one in person! 3- new models have windows hello so use Face ID log on - it works very well in my experience i have not had use fingerprint scanner or pin once. Having tested FP scanner it seems work well. 4- This is an interesting one. laptop wakes up pretty much instantly from sleep. HOWEVER my laptop is not used for a while 30min - 1hr then when i open lid dell logo appears for approx 10-15 seconds before i log in. I am not sure this is meant happen as a power saving option or my laptop is defective but it is slightly annoying. I am sure a bit of digging in power management settings this be fixed.... 5- For me I very rarely hear fan - only when i first got unit for a day or two whilst it was indexing and when installing software or updating system - then it is not super loud. I have heard that some people have fan on full throttle when watching a HD youtube videos however this is something i have not experienced. I do not use it for gaming or heavy CPU usage therefore i would not be able give a truly accurate answer. 6- Currently using info provided from a battery report my battery's average is 7.5 hours however others are getting around 8-10 mark. I am not sure as why mine is under performing - I only use it for surfing web and writing work documents....? This is something i look into. Other issues - i have been having problems my BT audio - audio stutters every 10-15 seconds. This is VERY annoying. I have tried re-installing audio driver but no fix. I suspect issue may lie MaxxAudio Pro Waves. - when on full volume keys vibrate at certain frequencies. This is slightly annoying also but i rarely have my laptop on full vol so i don't mind. Again i am not sure this is a design floor or my unit being defective. I have a technician due come out at end of this month investigate / fix both issues. Many of my posts on here fell on deaf ears so i made an effort try and help - I hope this helps ,0.113,0.8,0.086,-0.8891,-1

Most people doing serious or prolonged work have a docking station and dual display setup so no laptop screen ever replace that. Speaker upgrade again nice but meh wireless earbuds are very affordable and convenient and anybody wants better sound for odd occasion then a decent bluetooth speaker does sense. Doesn't mean we've all been carrying around a bluetooth speaker everywhere in past few years... 're working on a laptop it's because usually have do work in a public place in a cafe bus train plane... 're going be using headphones. 're at home 're hooking up your laptop your speakers. Not a fan of irreplaceable wifi card especially it does turn out be Killer WiFi... I've replaced Killer WiFi in my last two Dell laptops because of numerous issues and just annoyance of having Killer bloat wanting be installed i know i know i've used Uninstaller but it still ends up coming back and just frustrating deal . Have they solved heat issues? I guess we'll have wait and see. Obviously someone has a 9550 or older and looking get a new laptop then for sure this would sense.

Not bad for 1900USD and have a spare 256GB drive or sell it for around 40usd . As I said else where touch model also seems adequately priced but would really benefit from having 8-core CPU stock.

I think I’ll try hold out on ordering anything until I see some user reviews. What other laptops are considering? I’ve been eyeing Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. I’m not sure I actually get a “gaming laptop” but it looks pretty subdued and would likely outperform xps while saving a few hundred dollars. Unfortunately it doesn’t have a webcam.

As indy runner15 suggests could go Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. That seems nice dave2d review .

gj4os4,Dell,I think XPS line it's really a hit or a miss. I currently have 7590 and have had no problems at all save for some thermal throttling and thermal issues. I was able fix all of that through a proper undervolt process I tested each undervolt until I would BSOD . I haven't really experienced any other issues other than that though. I'm not sure it has do quality control or I don't know much about computers but my unit has been amazing! I game it occasionally and lockdowns happening I've been gaming it a lot.

giq99c,Dell,This sounds more like a software issue instead of a hardware issue. I would recommend backing up your laptop an external drive software like Acronis True Image and completely reinstall Win10. When reinstalling Win10 there's a few things should do. Beforehand go dell support website and download ALL drivers/software packages for your laptop and stick it on a USB drive or something. I'd recommend NOT connecting internet during installation process because a force create a microsoft account which don't your PC be attached and b it auto-install drivers that are likely be out of date compared ones got from Dell's website. So reinstall win10 install all drivers from USB. I also recommend using PC decrapifyer uninstall dell bloatware and please use Win10Debloater uninstall default Win10 bloat Office trial candy crush Minecraft netflix etc... This ensure cleanest installation of Win10 possible. After 're done I recommend imaging your hard drive again so restore that state later run into problems again. Ninja edit -- I add These were first steps I followed when I received my 7590 this past January. was plagued software issues sleep issues windows explorer 1909 bug bloat issues internet issues . Reinstalling Windows stable 1903 update fixed all of these for me. ALSO Look up how disable S1 Modern Sleep. 's a sleep mode designed for Surface tablets that for some reason Dell enables on their laptops causing weird sleep behavior and major battery drainage.,0.03,0.83,0.139,0.9746,1
giq99c,Dell,Your first step is ensure your system is configured properly. There are settings in BIOS and OS that prevents S3 sleep. FYI. There are only 2 sleep states S3 sleep S4 hibernate and S5 power off. S1/S2 refers different working states unrelated this issue. Navigate power option in control panel and go into advanced setting ensure everything is correct. Google it . I not repeat those available on Google. 1 your first step is ensure have a healthy sleep state. Set your sleep timer 1min boot clean then observe your system goes S3 sleep then wake it up. You do this a few times sure don't have a intermittent sleep problem. necessary use CMD run 'powercfg -requests' troubleshoot anything prevent S3. You unplug everything when do this - some USB/other devices may wake system up in wake-on-LAN or other similar events. 2 repeat step 1 power connected. This verifies your S3 is healthy when power is plugged. Note system has different setting when adapter is connected. 3 Leave system in S3 for 10-20mins observe any screen lit or temperature rise on keyboard hot spot is near F9 key which suggests OS secretly wake up due some events. have a Fluke meter thermal probe do this fairly easily. 4 have gone through 1 - 3 then are sure your OS is OK. Now get software part. Open browser Office and everything could think of. Then leave system idle trigger S3 and let it sit observe abnormal screen/thermal events. This normally happen in 10-20mins it happens. 5 system overheats in step 4 use binary search identify which software/element is causing this. This would take a few hours but it systematically find out what causes your problem.,0.027,0.884,0.089,0.8475,1
giq99c,Dell,’re tech savvy enough go through all those troubleshooting steps it’s safe assume also undervolt your 9570? I say this because I’ve done that mine and experience same thing when I go high enough keep stable during use but not enough supply processor enough juice wake from sleep. not undervolt then it definitely has do one of Dell’s crapware messing system.

I have a 4K 9550 i7-6600HQ and have always found it a bit sluggish which I've always thought was hardware struggling drive high resolution display. Yes it's nice know that display is amazing but I honestly say that for me I think it's been more trouble than it's worth. Support for HiDPI in a few applications that I use has been a bit ropey and I 't be doing workarounds and hacks just so I see things properly. Four years on I have no doubt that there's now sufficient performance push all those pixels around but I'm asking myself I'd miss it speccing a replacement a FHD panel. I certainly don't look at 24 FHD displays I use my desktop and think that they look crap and there are way fewer DPI there.

gj231s,Dell,AMD is a big gamble when rebuild laptop's internals from ground up and lose Thunderbolt. Not only that but get a problem where a good portion of consumers are stuck in mindset of AMD 't compete Intel on desktop let alone mobile. All of this makes it a very dangerous proposition put AMD in your flagship laptop. I've seen poll results heavily favoring AMD at moment and it's pretty clear that this community is eager see new stuff. That's good but there are going be teething issues. What there's worse stuff than it's a bit of a fireball and some issues 't be fixed? Would still buy it? other issue is AMD's power management isn't quite as fine-tuned as Intels so we're going see higher idle utilization on AMD as well which means we won't get battery life we expect out of same battery sizes.

In anything like this class of system tiny laptop Intel-U processor there be no meaningful difference from upgrading DDR4 LPDDR4-4266 it simply won't matter period. sole exception is for iGPU performance when e.g gaming but care much about this then a laptop Intel HD 620 is probably not right choice from outset and should wait for refresh anyway Ice Lake has a much better iGPU which is already much more significant than RAM anyway .,0.061,0.816,0.124,0.8929,1

ginhql,Dell,Most Dell machines come 10% factory wear which is actually intended bad calibration. Li-Po batteries degrade faster when charging 90-100% of their true capacity along trickle charging at 99-100%. Some companies feel bite on customer support. Knowing typical consumer not wisely avoid those limitations or program his charge schedule compensate for them they just ship 10% wear. Of course all claims of battery longevity in marketing material do not account for synthetic wear and reviewers get models without this most of times. There are ways manually remove 10% wear.

gi8m7h,Dell,Undervolting is unlickely void warranty but advice be discrete on that aspect. Youve many options. One could be call Dell and explain overheating issues they run a couple of test and probably help a solution. Even a huge repair like a motherboard replacement or fan replacement not be solution. youve a working machine now have same issues in future and have find what software wise works for . Tweaking Dell devices sometimes be a huge pain. First of all youve know more about why your CPU temps are so high. What are your iddle temps max temps max clocks etc... Have tried cleaning fans ? Or repasting a quality paste ? That miracles. I would go for a fresh windows 10 install sure all drivers are working properly and repaste thing could a huge difference as well as some pads on vrms etc possible. x200B Also sure your undervolt is really effective and see increase it possible how much undervolt youre running right now ?

giemnr,Dell,incoming rant... My laptop i got in user tag years after I graduated bought laptop in 2019 graduated 2017 . That said I'd suggest looking elsewhere before considering a dell g7/g5. BIOS has been a CONSTANT issue for many people this laptop and pending on what version get determine how unhappy be. Issues include but not limited stuttering/freezing bad thermal performance fan curves lack of options for powefan profiles etc. Look into some other brands and see get opinions on how users feel that model like are here. As far as battery goes reasonably expect poor life just about any gaming laptop as far as I am aware. This line I'd say reasonably expect 2 maybe 3 hours mild use. Performance on battery be heavily reduced. With full tweaking expect enough performance watch 1080p 60 fps youtube but thats pushing it. DO decide get one heres what I did my laptop which is a slight upgrade and/or different from g5 mitigate most of issues and max performance thermal i redid my thermal paste for CPU/GPU screen color upgraded a 120hz panel storage replaced HDD 1TB SSD ram upgraded from 16 32GB bios stopped updating after 1.9 wish i could go back 1.3 i hear its best for my model power options tweaked settings so CPU doesn't throttle as bad on battery disable nvidia GPU in device manager for a more performance. surface temp i rigged a fan setup at my desk cool everything down just that bit extra. unless they fixed issues after my model made in 2018 doubt it expect similar fun times All said and done however for price I got mine 880 300 in upgrades it isn't a bad laptop that does great while plugged in and is adequate enough for short stints on battery. Desktop performance lets me run Destiny 2 1080p 60fps highest settings etc. TL DR look elsewhere before considering dell IMO. Linus Tech Tips constantly does laptop reviews. 're serious about using for classes I suggest getting a more battery friendly laptop not gaming ,0.05,0.809,0.141,0.9895,1

After I replaced it Intel 9260 I had no more wifi issues whatsoever. Another thing was coil whine. Disabling C-states in BIOS resolved issue. Then sleep issues on Windows but not Linux this resolved issue And finally audio popping also only on Windows resolved help of this thread Now only issues I have is lack of a trackpoint like on Thinkpads or trackball as I despise touchpads and that keyboard is just okay as opposed keyboard on Thinkpads which is usually good but since I do no longer work on my personal computer therefore XPS is a solid device I'd buy again at that time especially considering that external GPU and monitor it runs new games very well I'm playing M B Bannerlord on it recently .

Basicly same as a WD15 i think You also use OEM portable battery from dells that use usb C. You could connect battery charger and charge battery de dell power brick have. Im not 100% sure but i think charge both at a time. 2nd hand docks sells for way cheaper. Any dell dock do trick a dock. be on go portable battery is better advantage that always have a power bank in case one. Try posting in dell oficial forum. Prepared people there might help much more details than me. Ps. laptops fans are runing at 2500rpms constantly while docked.

Not unreasonable. We have one of best consumer laws in world. Under Australian Consumer Law all goods are expected last a reasonable amount of time. And that reasonable amount of time is SEVEN years. Period. Anyways as soon as a hearing date was set Dell immediately gave me a full refund. I'm assuming it would've cost them more than just refund they had defend themselves court costs 'strike' against their name etc. Most people don't take it this far and Dell know this so they get away it!

gi3sej,Dell,Update I think I figured it out. When laptop is plugged in or docked ie on AC power it recognizes all cores and threads. Confirmed in dxdiag cpu-z and CB15 and CB20. 4 cores 8 threads when plugged in. On battery power it seems disable hyperthreading. Only 4 processes run and from what I tell it is using 4 cores just no HT. I could be wrong though our cups be disabling two cores on battery. Now I get muck about in battery settings see I disable that lovely /s feature.,0.094,0.863,0.043,-0.5574,-1
gi3n0c,Dell,I have same configuration as I tell what helped me reduce temps. Undervolting using ThrottleStop Turning off HyperThreading in BIOS Yes I know that by turning off HyperThreading reduce cores from 8 4 but this gives me much more higher and stable performance and reduced temps. As for undervolt it decreased my temps by about 5 degrees which is not much but was just enough stop it from thermal throttling GPU. Good luck!,0.041,0.791,0.168,0.8735,1

gpnhql,ASUS,I have ASUS Zephryus GA502 w/ 1660ti Max Q and Ryzen 7 3750H. On idle I am at around 45C-50C. On some load like Photoshop for 3 hours I am hovering 70C-80C. With a simple elevation stand 15 that raises laptop one inch off surface I was seeing 5C-10C decrease and on load as well. With a cooling pad I was seeing same results. way my laptop was designed air flow circulation is limited area above they keyboard. cooling pad helped but not as much as I would like due design of my asus laptop. NOTE I also like my 15 stand over my laptop ran cooler because it is portable. folds nearly and I put it in my laptop bag. I use this set up me everywhere. GOOD AIRFLOW ON THE GO 🙂.

And better buy something like rubber legs for laptop or small stand just so laptop is rised above table a little so it could take more air in but really there is no reason buy cooling pad fans for your laptop as they work good only for some laptops which designs allows laptop take more air from cooling pad and also it would at BEST decrease your temperatures by about -5 compared just a little stand without coolers.

gpwyak,ASUS,Okay so specify exact temperatures of your CPU/GPU. 80-90c is absolutely fine for a CPU in a thin gaming laptop however it's not okay 're GPU is hitting those temps. Anything above 84c for GPU and like 92-93c for CPU is considered bad. So download Afterburner and monitor your temps properly first. There are a few things do before repasting. You undervolt your CPU undervolt your GPU and limit your CPU turbo boost. Make sure know how do these things first. Also since it's a new laptop send it in for them repaste it for don't wanna void warranty.

gppo22,ASUS,I'm not experienced Fortnite but I heared it's quite a heavy game surprisingly. Anyways try following things Basics - Make sure 're playing while laptop is charging 're probably doing this already . battery 't deliver enough power for a powerful GPU thus lowering performance. Windows settings - Right click battery icon in taskbar down below and click Windows Mobility Center . One of tiles shows an image of a battery and probably have balanced in that same tile. Click on balanced and set that High Performance . This increase maximum power delivered your laptop which means more performance but lower battery life. NVidia Control Panel - Right click desktop then NVidia Control Panel. In menu on left click Manage 3D Settings . In list of settings scroll down Power Management Mode . Set this Prefer maximum performance . This tells GPU that performance is more important than battery life. Now on that same page go Program Settings . Check Fortnite is in list of programs. this is not case click Add Browse and go wherever fortnite is installed possibly C Program Files Epic Games Fortnite . Add whatever starts Fortnite I expect this be Fortnite or Fortnite.exe . it is in list ignore that part. Set power management in this list also this is not on prefer maximum performance . - Make sure it uses High Performance NVidia Processor how however it's called and not Integrated Graphics or Auto Select . This forces game run on NVidia GPU. - In control panel click Adjust image settings preview in left menu. Select Use my performance emphasizing and set this performance. This reduce graphics a bit there's a preview so see effects directly for a bit of extra performance. Fans I do not know where change this in an ASUS laptop so somebody or interwebs else might be able help out. Your fans cool down your device. could be that temperatures in laptop might be too high squeeze out extra performance. Setting fan curve a more aggressive one fans blow earlier and harder might get some extra performance but 'll have check that is possible that laptop I assume it is and how do that. This should help a lot already. Do keep in mind that advertised performance is measured in a perfect scenario possibly overclocked hardware which I absolutely do not recommend doing in a laptop or that it was measured strongest GPU that is in that series.

gpfhbq,ASUS,Well depending on what failed might be able fix laptop yourself. it's just heat re-pasting installing a fresh Windows image and then undervolting responsibly may help. it's battery replace those from online stores depending on model. Keep in mind just like re-pasting this could require a lot of work on your part but save a 3000 investment I believe it's worth it. As for other suggestions find better quality unfortunately many modern laptops follow recent trend of going as thin and light as possible... Which of course leads stability issues on more powerful hardware. You should check out Jarrod's Tech on YouTube. He gives unbiased reviews on hardware and isn't afraid lay into a system it doesn't meet his standards. machines he reviews tend be gaming laptops. Keep in mind more often than not on this forum 're more likely run into people who have problems a product because it's working fine most people don't have an interest in participating forums. But there is a problem they'll let everybody know. Of course in th case of ASUS general consensus is they're shit now. G14 might buy them some praise but I don't expect it'll be long before thermal issues start pop up that thing. new Alienware M15 R3 features vapor chamber cooling which has been known be handy but since it just launched it'll be some time before we know it helps much... Plus Alienware price jump is something be concerned about. Overall just research machines before buy them.

gp3mrf,ASUS,Yep. Check are connected and not on battery power. Check your power plan is on High Performance. Check on Armory Crate are not in Silent Profile. You should be in Performance or Boost/Turbo Profile. Am not sure of naming but get idea. Check your games are using Dedicated GPU and not Integrated IGPU. x200B Videos on youtube show laptops in best light. Using Dual channel RAMs and stuff like that. You may not know about those things.,0.017,0.817,0.166,0.9345,1
gp3mrf,ASUS,You probably only have one stick of ram. You check it in something like cpu-z. You'll buy ram kit like 8x2 or 16x2 or just buy 1 more stick of ram same specs your ones. Because when ram is in dual channel mode it increase fps by about 40% or more because 1 stick of ram becomes bottleneck. I recommend buying Corsair Vengeance ram 2666mhz.,0.0,0.855,0.145,0.8316,1

gp4y97,ASUS,706II is listed as having R5 not R7 when I google it. x200B I have 706Iu and it has R7 4800. After getting settled into it I'm loving snappyness of it. I play Battlefield V CS GO Which is CPU driven an flies Planetside2 and couple other titles and it handles sessions no problem. does get loud during a AAA game session but after enabling vsync an locking monitor 60hz for power saving and locking in fps 60 max its very manageable sound wise fans. So 15 incher might be easier tote around but loses a couple inches of screen estate bigger brother 706 and like gaming or watching HDR movies etc I'd grab 17. Registering at Asus forums is a pia sure do it after getting one get into Rog fourms. Also as Ive learned have a couple flash drives for troubleshooting an restoring they recommend having at least 8gb flashdrive for making a reinstall media and another flashdrive back up eSupport folder on SSD that holds all first run and basic drivers laptop needs be returned stock form as well as anything else may aquire along way install immediately after a wipe needed. Something i noticed is a lot of 15 inch Tufs come one stick of ram which means system runs in single channel mode. 17s come pairs of ram modules so they are in dual channel out of box. x200B Hope it helps and enjoy your new laptop either one. Report back which way roll. x200B Edit add 17 in my case comes a 90whr battery and most 15 come a 48 76whr it be a noticeable difference there when away from a plug in.,0.028,0.836,0.137,0.9861,1

All this results in temps that regularly climb into mid high 90s which for modern processing architectures is actually within spec but still hot enough for concern when failure threshold is just above 100 degrees Celsius. fear of having these software systems break and fail cool processors in time prevent damage is one of many reasons I hardly ever touch my GA502. All this could be avoided they just nut up and machines a little thicker better pasting dedicated heat pipes and bigger fans and jet engine series as I like call them is proof they do this and still have laptops looking quite nice and very portable. In fact I favor old aesthetic from a purely visual standpoint as well. I don't know what it is about gaming PC manufacturers feeling like everything has be as thin and light as possible. This is a tangent frankly this whole comment is but cell phone industry did this excessively until like three years ago when they realized they simply 't pack all these features into an ultra-slim ultra-light design without making concessions on battery and heat yes phones and tablets overheat and it happens more often than many think . Now 'll notice cell phones are getting bigger and heavier better displays tonplacate ignorant masses who thought slim-and-light was just bee's knees. big difference cell phones is that your battery gets too hot expands punctures itself on an internal component and ignites your handheld device just turned into a chemical bomb. On a laptop however thing just fail operate before anything gets hot enough physically harm user... But 'll still have lost some expensive hardware. So why haven't PC manufacturers taken notes on this? 's not just an ASUS issue Dell has same fixation their Alienware M15/M17 series being super thin and while those do actually function better under most circumstances while hot 90 Celsius range they control throttling and still deliver consistent performance they shouldn't be getting that hot in first place.

gnr09e,ASUS,That's a sign of a dying ROM or flash chip itself. I fixed some Motorolas in past who had similar problems booting up and/or crashing and fixed it by reinstalling ROM on phone. You'll a Windows PC ROM for that specific ASUS device and a flash tool. Every manufacturer has its own tools. By googling it's likely that 'll find a tutorial on how flash ASUS phones or THAT specific phone. After reinstalling ROM completely problem should be gone. it STILL happens it's a hardware failure Though unlikely since your phone boots up Since go through steps of flashing a complete ROM could check out LineageOS. 's an Android that doesn't come bloatware and is 100% pure Play Store must flash manually. Currently it's on Android 10 Would be an upgrade for faster than ASUS lol Plus points by installing this ROM mentioned above tutorial has 100% covered and just follow steps. revert later it's possible.

gmsi0c,ASUS,Undervolt GPU in MSI afterburner unfortunately no undervolt be done on mobile AMD chips run fans at max speed limit fps match refreshrate of your screen so GPU doesn't have work overtime. And that would be it i think softwarewise don't sacrifice performance ofc. You also check new BIOS changelog on ASUS website maybe they adjusted fan profiles. Repaste CPU and GPU better thermal compund not sure that void warranty . Check heatsink is properly seated. I'm afraid that these high temps are caused by maxed thermal headroom on ASUS part. You are getting crazy performance in a very compact chassis. result is high thermals unfortunately. 90-95C is within spec however i would avoid running in these temps as it shorten your G14's lifespan.,0.104,0.857,0.04,-0.7478,-1

gmmnyx,ASUS,No matter what GPU choose that CPU all of them be bottlenecked. Most of games don't use CPU that much so in 99% of cases 'll see your CPU utilisation at 30% while GPU is at 99%. That doesn't mean won't get some good performance out of it. 's about that in terms of graphic intensive games CPU always wait for GPU no matter it's an 2080ti or a 1650ti it's only about what performance that graphics card push in end. To give an example CPU at 30% utilisation and 1650ti at 100% utilisation get 60FPS in a specific game While in same scenario but an 2080ti get 100fps at 100% GPU utilisation.

They referred me onto another department ASUS Australia and having sent a fresh e-mail i.e. my enquiry was not referred internally I got a reply just one day later!

gjg0u7,ASUS,I have one in use for about 2 weeks and at first I was really disappointed. This device really has a problem temperatures when in stock conditions. At first battery run time was not near those values represented in youtube reviews but newest firmware 5 6 1/2 hours below mentioned office tasks are realistic which is pretty sweet in my opinion. Overall build quality is more than OK for price available ports are also decent and I like look because it looks not gamey . I ve bought mine for 1350 EUR 4800HS 1660TI 16GB RAM 1 TB NVME incl. Taxes compared G14 in same configuration rougly 2000 EUR incl. Taxes this notebook offers good value. Coming from a desktop I ve always found it somewhat strange that temperatures from 85 - 95 C are considered normal for a notebook. I personally accept temperatures around 80 C they occur under heavy performance duties aka gaming. Average CPU GPU Temperatures below tweaks Office tasks like browsing coding watching videos 41 - 54 C Gaming Bannerlord Total War Warhammer 2 65 - 72 C Unfortunately fans are not software controllable yet so when doing office tasks my temps slowly increase from 40 54 C and fans then start working. Software related Probably most f upped power plan settings I ve ever seen did result device deliver a minimum 100 % of power cpu - CPU temps when browsing avg. 65 - 67 C Can be solved by reducing minimum wattage 3 - 5 % device constantly boost cpu under heavy conditions like gaming it is not close necessary set maximum wattage 99 % this cause lower base clock speeds which is not what or modify one entry in registry so disabling CPU-boost in power plan settings. As this CPU is game changing powerful I did not notice any differences. Armoury Crate Performance Settings do some really strange things on my device so I ve set mode Windows and modified two power plan settings that I am comfortable Hardware related pasting is really poor I estimate Dies have been covered by about 95 % I have repasted every chip that is cooled by heatpipe one tube of 3.5g Gelid GC extreme - really solid improvement. Just be aware that different screws have been used so take notes or pictures. Even when unscrewed heatpipe does not come off easily apply some reasonable force. Before this process I ve only done some mods on desktops so this whole thing felt like a operation me D When correctly done this should not remove your warranty in most countries afaik air vents of CPU GPU fan are blocked by what I call it AMD paper. Removing this paper again decrease your temperatures by a lot. This void your warranty so do it as are comfortable it or not. ASUS states this is improve air flow other mainboard components see youtube reviews but I call that bullshit. exact same chassis has been used for a new Intel version of this notebook and guess what despite exact same components air intakes are not blocked. I did take a risk here because I feel this way notebook has a chance reach a respectable life span otherwise I think those temperatures it be case of warranty runs out and it destroys itself. There is a temperature sensor for NVME present and temperatures now are same or lower I did not any notes for this unfortunately.,0.098,0.774,0.128,0.9665,1

gjiikh,ASUS,sorry not answering all of your post but 1 when try boot it s always go bios ? in sata mode ? i think so from what writted but i be sure. because could boot on one of your devices an error... in doc of your motherboard i see enable/disable SATA6 G1 SATA6 G6 and then hotplug enable/disable for each sata port ? is this same in your bios version ? Optane CSM must be disable CSM disable save reboot go bios . see new parameters set UEFI enable. in Boot devices control set uefi only or uefi and legacy oprom know how configure optane sorry else see video here video is in english x200B 2 had try boot your OS boot device alone ? could pulg off other devices and boot it alone ? hdd and optane off.. ? 3 did update bios firmware 0805 2401 directly or had used other firmware between ? nothing else is ok at end could downgrade bios older version your bios allows it. perhaps have update another version before. just wondering i could be wrong here for exemple Version 20012019/05/1510.31 MBytes PRIME Z370-A BIOS 2001 Updated IRST for latest Intel processors support Intel Optane memory. Please sure update RST driver 17.2.6.1027 version or later for better compatibility. 4 procedure i gave was for same issue but last step was for a second issue don t get. plus procedure t be same because of motherboard/bios differences but could be helping by trying something close. so sorry because i had same issue my nvme boot device after a bios update and could fix it. i have look in my bios parameters help further but i have no optane,0.063,0.826,0.11,0.9567,1

gj3k8t,ASUS,I don't have this particular model but I have a rog laptop and I'd suggest stay far away from brand. quality of their products are questionable and customer support is a nightmare.,0.087,0.804,0.11,0.1901,1
gj3k8t,ASUS,Well it's a lottery. I got my Rog Strix g531gu on last week and i haven't any major problems so far. I also asked people on Reddit what they think about that laptop and some of them were really disappointed but also many of them said that it's quite good laptop. What i tell is that this laptop is good not terrible not nice just good. does have some software problems but it's acceptable for that price. I would recommend buy it but MUST check it before buying i mean turn it on in a store run some stress tests and everything be fine then take it. Good luck would buy this laptop i would like hear your review so text me in direct .,0.04,0.664,0.297,0.9894,1
gj3k8t,ASUS,I say go for new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 processing power that isn't only for productivity but ultra settings gaming as well. thing is a beast and provides more than enough power for everyday tasks in a thin and light package as well as boasting a 10-hour battery life doing everyday tasks such as browsing which really is impressive for a mobile gaming solution. new Ryzen 9 chip absolutely dominates any other mobile processer and it's packed an RTX 2060 as well. whole thing comes a 1tb ssd and 16gb of ram for 1450 which is really solid. I believe most impressive aspect of laptop is its thermal solution which was so well thought out pretty rare for ASUS be honest . Inside there is a dual heat sink dual fans and ample vents on side center and bottom. ergonomic lift allows for greater airflow and a solid typing angle. keyboard is fantastic although backlighting is a bit uneven. Because of this design flaw I would go for black model. screen has a 120 hz refresh rate and a really rgb gradient as well as solid nits in brightness. Response time is a tab bit off but its barely noticeable and really solid for gaming manageable ghosting as well. Build quality is really good as well lots of thought and care went into a very sleek design. outdoes previous ROG iterations 10 fold.

I have Top Spec for this for nearly 2.5k USD and I have spent another 500USD upgrade internals swap rams thermal repasting change SSD apply thermal pad etc... why thermal repasting u asked? because this shit thermal throttle like hell and asus really sucks at cooling. anti dust ventilator means more dust accumulated due higher fan count. bull shit everywhere.,0.227,0.688,0.085,-0.9701,-1

gj3k8t,ASUS,I personally have a rog and its 531gu .. i think its just differs in ssd coz i have only 256gb. i wont say stay away from this brand it performs really well for 3D MODELLING WITH REAL TIME RENDERING IN ARNOLD VIDEO EDITING FX in AFTER EFFECTS nuke or whatever and also FOR GAMING because I personally did all these and still doing it. regarding brand i love it. price asus is providing better configuration. im not much concerned plastic. coz every brand is providing plastic only .plastic is plastic. . are concerned performance and spec go for rog. it gives awesome gaming spec. better build quality than rog go for dell lenovo. but there most probably have compromise on gpu wont get 1660 ti. 1660/1650/1060 otherwise might have pay more. or processor might change from intel amd it is not so bad thou . As far as i know laptops are compromised in spec and performance compared PC because there is a for limiting heat. but we really a laptop we have go for laptop not pc we get better configuration and performance. so regarding fan sound. less fan sound less heat compact size and incredible performance. its hard get altogether. amount of money we have compromise on some. and these days quality of every brand is almost same alienware. some guy is already mentioned it in comments. for heating get an external laptop cooler fan . it'll help laptop cool faster. a little bit but it counts that too after intense gaming is done dont expect it be ice cool during gaming. external fan help little air flow around laptop. so finally have enough money go for this model because 1660ti is really awesome mobile gpu its far better than other 16 series and way better than 1060. and im not gonna compare 1080 its legend in market. and new RTX graphics are way too overpriced. sorry for my bad english ,0.013,0.803,0.184,0.9961,1

Performance and Turbo deliver full power at all times latter ramping up fan speed a greater degree. Even I manually set minimum processor state 5% done through advanced power profile options in Windows control panel in either profile CPU never downclocks remaining in 4.0-4.2 GHz range. In Silent mode processor downclocks properly. There's a registry tweak for power options that exposes a separate option disable turbo boost all together so CPU's maximum frequency top out at 2.6 GHz. I did this for Silent profile and it's been working out really well. 's my primary gaming profile since most of games I'm playing are older and/or not particularly demanding. should work well for Oblivion in your case and it's also surprisingly capable for newer releases. With optimized silent profile system still average more than 90 fps in Forza Motorsport 7 a minimum of about 75.

ghd2pi,ASUS,This may be too simple so I apologize in advance. ☺ When router shows internet status as disconnected hook a wired device laptop wired network port is good directly modem powered box between router and cable that goes out of house . wired device connects router has issues it does not connect most likely is your internet service provider has issues. One thing I do when I get disconnected response is check modem status. Depends on model modem manuals are available for download typically that show what lights mean but lights on front of modem are mostly off a problem your provider is likely issue. Also most modems have a reset button that be pushed a toothpick or paper clip. internet is disconnected resetting modem sometimes helps. Hope that helps!,0.027,0.865,0.108,0.8682,1

ggova1,ASUS,Sorry 're dealing this I've had deal it on a Strix Hero 2 GL504GM. Basically I had laptop for a while and it worked but then fans decided they're gonna be full blast for rest of time. Sent it in and they replaced motherboard which worked for a bit then it started doing whatever it wanted again. I have no solution because I built a new PC about a month ago. I know this is strange and doesn't sense at all but I took 2.5in hard drive out of my laptop and stuck it in my new PC and stuck old m.2 back in laptop so I could have 1tb m.2 for my PC and now fan runs silent. I 't explain it and honestly I don't care because I only rarely use my laptop now but figured I'd mention that it works properly no 2.5 hdd in it. Good luck I might just suggest returning thing and getting something from Acer I know predator Helios 300 has manual fan control as I had one before my Strix 2 but I returned Helios because thing literally could not cool itself and throttled every 3 seconds. I believe that be an individual issue just like fans on Asus laptops simply being luck of draw.,0.096,0.774,0.13,0.8889,1

gh7ktd,ASUS,I just got an A15 a couple days ago. I only use it connected my TV as an HTPC and for living room gaming so I 't comment much on its suitability as an everyday laptop. That said my impressions are I think design looks nice and build quality is pretty good. keys and trackpad feel good me. screen is kinda washed out but considering insane amount of CPU and GPU power 're getting at this price point it's hard complain. feels lightweight considering how big it is. lid for screen looks pretty classy and it opens surprisingly little effort. cooling solution is good. Temperatures stay low and nothing throttles. could be quieter but could say that about any gaming laptop probably. I've never owned a gaming laptop before but I've been reading a lot of reviews. Using it in Silent mode often allow it completely stop fan and then it's obviously completely silent although when it does occasionally spin up it's kind of annoying. minimum fan speed is 2200 RPM which is audible and it has kind of a whine it. Depending on what 're doing fan also sometimes speed up and slow down and that's noticeable. I don't have much experience Windows laptops so I don't know this amount of noise is common. I think bottom line is 're looking for a laptop that's thin lightweight classy super-quiet and has a super-great screen get a MacBook. You're going be pretty disappointed this laptop. But A15 is pretty inexpensive it has lots of RAM and fast storage it's upgradeable it has probably best mobile CPU money buy right now it has a strong GPU and it has a nice keyboard and trackpad. So there are pros and cons. I think A15 is definitely a great value for sure though.,0.073,0.702,0.224,0.9948,1

BTW 's a remote possibility but it could be that old drive died and new drive was DOA two dead drives.

ggxiez,ASUS,Install drive as C under heat sink first install Windows. be boot drive going forward. Add second M.2 later and it be assigned D. You always go in and change or re-assign things later and there are ways know which is which from BIOS but it be a bit daunting trying figure it out. Motherboard manual also tell .

ggxiez,ASUS,M.2 slots are connected differently on motherboard. one between CPU and PCIe 16x is connected CPU directly and second M.2 slot is connected through Northbridge chip. got really high speed M.2 like 5000Mb/sec Sabrent drive might get better speed top M.2 slot than bottom M.2 slot.

ggxiez,ASUS,for those who read this in future it turns out - it doesnt matter since Corsair Force Series MP600 NVMe PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 I bought for it have their own heat sinks and so dont fit unless remove heatsink that comes motherboard... this didnt occur me until i was installing them. heatsink that came mobo is now in trashcan. Sidenote - M.2s do not come screws or little posts - they assume your motherboard provides those which this ASUS board did so I was fine but had a moment of panic when opening Corsairs. In addition answer i found is a little more complicated than I thought - M.2 next CPU is listed and 1 but it is only PCIe 4.0 have a 3rd gen chip otherwise it is 3.0 - M.2 heatsink next northbridge chipset labeled 2 in manual is 4.0 regardless of your CPU.

ggjlul,ASUS,Found this looking for a fix for my situation which is similar. I have AX89X and had it set up as a solo router for house for about a week. I ordered two of 86U routers try and set them up as AiMesh nodes help strengthen signal at either ends of house so AX89U would be in middle. Currently testing has only been use one 86U at a time. problem I’m experiencing is not initial set up. Link a node main router and devices connect and I’m getting great speeds through mesh. 86U node router at least once a day just say its offline. Pull power cord and put it back in a boom back working again. Or I have a device connected node and everything is working good and I put it down take dog for a walk when I come back I have a connection node router but no internet connection. Some time toggling devices wifi off and back on fix internet connection. Some times it requires restarting router through it doesn’t show as being offline fix it. Seems most times it is some but not all devices connected node that are having a problem. Last night I was watching a movie on my iPad which was connected node and half way through I had just lost my connection and had toggle wifi on and off get connection back. So while at first I thought it was it just couldn’t reconnection after sleeping I am having an issue an active connection. There shouldn’t be this much restarting toggling powering off get mesh work.

Out of box Armoury Crate software was saying one of its components needed an update. would download and install but update notification would still come back. wasn't really affecting anything so I left it alone. I tried undervolt using ThrottleStop but my settings were too aggressive causing an endless BSOD boot loop. Tried using built-in recovery partition but it got stuck in middle. I ended up wiping drive completely and starting over a bootable USB. After some initial trouble getting Armoury Crate and SSD cache set up properly it's been working fine - for most part. I love feel of keyboard hardware packs a punch and I achieve 4-5 hours of battery life in Silent mode doing basic tasks without an undervolt which is great for a laptop a high-power six-core CPU. Haven't done a ton of gaming yet but in Performance mode it has no problems maintaining a solid 144 fps in Doom 2016 at a mix of high and ultra settings. Temps seem stabilize in 70-75 range when fans ramp up which get a bit loud but this is a characteristic have expect from a thin and light gaming laptop. screen is amazing. You charge it via USB-C which be handy a bit of extra juice in a pinch. fact that it comes a 1 TB SSD out of box is nice and add more via a second M.2 slot. Note that standard 16 GB of RAM is soldered motherboard and runs only in single-channel mode. I would recommend ponying up another 60- 70 on a second 16 GB stick put in free available slot as 'll see a noticeable bump in CPU performance by moving dual channel. only thing about physical design that I really find negative is fact that WiFi card is also soldered motherboard. At least it's an Intel 9560 which is an excellent unit but moving up WiFi 6 later is out of question unless get an external dongle. Their decision do this on GU502GV is more baffling when consider that upgrade WiFi hardware in cheaper GA502DU which has a virtually identical form factor. Overall I'm satisfied it. At its current sale price of 1 450 as of this writing I think it's a bit overpriced but it comes back down 1 300 again I would say it's worth it.,0.073,0.82,0.107,0.949,1

ggdrme,ASUS,I have same constant issues my RGB lighting running a Crosshair VIII but I have a ROG Thor PSU G.Skill Trident Z Neo memory AMD Wraith CPU cooler and a Strix 2080 Super without keyboard and mouse. Lighting profile not sinking on startup so I actually have go into Armoury Crate get correct RGB kick in. Then MB not being recognized in armoury crate when I do but RGB changes. I tried deleting armoury crate try and fix issues but it seems there is a bug and it doesn’t get deleted all way. So when try reinstall armoury crate it does not install all way. No matter what I tried I could not get it reinstall. I literally had reinstall windows get armoury crate back on my system. So now I try avoid uninstalling armoury crate. From icue comment I actually think icue software makes issues worse because icue and aura are fighting over control of MB plus icue only recognizes your MB and none of other Asus parts so what’s point. I only have a Corsair K70 LUX so I just ended up deleting icue altogether. Unfortunately I still was having problems so I reinstalled windows again and did not install icue on fresh copy. Now I am actually thinking of getting a different keyboard so I actually use lighting and set macros. I was actually thinking of getting an aura sync keyboard and mouse so I it easy and just use one program control all RGB lighting. After reading your comments though it looks like still have use two different programs control all your stuff Scope and Spartha plus having issues on top of that. So I be staying away from buying a ROG mouse and keyboard and just go another direction. ’s shitty because there really isn’t much better out there then Corsair keyboards. Bottom line I love build quality of all of my ROG products but having constant software issues is just more and more disappointing because it seems like I spend more time trying get them work correctly over actually using them. Has me thinking twice about using them in future builds. I know it may be too much ask but I would really really just like have one program control everything. All lighting mouse profiles keyboard profiles...and actually have all of it work. You are also super right about shutdown white LED’s on motherboard and two on graphics card they could light up a runway which is completely unnecessary.

gg2xw7,ASUS,For one thing are best off buying a kit of 2 sticks of DDR so a 2x8GB kit 16GB as sticks are likely be better matched that way.

Third is that a 3200 rated kit have been tested at that speed on intel and is less likely run stable at that speed on AMD. So it run 3200 buy a 3400 kit.

gfd3r0,ASUS,So about two years ago I bought a vg278 144hz tn monitor within 2 months infamous fully white screen of death happened me. Because of life being busy at time I wasn't able rma it at and eventually just assumed monitor was out of warranty. So I switched back my old cheapo monitor and used it for 2 years while my asus vg278 sat IN THE BOX AND PACKAGED for 2 years. When I discovered that asus offers a 3 year warranty I hurried send it in for rma. Now this is where things get interesting. That monitor didn't have a single scratch ding or dent when I sent it in due it being in my closet packed and untouched for 2 years. I know I didn't scratch it within 2 months I used it. Now they're refusing fix my monitor over this scratch. thing that infuriates me most is that 1. scratch isn't from me I'm guessing its from shipping though monitor was packed good. 2. white screen of death is a known issue monitors and is NOT caused by a scratch anyway. So I did scratch monitor scratch isn't deep enough cause any damage much less white screen of death. What should I do now? How do I fight something like this? Theyre now asking that I pay MORE get it fixed than I did when I bought it.,0.112,0.852,0.036,-0.9549,-1

gduior,ASUS,Hi there thanks so much for reaching out our team and we're happy advise. Unfortunately standard ASUS warranty doesn't cover physical damages therefore warranty would've been voided.

Your serial number be found at bottom of unit right above barcode it is listed as S/N or SSN.,0.071,0.787,0.142,0.6975,1
gduior,ASUS,spill water on it in US might as well just buy a new one without accidental damage warranty. repair center won't repair only replace which means about 90% of MSRP quote and only get a refurbished unit and not a new one. other non water damages that don't touch mainboard would probably be 300-500,0.052,0.842,0.107,0.2617,1

Likely what happened was that Windows was still expecting your disks be connected IDE/RAID controller and tried communicate them but was failing. Somewhere along that chain of reboots it installed drivers for AHCI controller and was able boot again. To answer your question no it's unlikely that setting a BIOS password had anything do preventing Windows boot.

gb8kjy,ASUS,screen is lackluster do some photo/video color grading. At least according reviewers and considering they edit videos for a living that's a valuable spec them hence their harshness on displays/color accuracy. I think I saw a few reviews saying response time was pretty slow so top notch response time for FPS games hit Master in competitive 'll probably dislike this display. Thermals seem be average compared other mid-range gaming laptops. Nothing stands out good or bad which I think is fine. From what I've seen Strix comes single channel 8GB 2666MHz RAM. Not sure how that effects Intel processors unit but A15 comes dual channel 16GB 3200MHz. Another spec consider might be battery. A15 has 90Whr and Strix 66Whr. plan use your laptop for browsing/working for a while A15 might last a bit longer unplugged. Personally I went A17 17in version . Would have gone A15 but saw that 17in was in stock. I know I'm going be disappointed display because I really love responsive screens but value for 4800H battery size and RAM config made it worth it. I don't think I wait any longer for 4000 series as Lenovo upped their base 4600H Legion 5 model from 760 more than 1k. don't laptop now do as others are and wait it out for next 2-3 months.,0.051,0.843,0.106,0.9085,1

gavtqc,ASUS,502DU is a decent option as long as get it for less than 1 000. I got one when it was 900 a couple weeks ago. keyboard was one of best I've ever used and I've owned plenty of laptops. Out of box Performance and Turbo modes in Armoury Crate set CPU 100% performance at all times which caused idle temperatures hover in 55-60 degree range. Setting minimum 5% while plugged in or on battery dropped those readings a far more manageable 38-43. I disabled turbo boost on mine as I didn't encounter a situation where I felt it was necessary. newest game I tried play on it was Doom 2016 and Vulkan API it had no problems maintaining a 100 fps average at 1080p and high settings. stock WiFi card was horrendous but that was easy enough swap for an Intel AX200. You could go an Intel 9560 wanted save a few bucks - I've seen it as low as 10- 13 online. nbsp All this said I'm going be swapping out this system for GU502GV since Best Buy put it on sale for 1 300 as one of its daily deals and store nearest me has it in stock. better specifications 6-core CPU RTX GPU 1 TB SSD 144 Hz screen RGB keyboard are worth that much of a price premium.,0.045,0.841,0.114,0.9581,1

gq87e6,thinkpad,I use Windows on a desktop PC about 10 hours a day for development. All other things i do on my macbook. I love my macbook for non-work stuff. Media consumption writing taskmanagement and so on. whole MacOS user experience and a set of app that have no equivalent on any other OS. After a day on Windows it always feels like an escape. Hate keyboard so i use an external Magic Keyboard. During last 10 years i bought a few high-end Windows laptop Dell Vaio Toshiba see i get a feel for it and have a more mobile lifestyle. never satisfies me and quickly decide i cant work on it..i have about 10k worth of machines collecting dust around house. Last year i bought a Thinkpad Carbon X1. weight and keyboard and good deal made me pull trigger. I must say for first time i really enjoy working on a Windows laptop. 's so light sturdy fast and keyboard.... unfortunately it doesnt give me MacOS ecosystem but other than that its a delight work on. Tomorrow i have my Thunderbolt 3 dock delivered.. maybe im getting rid of good old desktop setup. x200B I dont understand why its popular recommend XPS Surfaces or Spectre's as macbook alternatives when people have a Carbon X1!,0.035,0.834,0.132,0.966,1

I was able install Office 97 and Photoshop 5.5 and get some real offline work done! Tried play games as well some like Midtown Madness 2 worked great others like NFS 2 SE and DOOM worked but in 256 color mode which is messed up in this generic driver. I wish there were a driver for ATi X1400 for Win9x but I wasn't able find any. Overall it was pretty fun one-time experience!

gqixxj,thinkpad,dont have any older thinkpad keyboard experience compare it x250 keyboard is simply great. And have worked older boards might simply prefer newer style its quite a personal thing its not like older boards are 100% better for 100% of all people all time. You should not let yourself be blinded by keyboard look at everything else these three models have offer and a decision based on that instead. x220 probably be cheapest and actually quite fast for money average below average battery life . x250 be a bit sluggish depending on what processor end up but good battery life and nice screen options out of box but also very sucky ones .

gqixxj,thinkpad,Is x250 a quality machine compared x220? Any handicaps that should be noted? I have both well it's a x230 . x230 feel sturdier than x250 but that's also because x250 is thinner which is probably what's giving me that impression. There's been some threads here that said x250/x260 suffers from bad internals eg. RAM module shifts when laptop is held on one end but I have not experienced this. x200B Is KB horrendous or meh or good for a modern KB? As I'm going be a student soon it's fairly important. has a nice travel it so it still feels tactile which is great for typing. I recently measured key size for another poster compared x250 vs x230 chicklet KB . size of lettenumber keys are same but other keys are smaller. spacing is also a little off. From Q P x250 KB was shorter by about 0.5inch. 're only using x250 'll get used it. My issue was that it's my only machine that has a newer keyboard so i still have mistypes when i use it.,0.082,0.798,0.12,0.7499,1
gqixxj,thinkpad,X250 or a T450s is what I would recommend not 2nd gen x1 carbon Lenovo kinda sh t bed its keyboard layout for that generation . keyboard be a change from x220 mostly just slicker keys and a bit less efficient layout.

gqm7ic,thinkpad,For me it is really hard compare these because despite being in same series these are all very different. I also don't dislike current models but I voted other for T450s as my favorite of T series. Why T450s? Well I had a T440s as my main machine which is basically same sans TrackPoint buttons . What I loved about this one is that design wise it is very similar regular T series – non-wedge design straight edges boxy look. That makes it unique among newer T4xxs since T460s switched an X1 Carbon inspired wedge-design. just oozes that classic ThinkPad feeling more but unlike regular T450 it has much better materials Magnesium base cover instead of plastic and it also has smaller bezels so it is more compact. also retains Powerbridge which was certainly nice have in pre-USB-C era. T440s and T450s along T440p also were first T ThinkPads since T60 feature an IPS screen. After so many shit screens it was a revelation.,0.036,0.763,0.201,0.9836,1

gqgoaw,thinkpad,I made switch from a Surface Book my current X1C5 a few years ago. primary reason for switch was fact that I simply 't live Windows and Thinkpad's generally have great Linux support but sum it all up Thinkpad comes out on top as better laptop by far in my opinion. Surface Book is cool but unless really detachable tablet as a feature I don't see a sensible reason buy one. Thinkpad wins in following areas for me - Better keyboard - Trackpoint - More durable - More servicable - Linux support - Much better IO - Much faster SSDs - Better WiFi Intel - Native ethernet - Integrated WWAN I use it so much! - Matte display - Lighter smaller and hinge is far better. Stiff no wobble and rotate a full 180 degrees. x200B Surface Book has a few things going for it though especially use your computer for media consumption primarily. - 3 2 aspect ratio - Better speakers - Detachable tablet and great pen support - dGPU optional in base x200B only thing I miss about Surface Book was fact that design was so unique and tactile feeling of detaching screen awesome click sound is artificial was so satisfying. In end though Thinkpad is much more comfortable use as a pure laptop. I feel Lenovo has pretty much perfected conventional laptop at this point and I don't really understand why people go for XPS's and Macbooks that give 2 USB-C ports and a headphone jack and that's it.,0.017,0.704,0.279,0.9975,1

Modern machines not allow component replacements like old ones did so as long as keep throwing new motherboards at a laptop could probably a modern thinkpad last 10 years but i dont think thats what are after here.

gqcqs3,thinkpad,T470s has a dual core cpu so it perform a lot worse than other options so eliminate that immediately unless 're looking for thin and light. I would go for T480 and I have a T460p. Both machines are roughly in same CPU performance class although T460p is a little faster. T460p also has better graphics and a better screen but this comes at expense of battery life. only has external battery vs internal and external on T480 and on top of that it uses more power because of H series cpu and dedicated GPU. Do not expect it it through a day on a charge extended battery. Also T480 is thinner lighter and it has a thunderbolt port. combination of weight thickness battery life and thunderbolt would push me T480 but YMMV.,0.016,0.906,0.078,0.7935,1

Click on 'Sdb1' which is only partition on drive and select 'change'. You select 'use this partition as Ext4 File System' some distributions such as Mint reqiure manually select 'format' at this point . Then set 'mount point' as '/' which is root file system and click OK. You be taken back previous menu and that partition have a tick next it. Now click on 'Sdb' just above that partition this selects it as device install . Now just below is an option for where bootloader is be installed. is VERY IMPORTANT that CHANGE THIS OPTION. THE BOOTLOADER MUST BE INSTALLED TO YOUR DEVICE listed as '/dev/Sdb'. do not do this bootloader be installed your internal drive.

Furthermore get SELinux built in which is one of few significant security mechanisms available for Linux today.

This way gaming aspect won't be portable but upgrade GPU whenever it and don't an expensive high-end laptop. Getting a machine actually meant for gaming would be cheaper though.

Some of them shipped Sandy-Bridge chips which always be swapped out for IB but my guess is it would limit speeds 1333 1600MHz could be wrong though no SB chip handy test .

gpsq29,thinkpad,So I see some suggestions for AMD powered E L and T series. While these are great general purpose laptops I use my E495 for programming and playing older games on low settings I worry that it may not be quite specs are in market for. For one thing video editing likely benefit from a dedicated GPU and possibly a more powerful CPU though that may be less necessary . Finding a laptop like that for around 1000 is going involve some other compromises. may be worth looking at Notebookcheck's list of budget multimedia laptops for some good examples. For another AMD models aren't typically given best displays. A 250 nit 1080p display is just fine for me but may something better quality. Third E495 that I have is pretty upgradeable and serviceable storage ram battery but more and more models are getting soldered RAM treatement especially premium T-series . Thinkpad most directly targeted for multimedia content generation would be X1 Extreme. They have a more powerful CPU and a dedicated GPU nice displays and are quite serviceable. 's a little more pricey but I've seen first generation ones selling for around 1500USD here in states. I don't know how much that would end up being for across pond or find a seller a good warranty but I suggest check that model out.,0.025,0.801,0.175,0.9858,1
gpsq29,thinkpad,I strongly suggest wait for AMD-powered L14 and L15. a new laptop ASAP maxxed out E495 and E595 should be within your price range E series are not as sturdily built hence my suggestion wait for L14 AMD and L15 AMD but they offer most performance for buck. Frankly speaking intended use for your new laptop is 50 tabs in a browser I strongly recommend switch Firefox video editing and video capture then I think almost any new ThinkPad except 11e series and maybe i3 models fare fine. Be prepared for suggestions strongly consider used T series laptops. However do intend buy a new ThinkPad specifically I'd recommend looking at L series - nowadays their quality got very close T series and they're cheaper.,0.0,0.856,0.144,0.9423,1

gpplyn,thinkpad,I would opt for Full HD. Don’t think ’ll get much from 4K on a 14” display besides battery drain. 4K display gives about 3-4 hours of use. FHD gives around 6-8. PPI from 1080p is already enough. I actually have raise font size on thinkorswim cause text be too small see. I ’t imagine 4K and wasted resources upscale. I save 4K for 32” and higher displays. I also run my X1 C7 2 x 27” ThinkVisions. Works great via USB-C.,0.039,0.871,0.09,0.6249,1
gpplyn,thinkpad,Please see my recent post about negatives of screens on X1 carbon. A lenovo sales person confirmed me that all 1080 FHD models of X1C8 are low-powered screens though configurations on website don't say it. You are most likely come across pretty bad ghosting issues this screen and I personally would avoid it like COVID-19. Face mask and everything. 4K is beautiful screen but yes glossy and yes drains battery about 60% running time of what FHD provide. 're okay less battery running time try a matte screen protector which significantly reduces gloss. Lenovo website says they release WQHD screen on X1C8 end of this month. I personally would get that and use screen calibration from notebookcheck.net it is indeed same 2019 WQHD which is more than likely hopefully fix some greenness/yelllowness issues of factory calibration. Otherwise they review it and provide calibration settings at some point. Or calibrate it yourself! x200B Also why not just get X1C7? Its exactly same except doesn't have extra logo on front and nearly half price RN and includes 10th gen CPU,0.02,0.865,0.114,0.95,1
gpplyn,thinkpad,I have UHD screen. Colors are beautiful text is very sharp and it is bright. However I find glossy screen more annoying than I thought I would.

gpqsei,thinkpad,1 I'm not sure sorry I don't own an X1G2 nor do I have an HDR display 2 3 When discrete GPU is enabled on a ThinkPad CPU doesn't enter lower C States . C States are modes in which CPU enters reduce power consumption and this really increase battery life and reduce temps. In my case CPU DGPU on idles at about 1 Watt of power whereas it disabled it idles at 0.5 Watts. This in my case reduces my battery life from 10 5 hours so be warned! I use an E490 a AMD GPU so while this might not be an issue Nvidia card have I did see C State issue reported X1 Carbon 6th gen which do use Nvidia cards. C State issue would also cause higher temps as putting more power in CPU would mean more heat is produced thus explaining higher temps. article below goes a little more in depth other battery saving measures try and compensate for having discrete graphics enabled I hope this helps!,0.027,0.899,0.075,0.7812,1
gpnr8d,thinkpad,That was one of sellers/items i considered when i upgraded mine IPS. Reasons I didn’t buy it • found a good deal on IPS screen 45 • that board is meant be placed behind LCD panel that’s what spacers are for . Some reviews said it was causing some flex on lcd panel. • i ended up getting board a longer cable which is meant for it go under keyboard 55 . I’ve been using this setup since beginning of this year and no flickering issues. Some reviews said that shorter cable “might” be one causing flickering issue. Not sure there’s any truth that. All i know is that i have longer cable and no flickering issues.

're wondering what TrackPoint is like compared Unicomp's non-strain gauge pointing sticks then I simply say this is definitely better it's missing some TrackPoint III and IV features . mouse buttons however are weak spot of design - they lack a bit too much tactility for my liking. In comparison Unicomp's mouse buttons are far better. case feels overtextured compared standard Model Ms just like my 2004 FRU IBM M13 On--Stick from Unicomp.

gplb64,thinkpad,I'm not sure. What I say is after 3 years my ThinkPad 13 R.I.P had only 3% battery degradation and definitely over 300 cycles .

Lenovo definitely changed something in how CPU/cooling behaves. 4. Using TP fan application change your fan speeds is not ideal solution. Basically have as much performance as low heat output and fan noise as possible. But TP fan won't let achieve it.

gp6uij,thinkpad,I have managed reduce overheating on a thinkpad t440p using thinkfan. After upgrading more powerful CPU i started get my laptop overheating. By tweaking thinkfan I have managed reduce temperature. I am using GNU/Linux its quite easy just read some tutorials how overs did it. Otherwise just look for more info on youtube or google it. Thinkpads are quite popular notebooks.,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.8548,1
gp6uij,thinkpad,Before do any of that take a look at your process manager. See what program is consuming so much CPU cause throttling. You might have some background process going on. 's strange me that have those issues because fan doesn't run on my X1 Carbon Gen 6 when watching YouTube. I have an i5 as well. Since did drop your laptop it might have misaligned your heatsinks so that's a possibility. But normally a laptop wouldn't repasting in just 2 years of usage address a big change in cooling like that. Something else is going on in my opinion but do simplest thing first which is see what program is causing this issue. Download HWinfo64 monitor temperatures and see when things start throttling. Taking apart Carbon Gen 6 is no joke from what I've researched. Be sure study hardware manual really well.,0.04,0.867,0.093,0.765,1

No idea how it compares vs AutoCAD. That being said I'd go for something a little better since it was a bit stuttery and it ran out of RAM any browser open. Maybe a 5th gen or something. Or maybe a laptop a dedicated GPU - I think AutoCAD actually uses those unlike SW. Also keep in mind that T440s and X240 both have a maximum of 8GB RAM per slot.

gp8kt3,thinkpad,I went from a 2011 MacBook Air an XPS 13 9360 an X230 an X270. I really liked XPS form factor but it didn't hold up well after 18 months. main issues were Awful coil whine. Poor thermals it gets quite hot fan runs often. Battery lost half its capacity and wasn't great begin since I got 4K screen. Adhesive on rubber rails on bottom failed and they came off. Soft touch material collects fingerprints / never looks clean. Stock wifi is awful on Linux and disconnects constantly.

DVD-RW and still not be sure what do. Sell it keep it and modify or just keep it original parts. Just modified bios so far and installed Intel 7260AC also 128GB m2 and 1TB 2.5 . Actually a really nice X230 but I have also T440p maxed out and X260 16GB 256GB SSD FHD which I got for 210 EUR.

gp8ajn,thinkpad,This depends on your personal moral compass. But it's hard buy a laptop that is not at least made in China brand is non-chinese.

I have no answer all this. is not easy.,0.184,0.816,0.0,-0.8566,-1
gp8ajn,thinkpad,Pretty much everything is made in China these days. Those things not made in China are likely made by poorly paid immigrants whether legal or illegal. That is true for products Made in USA . I 't speak about Lenovo but I know there are small businesses in China making high quality products in small quantities for niche markets and they probably have no ties Chinese government other than paying their taxes. I could be wrong about that though. US does not have clean hands when it comes intervention in affairs of other countries. We also have political prosecutions and political prisoners at both Federal and state levels. Look at case of Julian Assange. Look at Russiagate. Look at Charlottesville.

Some software tweaks rectify this and this a very competent little laptop! Davinci Resolve struggles 4K .H264 unoptimized footage but I use free version so that's all on CPU I don't know how enable GPU acceleration or whether in free version and I haven't tested other codecs yet like .MOV files which hopefully yield better results. battery also hits 10 hours on a charge without use of DGPU no more no less. Using laptop for gaming while on battery only it last about 2-3 hours however any program is using RX550X at all battery instantly go from 10 5 hours due CPU not entering power saving states although this also seems be an issue X1 Carbon as well .

gp10yk,thinkpad,For average consumer ThinkPads are better for their durability since they're business laptops - roll cages spill resistant keyboards and other cool features. You also purchase better support them than regular laptops and they might be easier get repaired down road. Saying that plenty of business laptop lines Latitude EliteBook maybe ZenBook and ThinkBook offer same thing. Plus some of them are still easily user-upgradeable which is something that ThinkPad has lost on a lot of its laptops. Anyway 're gonna look at ThinkPads as a consumer should look at these other options too. Honestly old ThinkPads were cool cuz could turn them into projects. new ones don't really have that anymore IMO. Just get whatever has features care about. like C930 I'd look at ThinkBook XPS Zenbook and Spectre as well. also keyboards are really good apparently and maybe like trackpoints? ,0.014,0.771,0.215,0.9826,1

gp10yk,thinkpad,Yes in general Thinkpads are better built have better input and better connectivity. These two equipments are no different.

For instance I spend most of my days typing so a good keyboard is really really important and I love Trackpoint. But this is not important for maybe don't X1.,0.036,0.612,0.353,0.985,1

gora74,thinkpad,I have a very good experience thinkpads. Abused them modified my t440p chassis jerry rig a full size m.2 ssd put a 17 inch screen on my t440s because it fell from a really high table and screen broke and blew up some fuses put solder in their place only for it continue working this day bought a full hd panel later for it . After all my non-quite-well-usage of my thinkpads NONE of them died every single one of them is a snappy little machine.

gora74,thinkpad,My X230 and X1 Extreme haven't had any issues so far.

A T470s I picked out for somebody hasn't run into any issues though there is a dented corner. A T440p I picked out for another guy i7-4900MQ ran hot and some of keys were a bit janky. got stolen because he left it in his car and didn't lock door. W540 I picked out as a replacement is only one that really gave me problems. With Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver it stutters like crazy. Had remove that driver.

gop304,thinkpad,4K panel be wonderful quality wise but kill battery very fast compared standard FHD panel. Should exchange T580 for T15? T580 is a very good device and not worse in a lot of ways compared T15. T15 does have better UHD screen option but FHD screens are about as crappy as they are on T580. T15 also offers AX Wi-Fi but a router compatible Wi-Fi 6 for that be an advantage. I think T15 has a nicer feel since its base is rubberized vs. rough plastic on T580 and it is noticeably lighter but there aren't that many more advantages.

goqqgo,thinkpad,First a heatsink would be designed / held by hardware for specific numbers separation and pressure between semiconductor and heatsink. That must be known long before anyone answer your question. Second most all heat transfers in direct CPU heatsink contact when using thermal compound. Compound only fills microscopic air gaps them thermally conductive. Thermal compound be ten or twenty times less conductive higher thermal resistance than what transfers most all heat - direct contact. So why add thermal compound? Only because others ordered do so? To increase CPU temperatures. To increase thermal resistance. Ignore any answer that does not discuss how this stuff works and numbers. Why replace a thermal pad? They do not go bad become less thermally conductive 20 year later constant use. Third considering thermal paste then always ignore any recommendation that does not discuss relevant specification numbers. A first number that only informed mention is watts per kelvin-meter. Anyone who does not discuss that first specification number always read datasheets is best ignored.

Several weeks later as shipping date was moving farther and farther out I decided cancel original laptop and order one that was in stock.

Lenovo put TWO pending charges for original laptop against my credit card during my phone call them cancelling order.

goez6o,thinkpad,I don't believe new L14 laptops have come out yet. I would wait until reviews are in until a decision. Right now would be buying blind as no one here knows since this is a new product. According this article new L14s come new AMD CPUs which according rumor are considerably faster than current top Intel CPUs. However 're probably on a budget so would have factor that into consideration. Has Lenovo given a price quote on L14s AMD CPUs? so is that price significantly different?,0.063,0.916,0.021,-0.5362,-1
goez6o,thinkpad,What's planned use for them?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
goez6o,thinkpad,Intel featuring L14 just became available in US AMD is yet follow in June. tech support videos are already out and base on those L14 is a very good pick for repair maintenance and upgrade. looks more of T490 than previous L model looks as it had a magnesium frame as well. Still there are no reviews yet so we don't know much on thermal design and display quality. As for your specs I would definitely buy AMD version it offers slightly more performance less power. That means less heat better battery life and more comfortable use on go. Also consider 16 GB RAM price difference is not that much and in a world where Chrome a dozen open tab eats 4 GB memory alone 8 GB soon be a bottleneck. Alas it's easy upgrade later as well. Thinkpads are in general long lasting and good quality but time time they have poor displays. 's not a problem for Word and Excel but is an issue for any graphic work. 300 nits HD screen likely be good but let's see.

Faster won't a difference on this Thinkpad but more is noticable. Most of time I use Timetec Hynix. Crucial is probably compatible but there are usually other choices available for less. I've only ever had one unexpected compatibility issue and it was Crucial. was when I was swapping memory around in 2 Thinkpads and a Thinkcentre tiny.

An issue I have my Dell XPS differences betweent i5 and i7 are not that big and usually barely noticeable. But since got this nice discount I would say go an i7 everything just a bit more future proof. But I would stay away from models v pro . That is a feature that only few people . difference between generations is also only a small improvement from one next but a 10th gen chip have better performance and battery life in comparison a 8th or 9th gen chip. One thing look out for in 10th gen chips is integrated graphics. chips that have a G1 or G7 G7 being better than G1 in their name have vastly improved graphics performance in comparison chips that have a U at their end. While cache is not as important as it used be general rule of thumb is more better. In general it is better have 2 sticks of 8GB for 16GB in total because then memory run in a dual channel mode. Giving better performance. x200B As for any recommendations Because a good screen and speakers I would suggest an X1 Extreme or a P1. These are fairly powerful machines 9th gen chips and have nvidia graphics chips for good performance or light gaming. But these are also fairly light and portable an okay battery life. On cheaper side a T15 is also a really good option. have maximum lightness and protability and don't a ton of graphics performance I recommend X1 Carbon. x200B I hope I was able give some insight!

gnb73a,thinkpad,In past I've only had an Desktop PC but for example for school I needed a Laptop. Thats why I've bought last week an ThinkPad T450. specs are i7-5600U 12GB RAM 512 GB SSD 1600x900 Display ThinkPad in general is in a very good condition. I think batteries are also still quite good. external battery has got 69 cycles and internal battery 14. While I tested it last days battery lasted about 8-9hr. I would have preffered an IPS Display but I've noticed that especially older ThinkPads IPS Displays seem be quite rare and also a bit pricy in Germany. I've paid 250€ for it. Other ThinkPads in that price range only had an 720p Display and had in general lower specs. Overall i'm very happy my purchase. 's really fast and working it makes a lot of fun.

gnae0f,thinkpad,I’ve been wanting get an old ThinkPad for a while and came across an out of business company auction lots of ThinkPads. Initially I wanted an X220 but prices went above what I was prepared spend. Instead I went for a X240 and won one of lots. listing was a bit of a mess description and pictures not matching so in week between auction ended and pickup I was very excited find out I had made a good deal or just wasted my money. In meantime while surfing local classifieds for spareparts etc. as one do I came across a very reasonably priced X201 that I couldn't resist. 4 GB ram i5 processor battery seems decent and very little wear outside. keyboard is great and I love look of no trackpad. day came that I could pick up X240 and my suspicion towards listing turned out be justified. First of all HDD was 250 GB instead of 320 GB. No big deal 's getting swapped an SSD anyway. Instead of pictured 3-cell battery it came a 6-cell battery. Great! Unfortunately battery was DOA giving replace due normal wear warning in Windows and only maintaining a voltage of about 5v. internal battery appears be in decent condition and cosmetically laptop is fine. All in all a fun experience would probably be more critical towards listing another time. Next up both are getting new SSDs and I also have a new original battery in mail for X240. I plan on running a light linux distro possibly Lubuntu on X201 and dualboot Windows and maybe Fedora on X240. Both are also going get a thorough cleaning and get their CPUs repasted. In future I might upgrade RAM on X201 X240 is already maxed out at 8 GB. Ideally I would like get a new battery for X201 but I don't feel like entering 3rd party battery lottery and an original battery would cost me several times price I paid for laptop. Down road I might look into upgrading display and trackpad on X240 but for one I'm just going enjoy spending some time fixing up these fine machines.

gnswyv,thinkpad,compatibility of fans and heatsinks between different laptop models is very very low because in most cases these are custom parts designed fit a particular model and its variants.

There are some tweaks that one fan more quiet than others but when staying within same physical dimensions and performance amount of air moved differences in noise be small any. Now your current fan is broken mechanical like rattling and scraping sounds then replacing it a fresh one at least remove those sounds giving an overall better experience. Also some brands just a shittier product than others resulting in more of these noises being produced on side on a new sample google about different brands and how users generally experience sounds they produce.

They are a tad heavier but tactile bump is very close what a T25 feels like. replicate key travel of a T25 try using two 2 mm thickness o-rings on each keycap. reduces key travel quite a bit but still leaves a nice tactile bump.

gmvp8p,thinkpad,In My opinion t470p bcoz it have a better cpu And dual chanel,0.0,0.791,0.209,0.4404,1
gmvp8p,thinkpad,two laptops couldn't be more different. T470p notice p at end is a workstation meant for sustained workloads rendering etc . X280 is an ultra portable smaller screen and emphasis on battery life and non-sustained loads. Things in common 1. Both have 4 core CPUs 2. Both run linux fine only fingerprint sensors are not supported That's it. What is different 1. T470p has a proper 35W CPU 4c 8threads that run at full speed for a long time at a huge expense battery life so expected work mostly plugged in or on dock . 2. x280 has a 15W CPU 4c 8threads that car run at full speed briefly and then settles lower clocks avoid overheating. is still plenty fast for common use. 3. T470p has a 14 in screen x280 only 12 inch. 've never used a 12 inch before expect everything be small. Or large expect have very little real estate open more than one window at a time. x280 has 1360x768 screen just walk away or be prepared upgrade not trivial . T470p comes a base FHD screen. 4. T470p has a 2.5 in bay for it's main drive. This be a 2.5 SATA SSD or a 2.5 HDD or an adapter a 2280 NVMe SSD limited 2x PCI lanes. one buy has either for former two also buy an adapter upgrade NVMe. 5. x280 only has a 2280 drive either SATA base model or NVMe SSD. 6. RAM on T470p is fully upgradable 2 slots. 7. X280 has soldered RAM what buy is what 're stuck . 8. X280 has a USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port. T470p has none. 9. T470p has a removable battery. small one lasts about 2.5 hours bigger one about 6hours. X280's battery is not removable and lastas around 8 hours for same use light browsing . 10. T470p has probably discrete GPU. Works fine in linux. X280 only has iGPU. Do dGPU not unless plan on doing some 3D or other compute tasks or light gaming but plan on gaming don't buy a thinkpad . So see what kind of use case 've got and decision should be as clear as huge differences between two laptops. As for battery going bad keep charger on answer is most probably . You replace battery of X280 it's a tiny bit more involving. But minimise effects of constant charging by setting thresholds. I hope this helps. P.S. IF 're buying used sure there are no BIos passwords as they are unknown there is no way reset them.,0.043,0.899,0.058,0.7274,1

gml071,thinkpad,Let's see... Then I found out that sometimes because of course only sometimes internal HDD caddy doesn't get seen and I have reboot it often twice before it sees it again. Well there's no caddy for internal disk - only a bracket. Disk itself is connected directly motherboard. This issue be triggered by either motherboard or disk most likely overheating . I had a problem T430 in past that disk was malfunctioning and as result it was not detected by system. After cleaning device and replacing thermal paste issue was no longer present. In your case your disk may be culprit. Oh and when install it into Ultra Dock there's a horrible coil whine. This looks like a disk or caddy problem. I have been using second disk adapter official one for years and I never had such an issue. Oh and play games newer than 2005 then it throttle GPU heavily after approx 30 sec of playing and get 10FPS. Have changed thermal paste and cleaned cooling assembly? Want replace WiFi chip? Can't! Because it's whitelisted! There was also a whitelist on your T530. Are all modern laptops incompetent? Aren't there any true workstation ThinkPads that DON'T throttle? I don't a thin laptop I a FUNCTIONING laptop! There are devices which do not throttle - such as this one check graph in Processor section . 's not a workstation but still... Majority of devices are not designed sustain prolonged boost clocks and after few seconds CPU reduces working frequency. In past vendors tried keep maximum boost clocks while now they are trying keep base clocks. Personally I also have same issue right now. I am looking change my T540p something newer but it is more likely not be a ThinkPad. I have observed that Quadro cards installed in workstations have a tendency fail after about three years. Current ThinkPads have only soldered GPUs so they die and 're out of warranty then buy a new device. You may ask what are choices then? Actually there are three Get longest possible warranty your device and try guess would more powerful GPU in future as cannot change it later. Buy a device Thunderbolt 3 port and no dGPU. For gaming buy an eGPU enclosure and desktop grade GPU later. This solution looks nice on paper but life is not so easy... Buy a device replaceable dGPU. last option requires a bit more comment. There are mobile workstations replaceable dGPUs - Dell and HP have them in their current porfolio. In past Lenovo had some of them too but they started solder everything starting from 2018 generation - last one replaceable GPU was P71. Personally I'm looking for either Dell Precision 7530 or 7540 as they are only 15.6 devices replaceable GPUs. Other options - Dell Precision 7730 7740 and HP ZBook 17 G5 and G6 are 17.3 . 7530 and 7540 have some issues/limitations thought Only 2x TB3 and 2x USB-A ports. 2.5 SATA port is available only as an option - order device HDD disk as otherwise won't get it. dGPU uses proprietary connector so cannot upgrade it outside Dell. You still install 7540's dGPUs in 7530 but it requires additional steps get drivers work. There's a lot of odd configurations on market poorest screen no camera or no antennas for LTE module so it's hard find a decent one. Dell warranty is calculated from production date not bought date. There is no problem find not used devices half of original warranty time. I'm still waiting my decision as Lenovo plans release T15p which seems be a successor of T540p which I am currently using .

gmocgw,thinkpad,Dual booting should not affect performance unless drive gets significantly full due having two systems on it plus a bunch of data games etc. As far as DB vs VM it depends on your workflow. use a lot of windows exclusive programs are better suited either running windows exclusively or running a VM on Linux. I would research GPU passthrough for this purpose it seems be a lot easier these days than on early 2010s when I first attempted do so and failed. A YouTuber I follow does it incredible success but his workstation is beyond powerful. Also are gonna use setup while on battery? so probably just stick windows. Linux is already a bit inefficient battery and a VM on top of it would kill your mobility. most use is done while plugged in it should be fine.

gmktj6,thinkpad,SSD is replaceable RAM is soldered. Agreed that price markup is insane on standard Lenovo website but occasionally get good sales and value through resellers. I paid close 1K for base version i5 8GB/256GB FHD . was through an industrial reseller for work but I wouldn’t be surprised could find it for similar as a commercial user. I imagine upgrading RAM shouldn’t be too much more and easily upgrade SSD 1 TB I did this myself I’m a big fan of X1Y4. I love metal chassis it does feel very durable. I took it home from work for quarantine and it’s been my main machine both at desk plugged in w monitor and also lounging on couch in tent/tablet mode. At work I used take it back and forth machine shop and other places no issues. A standard thinkpad would have picked up all sorts of grease on exteriopalm rest but this has stayed clean which I really love. Compared a standard X series it is more “premium” so expect pay for that. better value definitely go for L14 yoga or X13 yoga coming out soon but again avoid Lenovo website unless there’s a big sale,0.044,0.758,0.198,0.9883,1

gmcg9k,thinkpad,X240s and newer are fine especially portability - people just like hating on new things and this set of laptops was a different chassis from X230 and its predecessors which people liked a lot . didn't help that X240 which kicked off its series was missing physical trackpad buttons and maxed at 8GB RAM both of which were changed in X250 and newer . Since your budget is fairly low it's a good idea go for used/refurb laptops - something like an X200-series ThinkPad or an 820-series Elitebook or a E5200/E7200-series Latitude. All of these are business-style laptops which have an abundance of parts like projects right? and should be easy work on. These are all also 12.5 laptops though could go for 830 Elitebooks or E5300/E7300 Latitudes something bigger. I also mention that since were satisfied your i7-7500U I would say any i5 or i7 between around 2013-2017 should be fine for as well - this means anything from Intel's 4000 7000 series. There isn't a huge difference between these since they're all just 2 core 4 thread CPUs more and more efficiency could go older than this but starting from X240 do get a fairly big improvement in battery life partly from efficiency increase. Also every new generation came a better integrated GPU which may improve day--day performance a little so I wouldn't go too far from 7000 series. That being said pretty much any i5 or i7 is guaranteed be a marked performance increase from your Core 2 Duo and between 2011-2017 there were no significant improvements in CPU tech - it's only until Intel 8th gen came out when they were actually better i5s and i7s became 4 cores . really a zippy laptop put in a good SSD clean install Windows and don't run startup programs don't . SSDs are extremely underrated in performance - they get your boot times down 20s on a bad computer and 8s on a good one and just day--day usage a lot better for less than what a better CPU would cost. Keep in mind that in a lot of these old ish business laptops RAM and SSDs are really fucking easy upgrade so try not worry about those too much. Also get 1080p screen. At 12.5 a higher resolution give nothing but I have 768p screen on my X240 and it sucks. ,0.045,0.766,0.189,0.9955,1

Other security fixes were implemented in newer drivers but they don't seem cause much of an impact in my benchmarking runs.

Performance-wise I could not see much of a difference between i7-6700HQ and i7-9750H. But more or less this was expected based on reviews I had swallowed before ThinkPad buy. disappointment X1E2 was on bad thermals and resulting throttling despite under-voltage.

glzgg0,thinkpad,I’ve been thinking long and hard about this. I realize i a 16 10 screen but pass on DELL because of following reasons. Looks DELL just looks too flashy/toyish. I prefer nononsense industrial design on thinkpad. Keyboard/trackpoint Haven’t tested Keyboard on new XPS but DELL has never done a great keyboard in my opinion. I’ve tried several Latitudes and previous generation XPS. Didn’t care for them. Very mushy. Ports Nothing say really. Thinkpad wins. Dongles not an option for me. Macbook nonsense.

But I also managed get a reasonable discount by stacking a perks-at-work and UK holiday discount. keyboard ports and general build quality I hope swung it in Thinkpad's favour. keyboard was biggest factor. stronger CPU in Dell or any later X1E gen 3 refresh was not a huge issue because neither would compare Ryzen 3900X of my desktop.

I haven't had any issues mine and I'm currently connected two fhd displays one 144hz over displayport a usb-c displayport alternate mode adapter and other 60hz over hdmi on my coronavirus refugee workstation. 're going use 'all things all time' then external GPU however many monitors is answer run out of available bandwidth have multiple 5k 16 9 mind not dual qhd displays that are 5k or 6k monitors connected however at that point probably already know this. External GPU's give an abundance in monitor choice. I've run triple external monitors on mine no eGPU 2x4K 60hz 1xFHD 60hz and without a Thunderbolt 3 Dock Gen2 135W This is dock get actual part number varies by your geographical area . dock is nice have less cables sticking out from laptop directly and stay within limits it sets. You should be able run 3 4K displays ports available on laptop. I would recommend against miracast it be performing well. use wifi while using miracast performance be worse it have split time it uses for miracast and wifi.

gl7hug,thinkpad,'s a sad day. These machines were absolute beasts and still are. I have purchased every new thinkpad since 1999 and still buy them as they come out for our team but none has lasted as long and as well as T420. We all use T470 for our daily now but T420 has been serving in backup capacity for half of my team for two years now. No wonder they modeled anniversary edition after it. I kept one for myself but our recent office space being downsized due covid storage has become scarce.

Mounting a desktop cooler would be cool but it would be a lot of effort since 'd have come up a structurally sound way do it. I'd say just repaste improve thermals. That being said I don't think there's such a thing as a fan whitelist so should be fine in terms of that and weren't could always just find a different way plug a 12V 120mm fan in. I'd also like mention that an i5-8250U won't be leaps and bounds over an i5-2400 unless he's relying on i5-2400 iGPU. Because of core configs 4c8t vs 4c4t and potential thermal differences I think upgrade would be around same as swapping his i5 an i7-3770 and a decent cooler.

glk9po,thinkpad,My main concern is whether windows 7 pro is any good compared windows 10 pro my current laptop is running. I found buy windows 10 online for pretty cheap I did a quick google shopping search and found windows 10 pro license key for anywhere from 5 20 license key gets actual operating system right? and I found a windows 10 pro DVD-rom for 40 maybe I could find it cheaper I shop around . -- Don't bother licenses. Thinkpads have a Windows licence embedded in their BIOS so no buy one. Download Win 10 directly from Microsoft website and install it During installation process once connected network WIFI or LAN it check embedded licence verify it and attach a digital licence motherboard ID so no more licence requested for any further installation of Win10 do on this laptop . Just in case Windows installation ask for licence number preemptively read/get embedded licence number from a Linux Live CD/USB like Ubuntu live try by typing this command in a terminal sudo cat /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM But usually Windows 10 installation read licence directly from bios on Thinkpads models xx40 in 2014 and after. source Note I've installed no later than this week Windows 10 on a Thinkpad Yoga S1 for a family member this Thinkpad embed a Win8.1Pro license which is automatically recognized and validated by Win10 installation process .,0.038,0.878,0.084,0.8094,1

T series which have long been known for it's updaradabiliy and/or maintenancebility? You must be joking because eVeRyOnE wAnT tHeM tO bE tHiN aNd LiGhT. I mean just look at T490 and T490s. s is thinner and lighter so it shouldn't have any ram slots and hence I could charge all sweet sweet ram taxes when order machine. Non-s is heavier and cheaper so got use plastic track pads and glass fiber shells instead of glass trackpads and magnesium shells. Oh right don't assume could get a larger battery just because it's a heavier model because iT's ChEaPeR. With these compromises what do we gain? ONE SODIMM SLOT. Anyway I'm just regretting my investment in my T480. Not because several cons that I don't detail here but Lenovo just don't give true thinkpad users/fans a fuck and keep treating them like trash.

However HHKB has an unusual layout. isn't a normal format and isn't a TKL. Personally I think I would hate that layout. 's too heavy be really portable and too compromised in layout match productivity of a traditional layout. You might consider Realforce R2 newer version than mine which has same submlime switches but in a regular TKL layout.,0.035,0.914,0.051,0.2805,1

This allow your GPU throttle at 74 degrees C instead of original 56 degrees C and it get rid of random CPU throttling 0 2Ghz stupid Lenovo . 2. Install Throttlestop undervolt and limit boost 2 4GHz. This allow your GPU take a bigger portion of your thermal budget. 3. Contrary manual do not overclock GPU changing settings seems mess things up and it is not worth go through pain for few more FPS. Yesterday I spend 6h playing GTA V on my T490 MX250. 1080p Medium settings TAA enabled.

gl7ol0,thinkpad,I had this ThinkPad T490s for a month now and I realised it makes pop sounds when something changes in screen.

I switched back Windows 10 and pops are still there no matter what I do at a software and firmware level. Is this a technopop variance of coil whine? it is well that's it but I'm afraid of it being a faulty capacitor about explode or a badly soldered something making bad contact. fact that most of times it obeys changes on screen makes me think it's not serious but sometimes it pops just because.

glaa6m,thinkpad,Lenovo X1 Extreme thermal throttling solution Undervolt i7 8750H and OC Scan Nvidia 1050ti I took up an X1 Extreme for weeks of testing and configuring. There are two adjustments which this ultra-book significantly faster and cooler. I do not recommend repasting its just nonsensical. There are only two basic changes made significant temp decrease and benchmark increase. Note X1 Extreme's Core i7-8750H is benchmarking in top 89% of ALL processors. Which means this X1 Extreme I configured runs faster than nearly 90% of all DELL MAC ETC other systems/configurations this same processor. Here are result steps below. Cinebench R15 score 1178 up from 966 . Lenovo 20MF000BUS - UserBenchmarks Game 39% Desk 108% Work 79% Full Result Intel Core i7-8750H Nvidia GTX 1050-Ti Mobile Max-Q SSD WDC PC SN720 SDAQNTW-512G-1001 512GB RAM Samsung M471A2K43CB1-CTD 1x16GB Quick context - i7 8750H is incredibly powerful. To access full power of SIX cores system must stay cool. Lenovo's cooling system outperforms Dell and HP in testing and significantly outperforms Mac Book Pro. So its already just about as fast as get in a light thin laptop- but its going get hot when running all that power. steps below help keep your processor running at full potential - its a safe and sound no chance of harm. two-step process must be performed in this order Start by turning off Lenovo intelligent cooling and set button performance. Also set your power mode Best Performance. 1 OPEN MSI Afterburner and RUN OC SCAN This is new tech on latest GPUs. This automatically run and adjust clock speeds while also undervolting your Nvidia GPU its max stable state. This greatly reduce GPU temps and improve framerates. also allow your CPU run faster when both GPU and CPU are under load gaming etc because it not be drawing as much power away and generate less heat - leading NO thermal throttling. Your system is smart it protects itself. NOTE This automatic process not change memory speed slider do that manually after. Slide it up 450Mhz for safe and sound performance. Save this profile and lets move on. 2 OPEN Intel XTU safely and securely undervolt. A child could do this. First please forget or ignore all bloat may have read posted by extreme tuners which overcomplicate. Forget about throttlestop. Some people are trying change their processor too much - trust me uber science nerds at Intel thought of all this already millions in research and development. I doubt balance needs of your processor better... ONLY reason we improve performance here is because we know one thing that Intel did not know when they made processor. Intel does not know what laptop their processor is going end up in. has work in a Mac Book or a Dell etc. different specs and cooling. We do know that this processor is incredibly consistent. Meaning they nearly all undervolt same way. Totally safe Intel's official XTU app gives only settings adjust your i7 your unique system. Configure your X1 Extreme as follows Open XTU app and simply slide slider labeled Core Voltage Offset down -0.150 V You are done. like add additional performance safely by also moving turbo boost power max up 75.000W for both short and max. Your X1 not allow add too much power. Sliding this up is removing any software handicap - processor still limit power per intel specs. Your X1 like your car is monitoring itself and has hard limits which not be changed by a slider bar duh. Make sure apply changes close and restart. Open app on restart and confirm values are set. Expect see large gains in frames games benchmarks and everyday processing. Anything beyond this is splitting hairs. Would like conclude a final word on this system. In my research I have seen post complaining about X1 temp and thermal throttling etc. Some folks report that they retuned system.. imagine frustration only find that ALL ultra-books get hot under load. To be clear - do not change anything about this machine - it is a beast out of box and temps are outstanding for an ultra book. Its never hot unless gaming and when under load really not do better without defying laws of physics. I sometimes wonder commenters understand that actual electric is running through system and a lot of it. Touch a 15W light after an hour. Here we have 45 W in a chip size of your thumb. Fire. Hot. Mac Book Pro prefer slow and cool - Lastly kindly note that watch HD movies in bed then buy an iPad. This is professional machine serious power - outperforms pretty much any other laptop on market and most desktops. All best!,0.046,0.802,0.152,0.9983,1
glaa6m,thinkpad,There's definitely a lot more room for improvement throttlestop. Sure XTU may be simple but throttlestop give better results know what undervolt. You undervolt your CPU cache and Intel GPU at least -100mV.,0.0,0.747,0.253,0.8167,1
glaa6m,thinkpad,Your comment on Intel doesn't know what laptop their processor is going end up in isn't reason undervolt CPUs. CPU Dies are manufactured in large quantities and have varying performance. For example Ryzen 1700x and 1700 are exactly same circuit and come from same batch. Some of 1700 chips could reach a higher clockspeeds than others in testing and they get branded 1700xs and ones that cannot get branded 1700s. reason we undervolt 8750h is because Intel has provide enough power for lowest denominator in a batch work at a set frequency. This gives a large room for tuning didn't get unlucky in silicone lottery ,0.025,0.964,0.011,-0.3612,-1
glaa6m,thinkpad,Does anyone else get BSODs when trying run OC Scanner?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
glaa6m,thinkpad,gains are substantial. CPU is able run at higher frequencies while Gpu under load and GPU is able maintain max frequency without throttling down. Plus get a GPU overlock. Under full load GPU temps hit only 60-61c - down from 76-80c. In terms of a real life example - I found low frames using Just Cause 4 at low settings during test and also universe sandbox slowing down simulation substantially after short time. As expected checked monitors and thermal throttling was clocking everything down. Controlling heat in an X1 means addressing two major sources. After GPU AND CPU undervolt I report 60 frames in Just Cause at High settings and Universe sandbox is able fully tax all 6 cores at 3.9ghz for hours of duration without simulation slowing down at all. So I would say both on paper and real world these changes together are substantial.,0.03,0.928,0.042,0.2023,1

gl1b2g,thinkpad,I have a T470 as my daily driver upgraded from a mid-2012 macbook pro. 's about 10% faster in terms of CPU graphics are a lot better I play SC2 on medium settings at 45fps instead of low at 10fps. I don't do too many intensive things other than compile code which is a bit slow. I would not recommend going for anything less than a T470. I turned off intelligent cooling option which seemed speed things up a little at expense of having fans on more often. I got mine 16GB of ram an SSD and a high dpi display video editing uses a lot of ram so I would recommend getting a ram upgrade and using an SSD your budget handle it. I'm using free calibration display settings from notebookcheck and it removed blue cast I was getting and it looks much more correct . This might be important when video editing as colors are important. However srgb production in general is pretty poor so 'd be better off doing it on an external monitor colors are especially important. I never used a T460 so I 't comment on it unfortunately.,0.061,0.819,0.12,0.8828,1
gl1b2g,thinkpad,I have a T460 my wife has a T470. I think there won't be any difference in speed are only considering cheapest t470 configurations an i5 CPU. They'll probably have same CPU 6300u . However T470 has USB-c so I would go t470 have a more future proof laptop. Regarding keyboards keys on T460 have a longer travel distance. T460's keys almost feel like a desktop whereas one on T470 is a very good and comfortable laptop keyboard. I think both are beautiful it comes down what one prefers. I feel like I am faster on T470 probably because key travel distance. I add one personal experience regarding keyboard of T460. I write a lot each day alternating between T460 and different desktop keyboards MS Sculpt Ergonomic Sculpt Comfort and Sculpt Mobile . I think typing on T460's keys is most enjoyable great feeling and key click sound . However keys are harder and I get tired faster on T460's keyboard. But that might be only me. So despite my enjoyment of T460's keyboard I would choose T470 I had pick between two today.,0.033,0.821,0.146,0.963,1

gl3p6b,thinkpad,X230's had two screens both were 1366x768. difference was type of panel TN for terrible viewing angles/contrast/color and IPS for basically exact opposite. As for T480 stock screen is lackluster in terms of its coverage of srgb colorspace making it look lifeless. A replacement screen is easy drop in and there are many choices. find them low power IPS displays used in T490 X1C 6/7 series are drop in replacements provided they have four mounting tabs needed secure display lid two on top two on bottom . Here are your paths consider best color but a severe hit battery life theres some very nice 4k screens out there. better res great color and brightness 1440p hdr screens are nice. what I have my T480 went from 10 8hr max typical iirc. conserve battery and get best colocontrast ratio possible a low power screen like B140han05.7 would be best choice imo. Screen Suggestions 4k - BOE NV140QUM-N53 16.7m colors 1500 1 contrast ratio 500 nits brightness not sure on install 1440p - JDI LPM140M420 what I have in my T480 and X1Y3 or AUO B140QAN2.0 16.7m colors 1500 1 contrast ratio 500 nits brightness. JDI Requires WQHD cable brackets and WQHD lid fit. Swapped all these over works great needed some spacers keep this slightly smaller screen in place. Good double sided tape would likely have worked as well. Not sure about AUO screen. 1080p - B140HAN05.7 16.7m colors 1700 1 contrast ratio 400 nits brightness in my X1C7 confirm nice display Great display cannot confirm versions are available mounting tabs or not. Alternative option B140HAN01.2 or B140HAN 01.3 16.7m colors 800 1 contrast ratio 300 nits brightness. A truly drop in replacement no modding required has mounting tabs better than N140HCE everyone seems reccomend as it has a more shades of color think larger crayon box vs smaller Where get them? Ebay just sure have an explicit understanding from seller that are getting that exact screen. Return policies are nice as well.

gky1nj,thinkpad,E series is a good budget option IMO. My thoughts on specs Windows 10 is very slow on HDD especially on a 5400RPM laptop HDD. Unless are planning or are okay using Linux I wouldn't recommend using HDD for a system drive. Like said could always upgrade SSD later but be prepared that Windows 10 be slow before upgrade. Also possible I would avoid getting model dedicated graphics card unless are planning play games on it. Still AMD RX 640 is pretty slow and could probably only run less demanding 3D games.,0.062,0.751,0.187,0.9124,1
gky1nj,thinkpad,I played around an E490s we bought for one of our employees and was impressed overall look and feel. E15 looks like it shares a lot of same design elements so it should be a pretty nice laptop. I would definitely sure get 250-nit IPS display. still won't be a great screen but it looks like a pretty cheap upgrade and be much better. Aside from using an SSD boot drive which it looks like 're planning add yourself from comments this would be a high priority spec for me. be more impactful in daily usability than difference between an i5 and an i7. In fact I would strongly consider i5 save a few bucks and have option fully customize. real-world performance difference is pretty minimal and certainly not worth price IMO. 900USD actually isn't a bad price as that's what your configuration is going for right now on US Lenovo site.,0.024,0.709,0.267,0.99,1

gkw8ap,thinkpad,X2xx series are small and light not too bad work on either in my opinion. For example I have an X240 which I fitted -240GB SSD -Backlit keyboard -X250 Trackpad -8GB RAM -FHD 1920x1080 IPS panel All of those parts were under 40/ 40/ €40 and all add up a big difference. I then happened across an X260 i5-6300 motherboard and fitted that and it runs much cooler and efficient. I have tried a few Debian/Ubuntu distros and they all run great. Pop! OS seems have best battery life for me System76 Power Extension probably because its developed their own range of laptops in mind Overall I would recommend newest/powerful model CPU combo afford while leaving enough money for upgrades. use standard slim 68 24Wh battery then they weigh under three pounds! only thing I would warn against is keyboards are a little small and I see why people feel they are too cramped but its my daily driver now and i am always getting 6-7 hours out of mine stock batteries they have option of an internal battery for hot-swapping external ones and I usually have a second battery in my bag as well.

gkw8ap,thinkpad,I'm a comp sci student looking buy a new laptop and I heard Thinkpads were pretty good. Yea they're pretty good though in realm of Business Laptops they're not undisputed king. Latitudes and Elitebooks should also be considered. Which is best comes down personal preference I find that HPs have more vibrant displays Thinkpads have excellent color accuracy and decent keyboards for a laptop and Latitudes are well balanced. issue I have right now is that there are so many options for Thinkpads that I feel kind of lost. T460s. needs have a good enough battery last me through day and it also needs be sturdy enough handle my daily abuse I tend handle my laptops quite roughly T460s. Although may be coming home both batteries at 5% battery life is Good not Great . I plan on using this for many years come and so having it be future proof is a must. Future proofing is a myth. By time have latest CPU 've already been outpaced by another one. Buy used machines every three years 'll be a lot happier. I enjoy being able rip things apart and tinker them mostly cause I tend break them a lot and so it'd be nice that's possible as well. Good news Thinkpads be taken apart. Business IT wouldn't have it any other way. Bad news modding eh not most brilliant idea. 's usually better leave things stock and just buy something newer or better equipped out of box or at most swap display A for display B which was also available on your model year. Keyboard/Trackpad mods aren't a terrible idea not great but not terrible but anything more extreme is a no-no-no-no. Since I plan on carrying this around me daily a lighter option would be nice. T460s. X-series is alright 're okay 12.5 screens OR soldered RAM depending on take X1 or X2xx route. I don't know this makes a difference but I also plan on throwing Linux on device minute I get it. Not really. Just get your drivers squared away bad drivers cause infinite pain linux. SUGGESTIONS market's not super great right now so these prices I give might be a bit out of date. Welcome Safer at Home pricing. Less than 200 T450/450s I guess. Cheap but don't get NVMe or DDR4. From 200-300 T460s. most underrated T-Series laptop ever. Gets DDR4 RAM and NVMe on all four PCIe lanes. X260/270 Good like 12.5 displays and are alright having your NVMe drives limited 2 lanes. From 300-450 T470s Better battery than T460s thanks more efficient CPU. Said CPU isn't a major upgrade in any other regard. A485 Good a bit of graphics horsepower on go for your Minecraft addiction. No PCIe 3.0 x4 for NVMe. From 450-600 T480 Intel version of A485. Note don't get four lanes on NVMe but get a power efficient quad core making around 30% more power than A485 and 200% power of T460s.

gkmhkj,thinkpad,I thought about a very similar project for T460p/T470p a T480p of sorts. BIOS would be modified right ME firmware version as newer versions security fixes prevent this mod from working. My understanding is that Skylake ThinkPads use Bootguard prevent a modified BIOS from booting but skyra1n works around that. I noticed these CPUs aren't configured follow their TDP specifications at all in other notebooks so running them at higher power limits might be necessary for best performance. anemic heatsink and power delivery of T460p/T470p was what really killed project on my end but P50 should be able better handle heat of a hexcore Coffee Lake. I don't know it is possible for power stages be upgraded them run cooler like on T440p so 'll check out VRM when get your P50.

gkmhkj,thinkpad,This is what I generally call A REALLY BAD IDEA . x200B Why? Why do do this over just buying a P52 an 8750H already inside? What justifies jerry-rigging involved and a likely unstable laptop at end of it all? This makes no sense I cannot fathom a single reason do this. Coffee Lake CPU into a Skylake Motherboard Z370 Z170.. etc That's an enthusiast-grade motherboard not a custom designed one designed around power limitations and space constraints of laptops as well as only being on one CPU architecture Skylake. While it's true Skylake and Coffee Lake are fairly similar it's unreasonable assume they use same microcode. They don't. At all. What I am interested in and wondering about is someone like klem would be able update BIOS UEFI microcode accommodate for additional CPU. 1. Unlikely. 2. it were possible 'd be left an unstable laptop. P-Series is designed for stability from factory this would undo all of that. microcode that would be in your BIOS wouldn't be intended for hardware have leading BSODs and other issues. 3. a 8750H in your P50 wouldn't it be better fabricate a bracket for a P52 Mobo and use that? That's a lot less failure points and simpler too. I would say it's a better idea fab a mount for a new motherboard and find some smashed P52 or 53 a thrashed exterior. Or just buy a P52.,0.089,0.855,0.055,-0.8457,-1

gkarmx,thinkpad,Really excited buy this once price comes down a bit. Have been trying convert a older gen version of this wireless usb without much success. I've got a few questions 1. How is trackpoint on this? older gen had low profile trackpoint deep buttons but this looks super low flat clicky buttons? Does it have good driver support on your mac or linux use that . 2. How is build quality? older gen worked well but didn't feel great button texture was rough plastic and lettering seemed pasted on body wasn't very rigid . Does this one have a more rubber-like texture on keys similar X1 series? 3. How is key travel on this? older gen had pretty good key travel. I type more comfortably on that compared my P1G2 wondering this one borrowed more than flat trackpoint buttons from X1 carbon/yoga last year I believe those had shallowest key travel on thinkpads yet .,0.06,0.756,0.184,0.9743,1

gklvpg,thinkpad,In my opinion don't bash it around and don't spill anything on keyboard after many years find battery won't hold much of a charge anymore. But that applies all laptops. As extreme examples I have a 365XD that I bought in 2000 and won't power on any more. I have a 760EL that I bought in 2002 and works fine except battery. I also have an X61s about 10 years old T420 about 7 years old that work and currently have a 25th anniversary about 2 years old and these all work fine.,0.0,0.957,0.043,0.3818,1
gklvpg,thinkpad,For reliability laptops are pretty reliable and usually last 8 years take care of them For replacement it entirely depends on what 're using laptop for. also depends on how fast future processors be. 're using it for office word processing then could be looking at a very long time. For example X230 and T430 were released in 2012 and still be used for basic office work and web browsing. Assuming have upgraded ram and moved a SSD drive T440P was released in late 2013 and probably still be effective for another 3-4 years at least. T540P was released at same time and probably be effective for 1-2 years longer than T440P. However from 2012-2017 Intel was focused making CPU's more energy efficient vs increasing speed. wasn't until T480 was released that CPU's had a big jump in processing power over previous year's laptops. Now AMD has come out faster CPU's and this encourage Intel come out faster CPU's. So in next few years competition may drive CPU's become noticeably faster than today's current CPU's. So replacability is not easily predictable because it really depends on whether / a faster CPU. Another example in 2008 Lenovo released X61. By 2016 X61 was dated and was not good enough play some Youtube videos and some 2K or 4K content. In contrast in 2012 X230 was released and it still play YouTube 2K and 4K content.,0.034,0.867,0.099,0.9519,1

gklvpg,thinkpad,take care of it like anything else it last. Don’t drop or spill things on it and probably get 8-10 years out of it stretching it? ’s totally worth it get an upgradeable model.

gklvpg,thinkpad,I use an 8 X230 Tablet and 9 X220 year old Thinkpad on a regular basis. So long as a motherboard component doesn't fail I'll probably get a few more years out of both of them now that they both have SSDs and enough RAM run most things I throw at them NOTE I have a desktop for things like gaming/video editing/heavy graphic design...other office tasks run fine . There's some things that have changed Thinkpads that might hit somebody that owns a new Thinkpad less than me and my older beaters Batteries- No longer easy peasy replace have open case so I guess perhaps just easy ...ish...depending on one's savvy computers . RAM- not all modern ThinkPads offer user replaceable SODIMMS anymore - RAM be soldered board Lenovo does it transparent which models have soldered RAM or not. HDs- similar issue as RAM but tends only hit lower end models and not X or T. And there are just some machines Lenovo occasionally drops ball on looking at my X1 Tablet which sometimes takes months become apparent but is super annoying see a bunch of users report failure issues/are sending their machines depot be fixed.

gjv2o1,AcerOfficial,USB-C power banks are for computers that be powered from a USB-C or Thunderbolt port. You have do your research before purchasing your computer. Acer A515-51G series requires a 45w-65w power supply. You always extend your battery power by changing your power settings Balanced or Battery Saver. For normal workloads expect about 5 hours of power while in Balance power mode. Any sort of gaming or processor intensive applications reduce that time significantly. Consider weight size of power bank. I look for something under 3 pounds that fit in laptop bag. Don't expect a power bank provide a laptop a full day of power. is useful for squeezing out an hour or two when really get work done. For traveling other devices it is a fair reserve power source. You have shop carefully because not all models have a 100w port. These links are not recommendations. They are intended give an idea of what is available and what features consider. You have look carefully at specs for portable power banks because they are mostly underpowered designed for smaller devices like phones tablets. P.S. Forget anything that has a solar panel or claims it power your devices from a solar panel. Most portable solar panels only have an output of 10w in EXTREME DIRECT SUNLIGHT. You then lose some of power in conversion which be a 40% loss in most cheaply made devices. Those devices won't charge an attached power bank in less than 40 hours of direct sunlight.,0.028,0.912,0.06,0.7184,1

fqxan0,AcerOfficial,Why would anyone swap SSD for HDD? only good thing I've done that improved overall speed is getting an SSD. You don't any sense. more storage then just install an additional SATA 2.5 Drive. Why do think Nitro and newer laptop have SATA drive and m.2 slots both? I don't understand .,0.0,0.883,0.117,0.7476,1
fqxan0,AcerOfficial,I understand your thought process its definitely merits where are coming from. We've all been there using computers for long enough. Its doable really but.. A common 2.5hdd in a laptop taking bumps and other things actually be just as prone failing been seeing it from a guy working data recovery. A fucked up hdd is just as hit-or-miss recover from. SSDs without encryption like a phone or using bitlocker or similar a pro would know whats up in event should it crap out on important files on it We're not migrating hdds around as much as we used . I still own harddrives from 2005 that runs this day but modern hardware is in a much more expendable state and laptop probably wont last long enough for ssd hit writing-wall and 're not gonna be able migrate hdd swap it out anyway since uefi guid partitions from windows 10 and so forth without extensive adminstrative IT experience. Installing hdd as a second drive and saving everything deem needs be recoverable is a better solution objectively speaking. modify your thought process just a smidgen have your peace of mind and sanity saved much easier than what gain from hassle of cloning drive,0.039,0.827,0.135,0.97,1
fqxan0,AcerOfficial,They are setup as RAID0. So get a windows install usb ready. Go in bios and change drive interface and shutdown. Pull ssd. Boot usb and install windows. bios doesn't automatically pick up hdd as a boot drive 'll have change that in bios too. And no don't always know that a hdd is going out. they have electronics on them too and sometimes they just die without any warning. You are living in an old age. But have fun. And don't do this yourself...there are specialty places such as exotic pc that your mods system before get it. Or find someone that changes for for payment of your ssd.,0.053,0.88,0.068,0.1867,1
fqxan0,AcerOfficial,That is an awful idea and slow down your computer. All would have do is clone drive. Since don't know that would clone drive should just forget all about migrating from SSD HDD because it is a really bad idea. Your preference is due lack of knowledge. I'm guessing read something about this idea or some idiot friend of yours convinced do it.

As for performance no idea what do. Having do Optimus render on NV direct Intel does have a performance hit but I wouldn't expect it be that bad.

However this time around avoid interrupting process or overriding automated settings. You'll select delete everything option get original partitions recreated. This wipe entire drive and delete all partitions. Then recovery tools recreate proper partitions and restore original Windows 7 and Acer software. After mfg restore is finished I'd a disk image of entire drive for safekeeping. Then I'd run free Windows 10 upgrade update all Windows patches and then another disk image so won't have spend hours doing this all over again swap hard drives or have a serious software problem in future.

fjrudy,AcerOfficial,I have i5 1050 Ti version of Nitro 5. I upgraded RAM 16 GB and added a 1TB SSD. it runs GTA 5 and SimCity 4 just fine. play current AAA games like GTA 5 I would avoid RX560. isn't a very fast graphics card.

fjrudy,AcerOfficial,I have that one too so in my opinion it is good for some e-sports games such as dota 2 league of legends pubg fortnite etc. However it is not so good for AAA titles meaning latest games. Also many people have been complaining myself included about keyboard buttons not working properly and only solution for that is replace keyboard laptop is still under a warranty. I bought an external keyboard since I use my laptop for work too and I 't wait for shop do process of sending it receiving it etc. that take a month or more. Overall it is an ok laptop for gaming plan play e-sports games but I would rather buy something else now and some other brand too knowing what I know.

I've got a very similar laptop same specs except came 256 hard drive and I did some upgrades on it . Also just putting this out there but it games completely fine when not plugged in then maybe problem is software related rather than hardware? I'd definitely try a factory reset before thermal paste back games from steam up onto an external drive don't have redownload . And just one more thing How long ago did she get laptop? it is within a month of purchase she still get a warranty put on it and I think there is by default a manufacturers warranty of 1 year for 2019 and up predators 2 years before that . However from what I've read doing a repaste yourself voids that warranty although do other modifications without voiding warranty so long as don't damage anything while doing them and remove them before shipping your system in . Also just putting this out there but probably about 4 months after I got my predator I had some weird issue where my laptop was staying too warm for like a week instead of idling between 35-47 Celsius like normal it was idling in high 60's high 70's and when gaming it would be maxed out on like bioshock 1 during just moving around . I was just about break down and reopen it up but problem pretty much resolved on its own so I'm not sure it was a software thing that got worked out or maybe there was a slight fan obstruction that cleared itself. has pretty much been completely fine for last several months.,0.038,0.839,0.123,0.9808,1
fd3vki,AcerOfficial,Don't think about trying repaste your computer when lack expertise do it properly a high-quality thermal paste or carbon pad. risk is too high for potentially causing more damage during disassembly of computer. most common heat problem is from tinkering settings in an attempt overclock system without enough knowledge about computers in general. anyone has been adjusting performance settings reset everything defaults. second most common tends be related tinkering video card settings force NVIDIA card always act as primary. This has high-end GPU working harder all time instead of moments when it is really needed. Let Intel onboard GPU handle mundane tasks and keep power draw heat a minimum. third most common issue is CPU voltage running as computer is needed for high-end tasks.

eyalqg,AcerOfficial,Hey gotta chill yourself first. Everyone stumbles on obstacles and giving up is not answer. 1 Firstly most important of all and I cannot stress this enough did verify ISO according its checksum? Its GPG key? You search articles on how do this. 2 Have first updated BIOS latest version? Note when updating BIOS update it incrementally. Starting from version number directly after version in your BIOS then repeat until reach latest version. 3 Have tried other linux distros? Ubuntu Linux Mint Manjaro Solus are great distros for newcomers. Note your CPU and GPU is relatively new try distos that offer newer Linux kernels those that offer 5.x series kernels. You look at distro's changelog for more info. 4 Maybe flash drive or USB writing tool is problem. Note Grab another spare flash drive preferably 4GB or more and flash ISO using Rufus or Etcher. I like flash using Etcher as it validates files in flash drive after flashing. OR Try original drive in another computer this tell what problem is either computer or flash drive. 5 all else fails file a bug report distro dev tracker. They most likely help . Or post your problem in linux and elementary os subreddit or similar subreddits.,0.062,0.827,0.112,0.8386,1
exp0ms,AcerOfficial,First that Sandisk is kinda junky for a supposed data center grade SSD. For those of us who manage data centers seeing that tag on a drive tells us it won't be great for performance but it'll probably be last drive in rack that might fail. I wouldn't expect much performance from a 6th gen i3 dual-core processor. Since didn't specify which model have in that series. might be lucky and have an M.2 NVMe port that significantly improve performance over any SATA SSD. A few models in that series also take a max of 32GB RAM so have an upgrade path that might be wasted on an i3 processor. I'm not advocating straining your budget I'm just making sure are aware of advantages and limits of that computer. You didn't mention cloned original drive or ran a clean install of Windows on that SSD. ran a clean install have some cleanup do. You'll disable some of Win10 resource chokes in background. i.e. Privacy settings Microsoft account sync settings Cortana settings Game Bar Game DVR settings etc. Keep in mind that your total RAM run at speed of slowest RAM have installed. While different sized RAM work in those slots may end up unexpected performance loss. DDR works best when it is balanced. same number of chips same speed and latency. This is real reason for recommendation of matched sets of RAM. You did something we are all guilty of occasionally doing had a spare stick of RAM stuck it in empty slot. performance dropped because RAM controller is working harder balance different amount of RAM in each slot in addition constantly adjusting for differences in speed and latency.,0.093,0.809,0.098,0.3722,1

Many of drivers in Acer computers are synced Windows updates simplify update process. exceptions are usually Intel Nvidia and AMD drivers/software utilities. are having a specific problem should also check Acer support page for a BIOS update. One easy method see a newer driver exists is open Windows device manager expand each of device sections and then right-click on each device select Update Driver then Search Automatically for updated driver software .

This is official product page not a retail sales page Acer lists monitor as being VESA 100 x 100mm compatible .

As of now i ordered some liquid metal see it does any good for thermals that's my only hope left however my GPU is very cool at 65c max .Now i am just waiting for it arrive and apply it see it does any good. sorry for my Bad English ,0.092,0.727,0.181,0.9494,1

U.S. datasheets are not always accurate for models released in other regions. While I strongly recommend a 1TB M.2 SSD as your boot drive have decide based on your budget. 1TB SSD always have better performance than smaller drives. are going a 512GB SSD it be a good economical and mid-range performance choice. Many times there are problems when trying clone from a larger HDD a smaller SSD. Especially when target is a M.2 SSD. You might be better off creating Acer recovery media so install a clean version of Windows M.2 SSD. By using Acer media 'll have all drivers and Acer pre-installed software.

Simply opening laptop or any electronic including game consoles and breaking any void broken stickers or other indicators 't void warranty regardless of what manufacturer says. With that out of way though all Acer laptops I've had so far have a small doosection on bottom that allows add/replace HDDs easily without having open entire laptop. I don't imagine there's too many things that could go wrong putting HDD into laptop. You definitely find many videos of other people doing this other laptops for a general idea on process. For someone new this I imagine it would take about 5-15 minutes being careful. Anyone experienced could likely do it in less than 5 minutes. Typically a standard 2.5 HDD or SSD it involves 1. Removing a screw 2. Lifting panel off laptop 3. Removing HDD caddy it's in laptop still typically involves removing 4 screws 4. Put HDD into caddy typically via 4 separate screws 5. Carefully connect HDD while in caddy SATA/connection cable hardest part but easy 're careful and take your time 6. Reverse steps 1-3 put back 4 caddy screws put panel back put screw back 7. Power on laptop and do whatever HDD As why they didn't include HDD in laptop begin no idea.

Its like having 3 different traffic cops speaking different languages but trying respond hand signals they all know while also attempting direct traffic. Some folks circumvented entire cluster and added a special adapter or cable a active chipset monitoring not real term but I simplified it . Here are some old example links from Reddit subs mfg should have updated versions of products by now.

dgn1by,AcerOfficial,I own a 2016 Acer predator so i 't answer 1st question but since 2 and 3 are general i help avoid some of mistakes I made. 2. Check and monitor your temps. After about a year of usage suddenly my FPS for gaming tanked. I used Speccy and realised motherboard was overheating. I opened up laptop chassis and found that one of fan connectors for mobo was loose. Then same thing happened but for CPU and GPU. I changed horrible gunk Acer calls thermal paste and voila-temperatures in high 60's low 70's a gaming load. My only regret is I over-tightened screws and stripped some of them. Also clean exhaust fans from time time avoid build up of dust which increase your temperatures. Get a good waterproof backpack carry it extra padding. use it for work and home gaming invest in an extra power adapter don't it be original one . That way all have do is plug it in and won't risk damaging power adapter like I did. Plus its a real hassle cable manage and carry extra brick and cord. 3.I do recommend getting a good laptop cooler. I ordered this one but it hasn't been delivered yet. Again a mistake not use one from start as it actually boost performance since CPU and GPU boost frequencies be maintained thermal throttling doesn't occur. Let me know have any other doubts and congrats on your new laptop.,0.133,0.705,0.162,0.8788,1
dgn1by,AcerOfficial,Yes upgrade version of Windows. license keys aren't as accessible as they used be. This is Microsoft's way fight back against software piracy. also solves problem of losing license keys original media after having computer for a few years. Make sure get a minimum 16GB USB Flash drive create your recovery media. Any significant changes are recorded in your Microsoft account so don't have keep track of so much information. Once login computer your Microsoft account hardware profile and license keys are saved. nice part is that ever have wipe reinstall on that computer simply login your Microsoft account when are done and activation be automatic. Fortunately cleaning computer software and physical dust is a lot easier. You'll notice temperature changes as put it use over time dust builds up inside 'll notice constant higher temperatures. Don't be too alarmed about idea of dust buildup. it happens anything that has force air flow in an enclosure. simply took a long time for general public be aware of dust in their computers. Don't adjustments how your computer operates until items like heat performance affect your use.

d5uls4,AcerOfficial,Welcome REDDIT! Many of answers and additional information always be obtained from support page for your computer. You would have been redirected that page when registered your computer for warranty. You probably already found general data sheet Always look up part number of RAM currently installed in your computer open case look at it sure get correct specs. Your E5 laptop use 16GB max of DDR3 PC3-12800 -BUT- specifically needs low voltage so-dimms labeled DDR3L-1600. Many people ignore that L which indicates low voltage and they find out hard way that higher voltage RAM not work at all in their computer. You definitely splurge add more RAM. Another 4GB stick of RAM help day--day regular work. are debating 16GB upgrade it really depends on how use your computer most people are surprised that they don't strain their budget and max out on RAM because they don't really stress their computer enough use of it. Yeah I'll admit I maxxed mine 32GB just because I could and not because 20% of my work actually needs it. your budget stretch a bit consider getting an SSD drive for your primary boot drive and then move your current drive CD-Rom caddy. You easily clone current drive new SSD free version of Macrium. That one change give a definite performance boost for that particular laptop and add a couple more years of life it. ADATA Su800 is a fast economical 1TB SSD. performs very close Samsung Intel and Crucial at half cost. is frequently on sale at Amazon for under 100. Remember that all SSDs larger capacity better performance 'll get. Those CD-Rom replacement HDD caddies are pretty darn cool. I've used them on a couple ASUS laptops and they worked great. Adding more storage is a much better use of that CD-Rom bay. You do update BIOS for any problem corrections for your system and resolve SSD related issues. Most driver updates should be delivered by Windows Updates but it never hurts check them too. Before start all this sure get at least a 16GB usb drive create system recovery media.

d49s10,AcerOfficial,depends on your budget. I've researched tested SSD for my ACERs and was surprised at how flexible manufacturers are when posting specs. spend money higher-end Samsung and Intel lines are peak performers at a premium price. within 95% of same performance for a drastically lower price sometimes 50% lower ADATA product line is really impressive. I personally went ADATA SX8200 Pro M.2 1TB 150US at Amazon and ADATA SU800 2.5 2TB SSD. There are a lot of complaints but none of them are about 1TB or 2TB SSD products which are faster than lower capacity products. I wanted extra space speeds close Samsung 970 EVO Plus and a decent price. I move manipulate a lot of data so I needed a faster data drive. Without overspending now I'll be more willing upgrade a 4TB SSD when they have more reasonable prices. In my case I simply used free version of Macrium clone boot drive new M.2 SSD swapped them and booted up without any problems. I saved an image of my original boot drive for safekeeping. Normally I save original drive but in this case I bought a little external case for it so I could use it for cloning then backups. are just looking for a second drive for storage in 2.5 bay don't focus as much on write speeds as would were shopping for a boot drive.,0.047,0.837,0.117,0.9463,1

d1b516,AcerOfficial,That isn't an actual product page. is what is considered part of line card . lists base model and options that are controlled by regional distributor. You'll search for Aspire 5 A515-54G which should produce a few more retail distributors. Once find regional distributor i.e. Amazon.com Walmart.com NewEgg.com etc 'll see what options they have choose from. Some specific units also have export or distribution limitations so might have get creative when ordering from Ottawa. ACER ASUS and MSI are very popular because of flexibility for user installable upgrades. Most purchasers some tech experience buy a moderately priced base unit best CPU they afford and then upgrade RAM and hard drive for larger capacity or better quality components. ACER Aspire 5 line ships a rather low-end M.2 SATA B M key SSD installed. M.2 port is a 2280 PCIe NVMe port which is easily compatible nearly any M.2 2280 NVMe M key SSD Samsung ADATA Intel etc .

Make sure check Device Manager for any red or yellow flags indicating a problem a component. Sometimes manually starting a Windows Update scan catch any missing drivers. With Acer computers I always work my way down list in Device Manage checking for updates automatically search . Sometimes a component update when Acer Windows Update doesn't show a new driver is available. I've forgotten that 1050Ti model has MaxxAudio utility.

cus95j,AcerOfficial,1. 20GBGB combined intel optane . has only one slot of memory but cannot be upgraded cause it's soldered. 2. When i google it it use a m.2 but also is soldered. 3. To buy it check amazon or newegg. I would advice buy another model of laptop since main components are not upgradeable for one HDD and Ram and in most cases maxing these out as in max ram and hdd/ ssd space would cost allot. Meanwhile purchasing a laptop that does part is upgradeable change them gradually or right away in ky opinion. Hope this info would help .,0.0,0.907,0.093,0.8573,1

cty74v,AcerOfficial,Ringgit U.S. dollar conversion puts your budget around 1200 U.S. for a video editing rig. I think might be limited specific models permitted be distributed in Malaysia. With video editing 'll definitely select a model that has a dedicated video card. Nitro or Helios series are pushed toward gamers but they have high performance GPU video that fit your needs. You should spend time reading Reddit subs discussing Nitro 5 and Helios 300 With quad core processing PCIe SSD and an upgrade 32GB RAM 'll enjoy ease of editing and response of occasional game. were only occasionally editing video I'd look at mid-range laptops for about half price. They won't have discrete video or higher resolution screens but rest of components be nearly same. I have most experience Aspire 3 5 models. I personally prefer Aspire 5 A515-52-526C. has a max of 32GB RAM PCIe and SATA SSD ports 15.6 screen 1080P resolution and a quad-core i5-8265U Another lower budget option is Acer Aspire 5 A515-51-523X 15.6 Full HD 1920 x 1080 Intel i5-8250U 8GB DDR4 256GB SSD Windows 10 Home Aspire 5 has a decent resolution screen already boots from a M.2 SSD. M.2 most likely be a SATA SSD in PCIe slot. Every one I have opened has been a SATA SSD. Its an easy clone replace PCIe SSD boost speed. comes 4GB Ram soldered and 4GB in slot. runs surprisingly well on 8GB but I'd recommend replacing 4GB stick 8GB or 16GB depending on your budget and whatever is on sale. is a bit of a hassle get SATA cable so install a 2.5 SATA HDD or SSD for additional storage. You may not it right away but it is nice know upgrade is available. For price hardware upgrade options Aspire 5 would be a great purchase. Someone might point Swift series as a more viable option.

cqbki8,AcerOfficial,You might have same series but depending on country of origin date of manufacturing and actual model number I doubt 'll ever find a YouTube video for exact same laptop. 2.5 drive IS second drive.

My view is that Optane boost while great improve platter drive performance is a waste of a PCIe port unless don't have budget upgrade. rant Why use a small Optane SSD cache a copy of Windows when run your entire installation from m.2 SSD and get better performance? /rant At least ended up good Optane SSD. performance of that 32GB is far superior 16GB so don't trash it. I have an ACER Aspire 5 A515-52-526C i5-8265U quad core . had a 256GB SATA m.2 in PCIe port. I replaced it a 1TB PCIe upgraded 8GB 32GB RAM added a 1TB SATA SSD and am extremely happy results.

Start simple stuff router might have a bug in firmware specific your environment check see there is an update available. Install an app on your phone scan for local WiFi access points.

You might have change channel are using least used channel being broadcast around . your WiFi access point or all-in-one router has multi-frequency options try switching from G N.

cg4kca,AcerOfficial,RTX performs better based on userbenchmark.com but I believe 2060 select there for comparison is probably desktop card which probably runs faster than laptop 2060 as they are usually a bit slower due various constrictions in power and dimension etc... However I think 1660 ti somewhat slower would probably be more useful for most laptop users since afaik its also more power efficient than 2060 which is a big plus for gaming on train or unplugged in general. I havent actually seen what 2060 laptop gpu powerdraw is but I think 1660s big thing for laptops was power efficiency since it wasn't really a big revolution in terms of speed increment over previous laptop gpus.,0.0,0.884,0.116,0.9275,1

There might also be another explanation - in lot of laptop they use same type of SSDs but from different manufacturers and a slightly different specifications. Perhaps originally there was faster SSD in your laptop but service had only same type but slower ones on stock so they used them. Then it might be ok. There is also a third possibility there is problem this new SSD. But only service get an answer and eventually a solution.
