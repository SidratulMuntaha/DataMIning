1,gqu0nl,SuggestALaptop,0,2020/05/27 01:45:48,Night,PC/Mac quality control Hi After having used MacBooks for ages I got a deal on a Lenovo X1 Carbon Yoga tried it. After 3 months the finger print scanner malfunctioned. Then there was an issue the Wifi card. Then the motherboard. Three tech guys tried fix it but failed. After some tough arguments Lenovo's terrible support I got my money back. Now I'm back at my old MacBook but will soon need a new machine. What struck me was that two of the tech guys who fix Lenovo PCs Macs here in Austria said that there is a huge difference in quality management. Lenovo has a rather good reputation but it's nothing compared Macs which for instance according them have serial numbers on most major parts. Lenovo doesn't. I'm generally against buying a notebook that I can't upgrade soldered RAM - wtf? but of course I'd rather have that than a machine that doesn't work at all. Do know anything about the qc of the main notebook producers? Thanks so much!

Leave any finishing thoughts here that may feel are necessary beneficial the discussion. Looking for reliability peace of mind focus on a good display for content consumption not creation so color accuracy doesn't matter but vivid saturated colors are nice. Considering Surface Book 3 for which I would not buy the iPad but the lack of a significant design change since 2015 is sad lackluster. I'm a big fan of the iPad as a tablet so the SB3's tablet mode would only be useful for note taking is trash otherwise. Macbook Pro 16 looks good in my mind seems be very reliable. MacOS seems more reliable than windows which I've always used but stresses me out the laggy updating blue screens. Best build quality speakers quality control best macbook pro since forever correct me I'm wrong. Anyway it's way too expensive even though many issues are fixed so I'm wondering it's worth the price. Currently using XPS 15 9560 whose trackpad has popped out due swollen battery. Waiting for the new XPS 15 17's reviews see the Killer wifi thermals coil whine other little annoying things have been improved. Better speakers keyboard would be nice too. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme looks solid but I've heard bad things about the Carbon's quality control Lenovo in general. Bezels are too thick but I could probably get used this. Display appears be great for content consumption though. Love the keyboard best in class. Those are my options. If 're rooting for one of them please comment on why please recommend other devices as well. Thanks a bunch.

I am searching for a 2 in 1 laptop take notes for university but while I'm there I'll be leaving my main pc so I'd like play some games like overwatch sims or maybe a bit of GTA V. The surface book can run games better but I'm not convinced about the idea of taking the whole screen out If someone has a surface book I'd love hear about your experience On the other hand I don't think the XPS will manage such a nice gaming experience because it has integrated graphics. I'd also like something that will last at least 4-5 years. I'm searching for something that costs 1500 euros or pounds I still don't know where I'll buy it from. Any other laptop suggestions are more than welcome

She likes her old Acer laptop not sure which model it is purchased 5-8 years ago is having battery other issues . She got a chromebook but she's not a fan of it so I'm helping find something else. The budget is approx 1 000 Canadian but a bit flexible suggestions can cost a bit more or less . She'll use it for general stuff - work emails netflix browsing the internet etc. but I'd also like make sure she can use it for years come. I'm looking for something windows 10 a 15 screen would be good I think. Preferrably a decent IPS screen her my dad were watch shows on it. I'd also like make sure she doesn't run into any issues speed-wise so I'd like a decent SSD harddrive or whatever the new SSDs are called possibly a bit of extra ram maybe 8gb total would be cool decent enough processor more battery life is probably preferred over more speed though . Also she likely wouldn't need too much storage overall but the more storage space the better I'm thinking they download lots of shows movies etc. . Microphone camera needed as well. She generally uses the touchpad instead of a mouse also no touch screen needed. She doesn't seem care too much about having a super thin laptop but I don't think she would something too too bulky either. That's about all I can think of for now. I'd like give her a few options as well so any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!

2,gqgarl,SuggestALaptop,7,2020/05/26 10:26:57,Morning,Help me decide between two laptops Ryzen vs Intel  A very good friend of mine decided that she needs a new laptop. She doesn't a PC because she wants take it University. Her budget is a bit tight but after some searches we found two very good options from HP This 250 G7 rocking an Intel i5-8265U UHD 620 Graphics. And This weird model number laptop rocking a Ryzen 7 3700U Vega 10 graphics. All other specs are the same. The Ryzen one is newer has USB C. It also looks better but this is not a game changer. Honestly I told her go the Ryzen one. I've searched for some becnchmarks on the internet it seems that the intel is just slightly faster. We are comparing here a top Ryzen CPU of the latest generation an i5 Intel of two generations ago... Also comparing the graphics of the two it seems that the Ryzen one is much faster... The thing is her brother suggested her get the Intel one. Which one shoud she choose? This includes possible the question of the quality of the display the battery life. The build quality is another important factor but even don't have experience those laptops a quick answer regarding which system is better is more than welcome! Thank very very much in advance! Edit She wants use the laptop for mostly office work as she manages some Excel tables she plays some light games GTA 5 CS GO some others she does light Photoshop editing. Also have suggestions from other manufacturers please tell me. Those two laptops are at sale so this is why we chose them. Edit 2 This DELL laptop is rocking an i5 10210U a Radeon 610 graphics card this Asus has an i5 1035G1. Both are very good options. Do suggest getting one of those instead?

Probably not going be the one for me but wanted toss it up here. 2. Dell Something It seems like a powerful machine but why is is so cheap in comparison? Should I avoid Dell? Or is this not actually a nice laptop for my needs? Not sure about that graphics card especially. 3. Asus Zenbook I seem like as well but feel this graphics card is not too powerful. 4. ASUS ROG Zephyrus G also seems too cheap for its specs is there something I should be weary of? 5. ThinkPad P73 Mobile Workstation seems very good for the Memorial Day Sale price. Probably my current choice. Is that graphics card any good? 6. ASUS ProArt Studio Book Pro w700G3T is kind of out of budget but seems worth it for its cost. Does this have very good graphics?

However then I started looking at iPad pro 2020. It is more powerful than most windows laptop has great camera display battery life is good can last for long periods of time. However I have watched many reviews from people who say that the software still needs improvement but since my sister is interested in getting an iPad for a while is okay getting one I was going buy it.

I also was thinking about MacBook Air but they are too expensive I have read many articles saying that they break don't have warranty then it's expensive repair. The reason why I need your help is give me your opinion on whether is it good get her an iPad pro 2020 or just get any windows laptop form HP or Dell other brands I don't know but open suggestions or get MacBook Air.

0,gqblhn,SuggestALaptop,1,2020/05/26 06:11:19,Night,Stuck between the asus zenbook pro duo the microsoft surfacebook 3. I'm completely stuck between these two. They both have 32Gb of ram i would use them for a mixture of uni work real work gaming. I currently have the last gen zenbook pro without the second screen an i7 HQ processor 8gb of ram 1050 gpu but it has now broken. I have been pretty disapointed build quality after 2 years it is extremely tired the charging port has broken the frame has warped the thermal throttling was frustrating i always wished it had more umph in the ram gpu departments. On one hand I love the versatility of the surface book the fact it turns into a tablet would i really use it in this mode though? the fact i can touch write on the main screen the pen. It also has enough power for some gaming the 1660 ti max q gpu whilst remaining slim great aesthetics. On the other hand i also love the zenbook pro duo that second screen i would genuinely use that all the time it is also way more powerful an i9 hk cpu rtx 2060 graphics the downside is it's pretty big there are reports of poor build quality which would make sense as my current zenbook pro is pretty poorly made . It also just doesn't look as crisp clean as the surface book me the stylus seems like a bit of a gimmick as the touch screen is so small Which one should I get why? Has anyone owned either of these?

I am looking forward buy a new laptop which I can use at home for business but also take the laptop me work on my way appointments. Right now I can‘t decide between the new MacBook Air or the Acer Swift 5. I asked all my friends MacBooks also all my friends other Laptops Acer Lenovo Asus... but I always end up the same results 50/50. Now I dont know what buy I have a budget of 1‘500€. The MacBook Air I can afford this budget would have an Intel i5 10Gen Quad-Core max 3.5Ghz Turboboost 16GB RAM 512GB SSD. The Acer on the other hand would have an Intel i7 10th Gen Quad-Core max. 3.9Ghz 16GB RAM 1TB of SSD. The Acer also has Touchscreen a lot more port‘s while the Air only has 2 Thunderbolt ports i think. The Air would cost around 1500€ the Acer would cost around 1300€. The Acer weights 990g while the Macbook Air weights 1.25kg. What would recommend why? Is there some other Laptop would recommend? Thank guys!

0,gqbdfc,SuggestALaptop,3,2020/05/26 05:56:42,Night,Laptop for autoCad 3DSMax Photoshop. Would appreciate response for someone who works similar software. Hi a friend of mine asked me for advice on a new laptop since I'm the tech savvy one in the group. The problem is I'm more of a desktop gameoverclocker myself so I don't really know the software he uses stresses more the CPU or the GPU I'm generally not that familiar laptop hardware how parts performs in relationship one another. Considering what his budget allows the sadly limited availability of these peculiar times we arrived two possible candidates i7 9750H/10750H GTX 1660Ti Ryzen 7 3750H RTX 2060 The software he uses Photoshop Indesign AutoCAD Vray 3dsmax Rhino Revit Both configs have their pros cons. For example Vray benefits enormously from the RTX 2060 but I'm afraid the 3750H's lackluster single threaded performance is gonna be a bottleneck in Photoshop AutoCAD since AFAIK AMD really didn't catch up Intel's single threaded performance until Zen 2. I know his best option would be buy a series 4000 Ryzen but those aren't available yet he can't delay his purchase. Thank for your time.

2,gq2wyt,SuggestALaptop,4,2020/05/25 18:44:40,Afternoon,Gaming Laptop for Child Hello all. I'm looking for recommendations for a laptop sort of spec-wise but mostly also reliability-wise. This laptop will be for an 11-year old who currently mostly plays modded Minecraft Roblox but may get into some other games as she gets older. Most of the laptops I've been seeing are coming 8gb RAM but I feel like 16 would be my personal goto at this point however 8gb is sufficient then that would open up more possibilities. I also know that I personally prefer having just a single SSD instead of an SSD HDD combo but people would really suggest doing the combo then can do that too. Overall just looking for suggestions. Some of the particular models been considering are ASUS TUF Dell G3/5 Lenovo L340 or Y545 ASUS Rog Strix II. The sales person at Microcenter yesterday also suggested the HP omen. Currently the best deal but now sold out that I think I've found is a TUF a Ryzen 4800H 1TB SSD 16GB 3200 ram for 1200. Is that a deal we should try pursuing or something cheaper? Budget I was originally looking in was 800-1000 but can stretch it'll mean better value longevity. Let me know there's any questions I'm not answer too. Thanks!

I've been looking into purchasing a new laptop for a while now the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 sounds perfect. I make sure I know everything I need though before buying it. I watched a reddit review by CrystalRam on the laptop everything he said about it is what i'm looking for. Affordable good performance solid battery life. Are there any downfalls the laptop I should be aware about? Or any competitors at the same price rage that offer a better deal? The standard Lenovo IdeaPad comes 256gb SSD. I'm currently on Mac have replaced its hard drive a 500gb Samsung SSD which has been in use for approximately 2 years now. Would this SSD still be in somewhat prime condition I wanted replace the 256gb SSD since I'm unaware of how long these normally take ware down in performance they do at all. Another thing is it safe reliable order a laptop online? I don't know anyones had experiences careless delivering or anything like that or I can feel safe knowing that ordering it online it will arrive in perfect condition. I'm in Australia so would be purchasing off the Lenovo website not Amazon. I am open ideas have any other laptop suggestions that are equal or better at the same price range cheers

This weekend seems be a good time look some memorial day deals floating around an a good idea of what the 2020 offerings look like. My budget is 1500 maximum would ideally like keep things closer 1 000. What I'm Doing With This Thing Complex excel spreadsheets run at the same time multiple browser tabs. Adobe illustrator or equivalent programs Adobe photoshop or equivalent programs. Some photo storage happy use external drive for this . Light gaming possible - not critical would like run League of Legends Starcraft maybe remastered Halo/Halo 2 . Assuming frequent video calls now that a lot of things are remote/mixed remote. Planning keep for 2-4 years so bumping specs would be nice for longevity. Screen Size Preference 15 would be ideal nothing larger. Smaller would be fine as I have a good monitor from my desktop build that I'll continue use. Ports Full size SD slot is important for importing photos HDMI port for additional displays. Keyboard / Trackpad Fairly important as I'll be doing a lot of work on the go. Will likely pick up a separate more comfortable keyboard/mouse for design work heavy writing. Screen Color accuracy is important for illustrative work bright high-quality screen is a priority. Hardware ideally 256gb-512gb SSD 16gb RAM. Not sure new gen i5 is fine or i'll spec up a bit for creative work. Also not sure how important dedicated vs. integrated graphics cards will be for creative work. What I'm considering New XPS 15 or 13 w/ i5 RAM bumped 16gb seems expensive for what get no HDMI Acer predator 500 or conceptd 5 no SD card slot battery life / heat issues Asus zephyrus g14 no webcam no SD heat some lower end Acer books seem sacrifice build quality/horsepoweboth . EDIT Macs are going be off the table even though they are ideal for creative work - some excel addons have issues running parallel / virtual windows I'd rather avoid opening that can of worms. x200B Any insights are appreciated.

After spending a few hours here looking at suggestions how I found the laptop in the first place or watching reviews on YouTube this laptop seemed be the one. But after doing a little more research I started seeing a lot of posts about issues the fan backlighting strange sounds not getting maximum battery life etc. In my eyes I don't buy something that I feel like will give me issues or isn't as advertised this is kinda a big purchase for me. So I am just wondering anyone has any suggestions for a laptop within the same realm Specs Price Form Factor. That I could consider or am I over thinking this should I just pull the trigger. Will purchase something today. Thank all for your help. I have learned a lot here. TL DR G14 seemed perfect looks like it has a lot of issues. Is there anything other laptops in the same ball park Form Factor Specs Price.

3,gpr8hz,SuggestALaptop,15,2020/05/25 07:10:13,Morning,Best 2in1 replace iPad Pro MBA for research university writing  I am thinking about replacing my beloved MacBook Air an iPad Pro 12.9” a good 2in1 laptop/tablet. For years now I was happily using MBA had no issues it I am really happy the flawless performance no lags no nothing plus safety portability. Recently I bought an iPad Pro 12.9” because I need a “pen on paper” performance that is I am using it mainly for reading writing on PDFs annotating browsing many pages at once on Chrome etc. Since buying an iPad I use the MBA very rarely. However though I can do most of my tasks on the iPad using Office apps writing reading annotating PDFs on great apps browsing a lot using email most importantly taking an advantage of split screen there still are some limitations. Recently I was thinking about replacing my MBA iPad one 2in1 device. It would be more comfortable have all my files in one place I am not really using iCloud the cloud service I am using is not available on the iPad still being able write on the screen. Also I think it would be cheaper because it is a bit devastating invest not only in Apple devices but also in their accessories I cannot find a decent screen protector for the Pad even after spending much money on these . As already mentioned I am mainly using my devices for MS Office activities especially Word Excel PDFs browsing other postgrad school-university-writing etc. activities sometimes light photo editing no Photoshop needed . I would not give up the split screen or touch screen function but I might be able live without such great iPad OS apps like LiquidText. The most attractive option for the 2in1 so far seems be Microsoft Surface Pro 7 or maybe even Surface Pro X. I read the negative reviews of the latter but I also saw some arguments that it is perfect for my type of tasks. Oh portability! But I guess it cannot even load a full version of Office on its ARM. This means that SP7 would probably be a safer choice even for such simple activities I do not do any gaming video editing etc. . What would be your advice?

2,gpkwvu,SuggestALaptop,7,2020/05/24 22:33:30,Evening,Don't understand difference in laptop specs I have virtually no knowledge about different pc laptop parts so I'm having a hard time deciding between the 13-inch macbook pro the 13 inch macbook air. I know there are laptops that are as good for a cheaper price but unfortunately apple has made me unable use any other laptop efficiently. I mostly use my laptop just for work but I usually have about 30 tabs four applications open so my 8gb ram macbook pro gets quite warm slow mostly because chrome eats up ram . I still don't think I need 16gb ram but i do maximise my efficiency speed for the price. So my dilemma is between the 13 inch 2020 Macbook Pro 1.4GHz quad‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up 3.9GHz the 13 inch 2020 Macbook Air 1.2GHz quad-core 10th-generation Intel Core i7 processor Turbo Boost up 3.8GHz . The Air is 50 cheaper but I really don't understand the difference advantages of having one of the processors over the other. Both devices have an 8 GB ram but the pro has 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory the air has 3733MHz LPDDR4X memory . Once again I have no idea what this means I'm guessing the difference is probably marginal but I'd love know just for my own sake as well.

I have a few questions regarding this configuration this is my first laptop purchase ever intended for starting college in the fall. Is the mx330 the 10 W or 25 W variant? Is the 512 Optane drive faster or better than the NVMe option? I also saw that Netflix won’t display 4K HDR on a device that has less than 3 GB of VRAM does this include all 4K content or just HDR? Also I am hoping that whatever laptop I buy will last at least 5 years I take really god care of electronics . With this said will this quad core hold up or should I try get a laptop 6 cores in hopes that it will last longer? Since the hp Spectre model is currently 250 off there being other Memorial Day sales I think now it is a good time purchase a laptop but I was also wondering how it stacked up a Dell Inspiron I was considering. This Inspiron is 40 less has all the same specs even the 25 W MX250 but there are hardly any reviews on this laptop. Here’s the link for the Dell I am considering Dell Inspiron Here is the hp Spectre link hp Spectre 2 in 1 Please go easy on me this is my first reddit post ever I am just looking for advice on these laptops. I found this super helpful site thought that it was perfect get my questions answered since both are relatively new models hardly any reviews online that I could find.

Leave any finishing thoughts here that may feel are necessary beneficial the discussion. Currently on a Dell XPS 15 9530 an i7-4712HQ 750M GPU. Feel that the performance is only just starting fall off from what I need at all. Main reason for replacing it is that a fan stopped working was going try replacing it now the speakers possibly sound system is borked. Getting weird noises in Bluetooth Headphones. Not yet committed replacing but see what's out there. Again I feel that current performance is mostly acceptable so I'm hoping spend much less on my next laptop then my parents spent on this one going--university present

2,gp6ilq,SuggestALaptop,3,2020/05/24 07:10:31,Morning,Laptop for Incoming Electrical Engineering Student Narrowed Down 3!  Hello again everyone! Thank for your responses from my previous post on this subreddit! After listening your responses doing my own research I have narrowed down my choices these three laptops but I don't know which choose. Please wonderful members of this subreddit I ask for your help again! Below are my choices Gigabyte Aero 15 - I like the value for the price 9th Generation Intel Core i7-9750H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD NVIDIA GTX GeForce 1660Ti especially for the discount on Amazon right now. The main selling point for me though is the screen. The color-accurate AMOLED screen just seems amazing the battery life is pretty good given that it's a 4K display too. The performance is good on benchmarks it just seems like a really good option all-around. Dell XPS 15 will pay 50 extra for the touch display - What I like about this one is also the amazing display but also the incredible performance. This machine crushes so many other laptops in benchmark tests. The only downside is that compared the other two laptops I get a weaker GPU NVIDIA GTX 1650 but I feel like the performance can make up for it. I've had my Dell XPS 13 for a while I can deal the subpar thermal performance coil whine. Eluktronics MAG-15 - The specs for the price on this laptop are absolutely amazing. They're double the RAM SSD of the other two options for a lower price than both an NVIDIA GTX 1660Ti graphics card. However I heard that the power isn't on the same level as the others the display isn't as bright not as color-accurate is a FHD display as opposed the 4K displays of the other options. However as far as bang-for-buck goes this is the way go. Anyway those were my thoughts on the laptops so please help me in my decision see which is the best one for my purposes budget. Thank so much in advance!

After 3 weeks of level 1 tech support by Alienware they finally admitted that the power supply wasn’t properly grounded for audio make matters worse the HDD was mounted directly above the power supply so every time the platter spun often it would make the distortion even louder. I’ve never had issues the 2 x MacBook Pros or the iMacs I’ve used the stability has been more than rock solid but I can no longer afford an Apple laptop the specs I’m after am not a fan of the lack of ability upgrade the RAM SSDs.

I'll also be packing it around so something that's not going break is ideal. From what I read the X1 has a brighter display better keyboard both of which are pluses. I've read a few things about problems the touch screen on the X1 getting wonky though. The X1 does come a 3 year depot warranty though. The C930 has a 8th Gen Intel Core™ i7-8550U 1.80GHz the X1 8th Generation Intel Core™ i5-8350U Processor vPro™ 1.70 GHz. Otherwise the specs seem pretty comparable.

I am looking for having a separate Laptop a separate Tablet combination instead of a 2 in 1. I would be using the Laptop primarily for CAD related stuff the Tablet for digital note taking productivity media consumption. I am interested in the mobile Workstations not the high end models though . Minimum specs that I am thinking of are 15 Intel core i7 16GB RAM 512 GB SSD a dGPU. As I won't be carrying it so often weight isn't a problem for me. I found some pretty good deals specially for Lenovo HP mobile Workstations from a local dealer here in Germany that are somewhere around 1200€- 1600€... I personally was attracted Lenovo Thinkpad p53 HP Zbook 15u G6 models of the Workstations.. Would these be wise options for a student looking for keeping the workstation for around 4-5 years without much problems? Are there any even better options other than above mentioned manufacturers? Should I wait for more promising prospects for new upgraded versions of the Workstations or for price decrease a bit since I won't be requiring one till my 3rd Semester of the university begins..? As far as the tablet is concerned Surface go 2 has caught my eye is looking promising for the tasks that I intend do on it. I was looking for 8gb/128 GB SSD model equipped Intel Pentium 4425Y-Wlan. Would it be wise get this model or pay around 80-85€ more for the Intel core m3? Also are there any other such promising tablets no iPads.. which are sturdy enough be carried around the entire time has super pen functionality for easy note taking? Thanks in advance for possible help.

I was looking at the macbook air but I need a windows based machine do a small part of my job. It can work on a Mac after bypassing some channels but they reccomend a windows based system. I primarily use my laptop do work excel/word google sheets/docs/drive then just other basic web browsing for personal things nothing too intensive. I would like keep it under 1000 possible but willing pay more for the right investment. Prioritizing longevity of the device sufficient speeds so probably i5 processor. Edit Can't copy paste the form on mobile but some additional notes - Located in US budget is 1000 - Open refurbished options - I will not be gaming/video editing - indifferent size/weight screen quality

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US Under €1300 Italy. Are open refurbs/used? Not really How would prioritize form factor ultrabook 2-in-1 etc. build quality performance battery life? I think my mother doesn't really care for form factor build quality performance are slightly prioritized. How important is weight thinness ? They aren't really important. Do have a preferred screen size? If indifferent put N/A. 17in possible but anything lower than that is also fine. Are doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games desire run. My mother is an architect so she will use a lot of CAD. She doesn't play any games. If 're gaming do have certain games play? At what settings FPS do ? None. Any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ? Mainly 16GB of RAM or at least an empty ram slot an SSD a decent CPU Leave any finishing thoughts here that may feel are necessary beneficial the discussion. My mom has been using a crappy 400€ pc work for a long time she has been struggling work efficiently for a while. For her upcoming birthday me my father wanted buy her a nice Laptop for work. As i said she's an architect so she'll be using a lot of CAD similar programs. I think outside of occasional rendering she doesn't really need an high end GPU. As for the CPU i think an i5 would be fine although an i7 would be nice. I think the most important things for her are a good ammount of RAM she usually has a lot of programs open at the same time. 16GB is enough but 8GB empty slot is also fine a capient SSD for the same reason HHD SSD is also fine .

2,goc8sv,SuggestALaptop,5,2020/05/22 20:06:14,Evening,Suggest a laptop warranty plan? Hi guys thanks some help from this sub I am going buy a razer blade 15 I know it isn't the best laptop for everyone but for what I do it seems perfect . Now I know razer has their fare share of problems along the life of the laptop so I will certainly be purchasing a warranty plan for any mishaps along the ride peace of mind. The two places the best deals are Microsoft BestBuy x200B Microsoft has the blade for 2299.00 the PerformanceGuard Warranty 4 Years for 279 giving a total of 2578 tax. EDIT If I am not mistaken I also get an additional 10% off for being a college student at the MS Store so it could be closer 2300 x200B BestBuy on the other hand has the blade for 1999 GeekSquad 3 year protection for 339 giving a total of 2400 tax. I have heard both good bad things for GeekSquad so I do not know it is my best option x200B Which one would guys say is the better deal? I will be a university student for at least another four years hopefully not more I would like the laptop be functioning all four of those years. Is the 100 less worth it for BestBuy or should I go the Microsoft deal? x200B If either of these are bad choices I can always go a MacBook Pro 13 which fits my budget perfectly but does not have the most power I would have run a VM for solid works all the time

I got sent a coupon for 100 for lenovo havent checked see this is applicabale . All in all this seems like a great option for me. I'm a little wary though. I've heard some horror stories about Lenovo issues customer support as well as shipping times. 2 HP Envy x360 15ee000 touch. 1049 or 1159 depending on the CPU It's got option for AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6 Cores Radeon Graphics 2.375 GHz or the Ryzen 7 4700U 8 Cores Radeon 2GHz I think 4500U will be fine 16GB Ram 15.6 IPS 400 Nits 1920 x 1080. 512GB NVME SSD Intel Wi-Fi 6 or Realtek wifi 5. I think is a great option because of the AMD 5 4500U Radeon which should be able handle all my graphical needs. I'm however not familiar AMD processors will it be enough? I also have no idea what the hell is the difference between each HP envy x360. I see that all the ending get confused what is the difference between 15ee000 touch or the HP envy x360 15-ds0013nr or the best value? This stresses me out In hesitant I'm buying an inferior version or something. I'd be willing link either . I'm leaning more toward the HP because of the Radeon Card hoping avoid Lenovo because I've heard nothing good about customer support from them. Let me know what think.

Im this case I am slightly concerned that the laptop will throttle freeze during the drafting rendering process. What do we think? Just opt for a different laptop or is the base line model for MBA 2020 enough? I don’t have the budget upgrade the RAM 16gb opt for the i5 due the price jump from 1600 2000 here in Australia so I’m kind of stuck the base line model in terms of Macbook Airs. Also is the base line MBA better than the 2019 MBP? My max budget is 1700 AUD so have other recommendations within the price range please let me know. Sorry for the long read thanks in advance 🙂

When I was just a little maggot I remember looking up the Dell XPS line admiration. Their Infinity display was all the roar in those days. I eventually scrapped enough cans buy a 15 inch only later sell it a friend downsize the 13-inch variant. If I only knew how many headaches I could have avoided by purchasing something else. But I liked the lightweight modern feel. Every time I pulled it out of its sleeve I felt like.....I felt nothing. It was just a laptop it was nice compact the battery life was great. Fast forward a year or two because that's how long the damn thing lasted. First the hinge broke I had glue it back together cum crazy glue. That's the only way put it back together I was told. I hated the camera placement but other than that it got worked until it didn't. I didn't like the soldered RAM the only thing user-upgradable was the SSD. So now after removing CMOS battery battery trying turn it on I know that it has internal issues. And it's not the charger. Maybe the motherboard or maybe the father left now I'm a technologically orphaned. These things happen. I'm looking for a cheap or extremely budget-friendly laptop that is reliable. I'll never again touch another XPS for as long as I am human. I prefer buying base models upgrading myself 16GB. I have a 1TB Samsung Evo SSD that I will recycle install in whatever I buy next. All of my life long porn collection personal files are still there although it hurts lose money I no longer have warranty I refuse pay hundreds of dollars fix it would rather keep moving forward never look back. I'm looking for something the latest intel 10th gen 3 or 5 7 is not necessary costs more. More important than it's an IPS screen has upgradable memory storage. budget is definitely below 500 but preferable 300 including taxes. Is eBay my only option? refurbished? Am I trash now?

I bought a 2020 iPad Pro fell in love it I had a GameCube wii emulator on it watched my movies on it. I ended up returning it for a gaming a laptop ASUS Rog G14 but I realize I REALLY miss the iPad Pro..I had a magic keyboard it it was PERFECT. I’m thinking of returning the laptop for getting the iPad Pro maybe a PS4/Xbox one but then I start wonder that the next gen is coming later this year maybe I should just wait? I don’t see much difference of playing games on my laptop other than playing on my tv besides portability..which I don’t really need since I only game in my home. Did I make a mistake returning my baby for a 1 500 gaming laptop? I think the answer is wait for the next gen consoles?

I am pushing into a career involving light video editing adobe suite do a bit of music production / composition on the side. My current refurb SP4 is not doing well keeping up I'm looking purchase a laptop that will last me for the next few years. I am unsure of what is needed for video editing purposes is really where I need help. Coming from a 2-in-1 my research points at the 2020 versions of the ENVY x360 15z the SPECTRE x360 1800 . I am shopping in the US my budget sits at 1800 before tax Envy x360 15z 1300 - Ryzen 7 4700U - 16gb ram - 512gb SSD - FHD Display Spectre x360 15 1800 - 10th gen i7 10750H - NVIDIA GTX 1650ti - 16gb ram - 1tb SSD 32gb Optane - 4k OLED display The storage isn't a concern for me as I already use a good amount of external storage I'm not fussy about displays I don't plan on editing in more than 1080p either . I'm a console gamer but it would be cool do some low end portable gaming here there. I also would much prefer a 15 screen as opposed the 13 models. Although I'm comfortable getting the Envy are there any big considerations get the Spectre instead particularly for future-proofing / video editing? It seems there aren't many reviews for either laptop as both are recent releases but their improvements upon 2019's models seem worth the buy. I am also open the Dell XPS 15 2019 would suggest that instead. This is going be my big pc purchase for the next few years so I'm hoping last a while these machines. It feels like any of these would do the job I'm splitting chin hairs. Your help is greatly appreciated!

The main things it would be used for is video/photo editing streaming video occasionally some light gaming. I’ve been trying do some research myself have been following the recommended system requirements for the editing software that I use Vegas Pro which can be seen here Initially looking at these requirements I was hoping get something at least 16 GB RAM a 7th Generation Intel Core i7 or equivalent or better at least a 15” screen. My budget is between 1000 - 1400 CAD ideally on the lower end of that range but from what I’ve seen I know that may not be possible. Any recommendations on something that might work at this price point? I was eyeballing 2 different gaming laptops the GF63 10SCXR-086CA Thin the Alpha 15 A3DDK-012CA both by MSI but I have no idea it’s a good idea get a gaming laptop the primary purpose won’t be for gaming. I also don’t know much about system specifications besides what is listed in the recommended system requirements for Vegas so I’m at a bit of a loss as what would actually be considered “better” for this situation.

I'm currently weighing up between these two laptops HUAWEI Matebook 13 783 or Dell XPS 13 19 919 - I get 15% off on student discount then a further 100 off on an AMEX deal that's why it is cheaper than the 1199 sticker price.

1,gnvm7y,SuggestALaptop,0,2020/05/22 04:04:07,Night,Dell Xps 17 or MSI Creator 17 miniled? Hi I buy a notebook for outdoor coding Dell XPS 17 Full HD IPS or MSI Creator 17 Miniled. Pros cons Dell Xps 17 looks pro has a vapor chamber however don't have any usb A ports which I use for external keyboard mouse also LAN connection. MSI also has 3 cooling fans also has a brighter display but XPS is also bright has more display area cm2 the display is also taller for about 1 4 cm which is better for coding. Could both laptops be charged thunderbolt from for example powerbank? Can I connect my Dell S2719DC USB-C both of these without plugging charger? If yes then I should plug charger only laptop or monitor because I don't know which one will be charged ? Size of a battery doesn't matter. I can get me 20k A powerbank 65W supply anywhere. Weight is also not a point I can carry heavy backpack it doesn't mind. Can anyone pick up a suggestion ? Thanks
2,gnsrn6,SuggestALaptop,4,2020/05/22 00:08:48,Night,Lightweight laptop mid-range gaming potential I've got two laptops in the house a 4yr old gaming laptop a 2yr old one for family use. The 2yr one just broke it's a Dell apparently needs 300 repair so I figured I'd replace it. This is in the UK . Budget is ideally 1k although I'll go up a bit higher for the ideal machine. Since I don't get the chance get a new laptop very often I thought I'd get something that was okay run games on - I'm not a power gamer but it'd be nice do better than that 4yr old model a 970M graphics card. We don't take laptops out of the house so there's no need for a big battery as we can just plug it in. They do however get taken from room room a lot used on laps so we need something that's light run quietly. I'm aghast at the current fashion for small storage on laptops. I know a lot of people store data on the cloud but that can be inconvenient it's no good for saving large games. Unless I'm missing something here? So something like ... - 15 or 17 light quiet cool running - Dedicated graphics at least around an Nvidia 1650 ideally 1660 - 1TB storage don't care it's HDD or SSD although I'd a small SSD for boot obvs - 16GB of RAM The problem is it's hard get machines a decent graphics card that are light quiet cool running . It also seems quite hard find one a storage drive. Dell have a 14% flash sale on at the moment I'm quite tempted by an XPS 15 1TB SSD 16GB of RAM for 1.3k. But I've heard bad things about Dell's reliability it only has the 1650 graphics card which is a bit weak for the price.

I mostly play League of Legends since that's all my previous device can run but starting play more graphic intensive games like GTA Subnautica WWZ ect. x200B Lenovo lists the 2060 model will be available on their website Heres the Benefits of each I can think of right now Lenovo Legion 5 15 -Just as powerful CPU GPU for cheaper -More storage HHD for video editing -Upgradability one G14 ram is soldered -3ms screen vs 20ms on G14 -Webcam -Keyboard backlight x200B G14 -Much lighter battery charger also much smaller 4.4lbs vs 5.5lbs without charger -Better battery life. -CPU GPU power efficient -Better portability -Cooler design IMO -larger support community for errors -Available now -Built in Meme Machine AniMe Matrix this would be really fun play as a graphic designer x200B Im having a hard time deciding whether the portability Build is worth the screen quality extra storage. does anyone have any input in this? I heard the CPU on the Lenovo is better optimized? Im not so sure

I would appreciate a recommendation for a laptop that will be my only machine. It will be used for everyday/home/personal use Linux software development so a MacBook pro is not a practical option as well as multi-day travel several times a year. No gaming. Here are my wants needs - Keyboard durable firm key activation force at least 1.3mm of travel firm bottoming-out feel not too noisy dedicated Home End PageUp PageDown keys for faster text editing preferably black keycaps preferably dedicated media play/pause forwards backwards keys. Palmrest areas should be metal not plastic or rubbery gummy material i.e. that crap on the Dell XPS . The typing experience is very important as I’m using the keyboard all day. - Screen 400 nits of brightness good refresh rates/no visible ghosting good color reproduction accuracy must have touch functionality I need be able test my other people's work for touch friendliness full HD resolution is preferred but 4K is acceptable no WQHD or other weird resolutions . Size-wise I like 13.3″ – 14″ screen sizes but would consider a 15-incher the case isn’t so big that it impedes portability in a backpack. - Trackpad smooth ideally glass-covered surface large but not too large button is durable will last a long time uses Microsoft Precision drivers on Windows sign of good-quality hardware . - Speakers Reasonably loud quad or more speakers at least two being forward/upward firing ideally some woofers for at least a bit of bass. None of this nonsense shipping two tiny 1 watt down-firing speakers marketing it as an immersive 360 degree surround sound cinematic premium audio experience! - GPU If the machine has a discrete GPU it has be disable-able in the BIOS. Ideally integrated only in particular I'd like avoid a discrete NVIDIA GPU. - Case durable rigid metal ideally doesn't look stupid or blingy or flashy. Needs be easily portable as I will be traveling domestically internationally only a backpack so it can't be too heavy or take up too much space in there. Would prefer at least one full-sized USB-A port. - System/specs optimized for compiling code i.e. multi-core CPU loads. 16 GB RAM 512GB SSD preferred. - Battery life higher is better obviously. My current machine is a 2016 HP Spectre x360 which has met these needs for the past three a half years but is starting fall apart literally from hard use. However the latest model will not work as they worsened the screen the speakers. So far the HP EliteBook x360 1040 Gen 6 is my top choice but its CPU performance is not good which seems especially silly given its high price the AMD 4-series CPUs rolling out right now. Suggestions?

My main purpose for buying the laptop is run CAD software such as Solidworks AutoCAD etc I still do not know precisely which CAD software I will primarily be using yet I understand that the general consensus in the CADing community is that a PC is better run CAD software on. However I have also heard that PCs tend not last very long that a Mac is way more stable. In addition I can use bootcamp/parallels on my Mac which should overcome the problem of CADs needing a windows system. A Mac is a little more expensive than a Dell but it has a longer lifetime the overall experience is better it might be worth the difference. Below I have included the specs for each model. The only main difference is in the processor Intel Xeon vs Intel I9 graphics card Radeon Pro 5500M vs Nvidia Quadro T2000 . Mac model I am interested in Model 16‑inch MacBook Pro Processor 2.4GHz 8‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i9 processor Turbo Boost up 5.0GHz Memory 32GB 2666MHz DDR4 memory Graphics AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 8GB of GDDR6 memory Storage 1TB SSD storage Price 2900 USD Dell model I am interested in Model 15 inch Dell Precision 5540 Mobile Workstation Processor Intel Xeon E-2276M 6 Core Xeon 12M Cache 2.80GHz up 4.70GHz Turbo 45W vPro Chassis Options Intel Xeon E-2276M NVIDIA Quadro T2000 4GB Memory 32GB 2x16GB 2666MHz DDR4 Non-Ecc Memory Graphics Card NVIDIA Quadro T2000 w/4GB GDDR6 Storage M.2 512GB PCIe NVMe Class 40 Solid State Drive Price 3400 USD Does anyone have experience running Solidworks on a Mac using parallels/bootcamp? If so would recommend getting a Mac instead of a PC? If do not why? Is a Mac worth the price difference?

3,gngow8,SuggestALaptop,10,2020/05/21 10:19:03,Morning,Is the new Asus ROG-Zephyrus G14 overkill for my needs? Here it is in case are unfamiliar. I’m looking upgrade semi-soon from my old 2013 macbook pro which did everything I asked of it for the most part but I’d just like a bit more. I would like do a little bit of gaming on it but let me clarify Whatever laptop I get will not be my primary gaming device. I just be able sync an xbox controller it be able play single player games for a few hours maybe on a plane or in an Airbnb or whatever. It would be nice knowing that it could handle anything I could conceivably throw at it but I’m afraid I’d be wasting this laptop’s potential would be better off a more well rounded laptop. I’ve also looked looked at laptops like the newest HP Spectre configured Intel i7 16GB RAM Intel Iris Plus Graphics Or HP Envy x360 which can get AMD Ryzen 7 3700U 16GB RAM Radeon Vega 10 Graphics Could I meet my gaming needs either of these? GTA 5 playing offline...Maybe the newest FIFA game? I’m used console gaming so I don’t need 144hz or extreme high quality graphic settings although I do prefer things looking nice. My new laptop will only be about 10% for gaming. I do like the fact that the G14 can handle just about any program or game the technology in it would hopefully not be obsolete in the next 3-5 years but the HP’s I mentioned which have a webcam great keyboards quiet fans better screens better battery can handle my midlevel gaming needs for the same price it seems that I should lean towards them. Or am I looking at this wrong...Does the G14 have as satisfying of an everyday productivity experience as any other top notebooks? If ignored its gaming capabilities for a moment would it still be a great laptop? Open other suggestions of similar specs price 1500 or lower good aesthetics good battery curious there are any upcoming releases I should keep an eye on. I’m in no rush can be patient for the right device or deal. Thanks all in advance!

3,gnep6g,SuggestALaptop,14,2020/05/21 08:36:22,Morning,2020 XPS 17 2020 Razer Blade 15 or MacBook Pro 16? I have about 2 000-2 500 USD spend on something that will stay on my desk most of the time I already have a surface pro for travel . I live in a cramp place I tend move every year so I'm considering replacing my iMac a 15 inch laptop. Except that now the XPS 17 is smaller than some 15 inch laptops MBP 15 is now the 16 I do a lot of video editing so I something a GPU. I am also thinking about getting into PC gaming too I have a switch but I feel I have a decent PC GPU I might not need a PS5 or Xbox since games on there tend come later the PC . So perhaps something around the RTX 2060 or 2070 which should I go for? my work is also willing buy me a monitor too use externally! Although I like using Mac OS I am leaning towards the XPS 17 or Razer Blade simply because windows has more games.. being a Mac user for a long time.. I am a little bit tired of the same general design a bit. I am curious I would really like the high refresh rate screen of the Razer Blade.. is it really that life changing? . but at the same time worried about its long term reliability due its reputation my work is paying for it but I still it last . XPS 17 Dell might be better in that regard I consider the MBP 16 be the safe choice I will simply just buy it a larger hard drive in order accommodate Windows dual booting for gaming.

USA 2000  -Total budget ideally 2000 - 2500 but flexible it's worth it. -Open refurbs/Used -15 screen preferred. -Aspiring Digital artist -Games Planet Zoo Jurassic World Evolution Tomb Raider Shadow of the Tomb Raider I currently have an ASUS gaming laptop that was top of the line in 2012. It's eight years old 17 screen not portable at all - the battery is fried it needs be plugged in at all times. I play all my favorite games on basically Low or Lowest Settings because it can't handle anything higher. I am also returning school need a somewhat portable pc but I don't mind it's a little bulkier than what others use. I don't buy new PCs very often I would rather invest big for a model that will give me at least 5 years of use. I have gotten every penny out of my ASUS. I a 2-in-1 because I get into digital art I the functionality of a drawing tablet. I would love a rig that would allow me play Planet Zoo or Jurassic World Evolution on ultra high settings so I can really enjoy the beauty of these games. I have been comparing the Surface Book 2 the upcoming Surface Book 3 the Lenovo Yoga C940 The HP Spectre x360 the Dell XPS 15 2-in-1. I've convinced myself the Surface Book is the best for me but am I just falling for good marketing techniques? The Surface Book 3 is the only one boasting 32GB ram which definitely seems worth the investment.. am I wrong? is 256G too small of a memory for what I'm looking for?

Acer Swift 3 - Ryzen 3 4300u APU 8GB Dual channel DDR4 RAM 512GB SSD 14inch IPS FULL HD Screen - 630 euros 2. Lenovo Ideapad 540s - Intel i5-10210U CPU MX250 2GB GPU 8GB dual channel ddr4 RAM 15.6 inch IPS FULL HD SCREEN - 700 euros Mainly the laptop will be used for multimedia will be a travel companion. Sometimes will be used for light gaming older titles like Fallout 3 Mafia 2 indie titles etc. . The Swift 3 is of course a sleek looking device is much more portable. Even though it has a small footprint it still has 7-8 hours battery life according reviews . The ideapad even though it looks a liitle more boring is bigger has the MX250 which I think outperforms the Vega 5 correct me I'm wrong BUT has a 70Wh battery which takes the battery life 10-11 hours. Any kind of thoughts suggestions are more than welcome.

I'm assuming they don't make this model anymore which I don't understand because I ordered this laptop less than 2 years ago. As far as I know it has 4GB of RAM an Intel CORE i5 8th Gen . It can handle basic tasks well but I would like have some fun on it. I know most games I'm interested in require some pretty beefy specs. If I upgrade my RAM will this significantly improve my performance? The computer cost me 800 I don't think I could get anywhere near that I tried sell it. Is there something else I can upgrade? Or am I SOL here? I'm looking for recommendations anything helps! I can post more details about what specs I have needed.

3,gn865y,SuggestALaptop,11,2020/05/21 01:21:07,Night,High refresh vs 4K colour accurate So I’m deciding between a few laptops for the end of the year. The specific laptop will depend on how much they all cost when I actually plan get one. Most of the laptops I’m looking at have an option between high refresh rate whether that be 144hz or 240hz or a colour accurate 4K panel. Whether that be OLED or standard IPS. I’m really conflicted. I used be all for high refresh but when I stopped thought about it I realised that the stuff I’m doing that’ll be important would utilise a 4K panel. This includes game design video editing whereas the high refresh will pretty much only be useful for gaming buttery smooth everyday tasks. This laptop will be for school my parents me use an external monitor at home for ergonomics. This means that this info might transfer over external monitors as well because that’ll be what I will be doing these tasks on.

Hi I have found a deal locally where I can get Acer predator the nitro 5 2019 model for a similar price both new . The models are Predator Helios 300 i5 8300H GTX 1050ti 4GB Nitro 5 i5 9300H GTX 1650 4GB I know that on paper the nitro seems preferable for the same price but reviews say it has some heating issues the predator however comes undervolted overclocked cpu gpu out of the box has better cooling system. Need recommendations for long term usage.
3,gmx87g,SuggestALaptop,5,2020/05/20 13:02:35,Afternoon,I'm looking for a good gaming laptop decent thermal performance VR support. Budget is 1500. So I recently got the ASUS ROG GA502DU-BR7N6 I've had a terrible experience it. Thermal throttling coil whine a lack of VR support due the HDMI port being CPU controlled rather than GPU controlled horrible driver support make me hate it. Before that I was running an Alienware M15 R1 an i7 1660Ti which did support VR seemed run well enough in fact I loved it before I had sell it for rent money. Now I have enough money change systems I was considering going back the Alienware M15 R1 but I'm paranoid about thermals now some reviewers of the M15 R1 have mentioned poor thermal performance. I never noticed any throttling on mine but the current crisis going on the economy being what it is I whatever machine I ultimately wind up getting be reliable for at least the next five years. The M15 R2 looks cool but I don't know it will support my Oculus Rift CV1. Does anybody have good suggestions? I don't necessarily have a brand preference I would even go a different ASUS model it's proven be more reliable.

A friend of mine has a recorded a 20-25 minute video on her Mac QuickTime Player. The thing is she wants edit it but can barely do anything this file as most websites apps say it's too large it's 6 3 Go . She tried iMovie on which she had cut the video down 2 minute extracts edit them one at a time it wasn't functional anyway Filmora works but puts a huge watermark on the middle when she wanted transfer it me an e-mail did obviously not work neither did WeTransfer she couldn't put it on a USB key. She cannot play the video on her computer re-record it a lower quality since she doesn't have enough storage on her Mac for it. You guys are my last hope I think it's really unfortunate that even though she has the video on her computer can view it she has consider deleting it start all over again. Thanks in advance!

I have tried starting in recovery internet recovery mode the same issue. I thought about booting a USB but when booting the OS X Startup manager it presents just a white screen but a mouse cursor that can be moved but doesn't go any further. I am pretty experienced Windows have carried out countless repairs but I don't know much about Macs. My last thought would be take the hard drive out plug it into my Windows PC where i could wipe the drive assuming this is possible then reinstall the Mac OS onto the drive from my Windows PC? anyone has any additional ideas that would be great.

But I’m not sure it will be exactly what I’m looking for because I don’t know too much about hardware. I do 4K video editing generally around 30 min each. Some of my main effects used are image stabilizer color correcting. Basically will this setup be a good fit for what I’m looking for? Is the ram compatible? I’m curious where an egpu would fit in here. Would that help significantly on render time when trying render the 30 min video? Would it be worth it?

So I got this macbook when it came out I just noticed that it had been discontinued it received a lot of bad criticism for its performance. No surprise. Back then I was pretty naive about specs macs wanted the cheapest route but times are different now. The programs Garageband Spotify Minecraft multi apps open I’ve been using heat up my ol mac like hell. It’s sometimes uncomfortable because of how hot it gets even use anymore let alone rest on my lap because of how hot it gets. Don’t even get me started on the battery it drains quickly. Nevertheless it runs terribly slow under a lot of pressure I don’t blame it. It’s not built for that. But I am. I’m busy fellow school gaming doing music production. Sometimes I multitask as well. I upgrade my laptop something more suitable for myself. I was thinking of going for that new MacBook Pro but started debating between 1.4 ghz the i5 processor or the 1.7 ghz the i7. Is there a noticeable difference? I something that’ll last I don’t mind the price but I also don’t waste money for nothing either. I’m wondering there is noticeable difference in anyway. I would appreciate any input thank ! TL DR - Is there a major difference between 1.4 w/ i5 processor 1.7 w/ i7 processor? Cheers!

I don’t know a ton about computers but I’ve been a Mac user forever I’ve had an 11” air since 2014 it’s still in great shape. That said I couldn’t bear edit video on it any longer I’ve cut far too many things on that tiny screen only 4gigs of ram it was quite tedious so I took a big leap this morning after tons of research I ordered my new beauty! Since this is a Mac community I thought I’d share my excitement here curious hear anyone’s thoughts about this particular machine. Thanks everyone!

It's running El Capitan it feels like time for an upgrade. From what I've read Mojave is a safer bet than Catalina. When I got this machine I had the max RAM installed 16 MB I had a second hard drive added. So it's got a 250 GB system drive that has the OS Applications as well as a 1 TB drive for files etc. I'd like do a clean install for the OS because I'm leapfrogging a few versions. Is there anything I need do about all my files on the non-system HD? It seems like the kind of thing that could create headaches I'm not careful. Thanks all.

Unfortunately I bought the MacBook back in August so Best Buy is not gonna take responsibility because it’s past their 30 day return period.

2,gqlges,mac,0,2020/05/26 15:10:46,Afternoon,What Mac should i get? So here is the story i plan use my Mac for school work excel word all of that non intensive work. BUT i do plan on starting do some video editing i plan on using the DJI Mavic Air 2 record at 4K or 2.7k i also have a GoPro Which i always record in 2.7k. Im also planning on installing boot camp just for the fun of it i have two games that I play that’s Age of mythology war of Warcraft they are pretty old ass games but that’s the only reason that i need boot camp. So my question is which one should i get what configurations would work well for me? Here are my following options that I’m considering. Mac Mini i7 1tb ssd for 1600 LG ultra fine 4K. But I don’t deal the EGPu not working on windows boot camp this was my main option but I’ve read so much about how Bootcamp EGPus don’t work. Also I don’t know how hard it is upgrade the ram myself it looks easy but what i mess up? Mac 4K i love the size of the Mac 4K its perfect it just sucks that i have choose the ram while i can do 16 I really future proof it 32gb also the 1tb ssd is expensive the 560x is subpar i would like the Vega 20 but i add all of that I’m getting the 3k mark. Mac 5K the ram is certainly one thing i like about it i wish the 21.5 had a ram door in the back. This ones come the 570 575 the 580x but some of them still come the 8th gen chip. The thing that i like about the iMac is that the GPU is integrated it works perfectly bootcamp as opposed the egpu the Mac mini... there wasn’t any issues the Mac mini bootcamp i would go for that option as it is literally a powerhouse. So what do guys think? What should i get is there an easy way use an egpu in bootcamp how easy is it upgrade the ram?

I think it's one of the most unique things about the Mac. I actually wanted know this is a thing now. Can every model have the bong now or is it just for Catalina? I swear that one of the biggest downside of post-2015 Macs for me is the lack of these tiny thing that made the Mac identity in the past. The glowing Apple Logo the Startup Sound... Actually all the sounds Mac makes. Didn't know I should flag this as Question or Discussion . I wanted confirm but I wanted hear what guys have say. Do like the bong? I love it... I've heard some people actually don't it. I was always the sound kinda guy. I think the little sounds that are sprinkled through the OS makes it way more interesting lively. Anyway have a good one out there!

0,gqn3o8,mac,0,2020/05/26 16:53:47,Afternoon,PSA Logitech MX Keys on MacPro5 1 earlier  The Logitech MX Keys is better than any low-profile keyboard Apple has ever made. The ergonomics build quality functionality supported by Logi Options software is top notch. There are two gotchas however have an old Mac. 1. MacPro5 1 has the Broadcom 2046 chip that only supports Bluetooth 2.1 so macOS will not detect the MX Keys in discovery mode in Bluetooth Setup. But Logitech's got covered a USB 2 Type A dongle that will enable connecting the old Mac the MX Keys via the Logi Options utility. 2. MX Keys has no Eject button open/close the SuperDrive unlike the old Mac keyboards that had one immediately the right of the F12 key unlike some older Logitech K-series Bluetooth keyboards did . An effective workaround is add the Eject icon the macOS menu bar by enabling it in System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Eject.menu. Even select the check box in Logi Options Use all F1 F2 etc. keys as standard function keys MX Keys' F12 does not open close the MacPro's SuperDrive tray. I hope someone finds this useful because I had get Tier 2 support Logitech figure this one out the help of a macOS-savvy support rep.

1,gqlpqo,mac,3,2020/05/26 15:27:17,Afternoon,Is it worth upgrading the logic board on a 2012 Macbook Air? As the title says my MacBook Air mid-2012 1.8ghz i5 4gb is definitely slowing down I've got a 1TB SSD on it already that's only half full. I mostly use it for school work also cloud gaming. But nowadays even just browsing the web is making it slow down. Unfortunately buying a new laptop isn't in my current budget. I have a chance snag an i7 2.0ghz 8gb logic board. Would it make a noticeable difference replacing it this? Is there any way speed up my MacBook without going through the logic board replacement route?

It takes ages for apps open switch between apps save files etc. We’ve barely used any memory on it. The Activity Monitor doesn’t show any particular culprits. Even when I have just one or two apps open it just goes sluggishly. Everything that I look up that say “check see x is slowing it down ” I can’t ever find anything like that. Does anyone have any idea what I might need do get it running normally? I’m at my wit’s end.

1,gqk2ci,mac,23,2020/05/26 13:47:33,Afternoon,There is not a single occasion I have been glad have the touch bar instead of normal function keys. I have the newest Macbook Pro. I've been using it for a while. I expected take some time adjust the touch bar but honestly I figured I'd find it useful at SOME point that simply has not been the case. It is NOTHING but annoying. I have NEVER thought myself Ohhhh! Now I get it! This is actually pretty useful sometimes! The lightest touch my finger which happens quite a bit activates the function or function key I accidentally brush against. I don't disable it entirely because I do actually need use those keys sometimes. It was an interesting idea I can understand why they implemented it but for the love of all that is good decent PLEASE go back normal function keys again!

0,gqjffs,mac,1,2020/05/26 13:10:40,Afternoon,I have a Macbook pro a broken screen. I'm attempting get it display a secondary monitor no luck so far. Where do I go from here try get data off of it? Here's a previous thread on the situation when I first started this task what I've tried so far Long story short this is a friend's 2014 laptop a broken monitor. He doesn't pay get it repaired he just wants try get whatever data is off of it. I've tried get it boot a secondary monitor but everything I've tried so far has failed. I've tried use keyboard commands mirror an external monitor those didn't work. Closing the lid using an external mouse/keyboard in 'clamshell' mode didn't work either. In my latest attempt I was able pick up a set of tools found a guide opening the laptop up I disconnected removed the laptop's monitor. Even no monitor of it's own it's still not connecting my external monitor. We know that the laptop seems be functioning just a broken monitor when the power button is pressed it makes the boot up noise. The only other thing I can think of is trying connect it another mac using 'target disc' mode. Unfortunately we don't have access any other macs try this especially quarantine going on right now. Does anyone have any advice on what I might be doing wrong here? Or any suggestions on what could we try next?

Early caveat I’m not considering the 2020 models because they’re a bit pricey A while back I was gifted a used 15” Mid-2012 mbp have since been using it for iOS development browsing. This has been working ok but it’s rather slow gets VERY hot while I’m compiling code other applications/tabs open. Right now it’s still stock w/ an i7-3615QM 4gb of DDR3 a 500gb HDD. Would I be better off re-applying thermal paste swapping out the HDD for an SSD possibly getting more ram 8 vs 16? or making the jump a newer model? This is the only MacBook I’ve ever owned so I’m not sure what the newer models’ 2016-2019 butterfly switch keyboards are like but I’ve heard they aren’t great. Is that the general consensus? Thanks in advance for your time!

I’ve got a 2015 MacBook Air 13” running Catalina 10.15.4. I got it in the summer of 2016 it’s been used quite a bit as I’m a university student do 25-33% of my courses online. Back in the spring of 2018 my parents upgraded their wifi fibre op. I don’t usually stay my parents anymore the house I live in has older standard-grade wifi I don’t know the specs rn . My university also has very basic wifi. Over the past 7-8 months my computer has increasingly had issues staying connected wifi or even finding networks at all. At first it was ONLY the fibre op my parents had so I assumed it was a network issue as it would drop randomly on our phones tablets my parents iMac etc. The past month I’ve noticed it’s really gotten worse - my laptop will drop the connection at random not pick it back up until the computer has been restarted. Today yesterday it won’t pick up any network not even my nor my brother’s data hotspot. My laptop was serviced back in November for an unrelated issue but I did ask them check the wifi adapter anyway they said it had no issues remained connected on their network no issues. Google is just telling me restart my router restart my computer forget the network reset the SMC done or get it fixed up. Does anyone have any other ideas or suggestions as what do? Thanks!

I have been looking for a new Laptop for a while while there are quite a lot of choices for high spec PCs I am kind of inclined towards getting a Mac but where I live they are really expensive the specs don't even match some PCs for half the price. My question is can I use a Macbook Air or maybe a 13' Pro for work comfortably maybe even run Xcode/Android Studio as I do some Mobile Development or would I need invest in a 3000 Macbook Pro in which case I would get a far more powerful PC for around 1000. I would also like non tech individuals tell me about their experience MacBook Airs how they age how much workload can they handle comfortably. TL DR - is MBA/ 13' MBP good for software development? How much workload can it handle comfortably?

I recently upped the RAM from 16 GB 32 GB swapped out the original 500 GB HDD for a new 1 TB SSD. The gain in performance is very satisfying but I still get dropped frames in FCPX 10.3.4 when dealing original files forcing me trans code all the media generate proxy files for editing. I realize this kind of workaround is a common necessity is precisely the reason why the feature exists but still I find the trans coding part very time-consuming tedious. At one point during the process I thought a faster CPU might help speed up the trans coding process maybe help during the actual editing? . I'm on the fence as doing the CPU upgrade since I've already spent close 400 on other upgrades the actual replacement process requires tearing the machine further apart than I'm comfortable doing myself. Also it would probably be a marginal gain since as I understand it's the GPU the one supposed be doing the heavy lifting here as far as I know the GPU is not really upgradeable meaning I'm stuck the 512 MB stock unit.

It is not EFI locked just iCloud lock Activate Lock . I met this scammer in front of the big restaurant.. hopefully they have a CCTV. The item was in a restoring mode that needs internet connection so I used my mobile hotspot set up. It was taking some time but since I saw his vehicle license number the type/color or car the way he speaks unsuspiciously I thought it should be okay. I gave my money him then he left. Later the Macbook turned on activate lock.. I texted him he can unlock the macbook via icloud.com he never texted back. I tried call but never answered I think he used a virtual number on the app . Before buying it he asked for a cash so I took a screenshot of chat his account info that shows that he is verified by email text messages just in case. I have reported police his vehicle information screenshots summary. I have a police report number now. I'm embarrassed mad sad right now.. what the police can do nothing for it?Have there anyone had a similar experience?

I’m looking at MacBook Pro mid range 2.0ghz 512gb. 16gb RAM. With student discount I could get it for 1.6k am I being daft money should get 8gb Macbook instead for 1.1k?

Although here in India Apple's service system is abso-fucking-lutely garbage. They treat us like Tim Cook when we are buying new products treat us like insects when going in for a repair. If any of guys have gotten their Mac's battery replaced could tell me the price of the replacement? I would prefer Indians reply this so that they tell me in my currency but either way anyone can reply really. Also dont recommend third party batteries DIY replacement of those because battery is the last thing I risk .

I wanted use this SSD in my Mac Pro. I got the SSD out of the enclosure. Put it in the Mac Pro drive bay but I got a prohibited sign. I taught the problem was I was using Sierra the Mac could only run El Cap. So I used an El Cap usb installedrive but when I install the OS I don't see any drives install it on. Also in Disk Utility no sign of an SSD at all... So then I put in my good old Snow Leopard DVD yes then I could see the SSD install OS X 10.6.8! Now I taught upgrade El Cap by downloading the El Cap installer from the Apple Support site. But when the machine reboots go the installer I get the prohibited sign again... Maybe a bad SSD but it works fine in 10.6 in external enclosures. So it has be the Mac Pro. I put in an old 640gb HDD this drive doesn't get detected as well. In System Information I can see the drive in the correct drive bay but it says 'unknown'. So weird it works Snow Leopard but not at all El Capitan. Any ideas? Thanks!!

3,gq386z,mac,15,2020/05/25 19:06:24,Evening,Potential ARM update in 2021... age-old question on whether or not hold off. I have a 2014 MacBook Pro 2.5 GHz 16GB RAM 750M GPU 1TB updated SSD . It's in good shape basically everything has been replaced on it through Apple repairs except the top case the battery. The battery definitely does not serve my needs when I take it out as it has atrophied over time 180 cycles over 6 years down 85% capacity . I may be in a place where I can buy a new MacBook Pro. I would definitely go for a 16 MBP at least 2TB of SSD 32GB of RAM the second-highest tier processor. With AppleCare it's looking like a 4 000 laptop. With this techie buzz about Apple potentially updating displays Mini-LED potentially switching over ARM-based processors in 2021 I'm a little weary about spending that much cash on a laptop. On the upside I know Boot Camp will continue work on it whereas it will be highly improbable not impossible that an ARM processor will run Windows. Thoughts?

Both are still running decently well but are beginning show their age. I am now looking for possible ways upgrade this setup. Since I have not quite been keeping up hardware I am hoping for feedback sanity check this. My requirements are Faster than either of my current machines Ethernet supply dedicated graphics. I am mostly using my Macs for writing programming RAW development but the occasional video game should not be out of the question. Ideally I avoid an iMac because the new models do not let me get at the internals as easily as my current model upgradeability for RAM Storage is quite low. I do not go eGPUs as the current generation seems tax the capabilities of the connector already so this does not seem very future proof. Also I am not a huge fan of dongles. Mac Pro 6.1 Pro User-Upgradeable CPU Storage Memory. Dedicated Graphics Runs the current version of OSX without patching Con Quite expensive for the performance The GPU is fairly bad apparently Spare parts are very expensive Mac Pro 5.1 Pro User-Upgradeable anything I can re-use existing legacy components SATA disks With a fairly modern GPU a CPU Upgrade the machine is still quite capable today Parts components are easily available Fairly inexpensive Con Upgrading an even older design old hardware lessens reliability Not officially supported on Catalina Might put me into the same situation in 1-2 years Macbook Pro 16 Pro Fairly powerful machine dedicated graphics Will replace both of my machines Docking via USB-C seems be the way go for the future Con Non-serviceable Battery powered devices go obsolete faster Dongle-Hell get all useful ports I am currently leaning towards the 6.1 despite the machine being comparably bad because it seems that this configuration might meet my needs for some 5 years or so enabling me switch whatever Apple might have released until then. The 5.1 is quite tempting as it appears that I can easily build a machine that matches or surpasses the 2013 in performance without being nearly as expensive. But software support might break forcing me upgrade earlier Am I totally wrong?

If have Bluetooth Headphones might of noticed that the audio quality is reduced while using the Microphone. You have use the Internal Microphone or a USB Microphone remedy the issue. This is almost as outrageous as Car Manufacturers being unable implement Bluetooth into their vehicles correctly Printer Manufacturers being unable implement Wi-Fi into their printers correctly or Smart TV Manufacturers being unable implement Wi-Fi into their printers correctly. It's about time the Wi-Fi Alliance Bluetooth SIG regulate the use of their technology in devices.

Hi all I have a MacBook Pro late 2011 that I bought start producing music for my own project. It has worked very well all these past 8 years but lately I have been relying more more on plug ins my laptop has been crashing often in the middle of working on a track. I have been considering in buying more plug ins I know it’s going demand a higher end computer. I don’t move around a lot. I am always working on music at home that is why I am probably considering an iMac instead of a MacBook. Specially in these times when meeting face face is not ideal. Besides portability why would I a MacBook instead of an iMac? Also I am willing spend around from 1k 1 300 dollars. I am interested in buying plug ins for bass for drums. I already bought a guitar amp simulator plug in. In case guys ask I don’t write electronic music I write instrumental Metal Rock music.

I needed some advice on how proceed a repaireplacement. TLDR at bottom. I bought a new 15 MBP Retina in July 2019 in the last few weeks I noticed a lot of fan noise as well as the laptop significantly slowing down/heating up. I did some research was told it was a possible fan problem. I opened up the laptop safely both fans were dusty as hell. I cleaned them compressed air made sure everything looked clean. I put the bottom back on without anything hitches went charge it. This is when the charger kept connecting disconnecting. I tried resetting the SMC but still no avail. I reopened it see there was dust that I missed when I did a few minutes later I heard a hissing sound. I put the back plate on put in the charger. No charging sound no charge. It's a busted battery I have send it in for a replacement. Since no Apple Stores near me are open I'll have mail it in. Will they just replace the battery or will they send me a new laptop? Also would the turn around time be longer than normal due COVID? TLDR I have get my MBP battery replaced/fixed. Do I just file AppleCare mail it in? Do I get a new laptop or this one a replaced battery? Thanks.

1,gpw70t,mac,0,2020/05/25 11:55:44,Morning,Looking for clipboard software specific features finding it hard find do know of one like this? With my recent update from El Capitan Catalina a utility I've depended on for nearly the entire time OS X has existed stopped working I'm looking for a replacement. I see a number of clipboard managers out there but most of them are focused on saving a history of many past copies so can paste old ones which is not what I . I wouldn't mind having that capability it's just not what I care about. But all the heavily-featured clipboard managers have such long lists of features that I find it hard tell they have the few I care about all the really simple ones such as plain clip do not. What I most Lets me pop up a simple window that shows what's currently in the pastebuffer lets me edit it right there. Hotkey make that window appear is configurable - so I can have it be cmd-shift-C which is what is already embedded in my habits from many years. Some automatic transformations available so that I can do them without hand-editing. In particular - Strip formatting I'd like be able have this as a default so I just bring up the box click save changes formatting is stripped - Convert 7-bit ASCII... do it smartly . For example convert c œ oe em-dash regular dash smart quotes regular ASCII quotes so on. Other transformations could be nice too but those two are the ones I really care about. I something that stays out of the way unless I choose use it but comes up quickly the click of a hotkey the key combo of my choice shows me what's in the pastebuffer lets me edit it I a single click transforms what's in the pastebuffer unformatted plain ASCII text. I've been reading through the marketing buzz feature lists of a bunch of clipboard managers so far haven't found one that definitely does the above though I have found a few that might I could buy them one by one try each one. But I really hope someone here knows one or at least can tell me which of the popular ones don't do what I so I can save time trying them.

Now in 2020 my sister is getting a new laptop I noticed that the max speed could get was capped at 2.0ghz 3.8ghz turbo boost.

3,gppa48,mac,2,2020/05/25 04:58:10,Night,I think it’s finally time replace my 2013 13” MacBook Pro... but what? So I’m facing a Macbook dilemma... My faithful 13” MacBook Pro has 8GB of RAM the base duel core Intel i5 a 512GB SSD. It’s reaching a point where it’s having difficulty keeping up some tasks like editing photos in Affinity Photo editing 4K footage in iMovie or even just making video calls browsing the web. My battery life tops out at maybe 2-3 hours my hard drive always seems be short on space. I told myself I wouldn’t upgrade my MacBook until Apple fixed the butterfly keyboard. Then the 16” MacBook Pro came out everyone loved it talked about how great it was how it’s the best Macbook in years blah blah blah. Then rumors of a 14” Macbook replacing the 14” like how the 16” replaced the 15” started circulating I thought “great! here comes a new laptop like the 16” pro in the smaller form factor I like. But then this new 13” comes out sure it has a new keyboard but it still has this dated screen last gen processors unless spring for the top end model. It feels like kind of just... there compared the 16.” Now it looks like my options are a larger more expensive but very competent laptop or a smaller but more lackluster one. I’ve always preferred my 13” over the 15” I used carry for work but these days my MacBook barely ever leaves the house while my iPhone iPad have become my go mobile computers. This has me wondering I should sacrifice portability for the larger 16” screen discreet graphics. My choices are down a top end 13” MacBook Pro the 10th generation processor at least 16GB of RAM a 1TB SSD or a base model 16” a similar configuration. I try hold on my computers for a pretty long time so I need something that will hold up the next decade of personal photo video work I can throw at it. Which laptop is better for my workload?

If I have it move fonts then maybe it's pulling fonts out of where they're supposed be I just leave OS X system fonts Adobe fonts where they're supposed be but I have it copy fonts then I'm taking up 2x the space for the same amount of fonts. I like Font Explorer X because I'm familiar it.

English Hello everyone a few days ago I had a problem my 2012 MacBook Pro although I have made some inquiries tests I cannot solve it the problem is the next a few days ago after having the Microsoft Word program open which had been running for a while on my computer for a while I tried close it but it left the computer frozen the color wheel in the cursor I had force it quit the program when it failed I forced shut down the computer after that when I turn it on at very random times it freezes temporarily the damn color wheel on the cursor. Obviously I have investigated on my own before asking here ... the logical thing think is that it is a RAM or PRAM failure following advice from technical support I have restarted the computer Option Cms P R for 20 seconds but that has not eliminated the problem. I also removed the entire Microsoft programs but it persists. So I wanted ask Can think of any possible cause for this? Before this episode my computer worked perfectly in this regard. Español Hola a todos hace unos días me surgió un problema con mi MacBook Pro de 2012 y aunque he hecho algunas averiguaciones y pruebas no consigo solucionarlo. El problema es el siguiente hace unos días después de tener un tiempo abierto el programa Microsoft Word Que desde hacia un tiempo funcionaba algo lento en mi ordenador lo traté de cerrar pero dejó el ordenador congelado con la ruleta de colores en el cursor tuve que forzarlo a salir del programa y al no conseguirlo force a apagar el ordenador después de eso cuando lo enciendo en momentos muy aleatorios se queda temporalmente congelado con la maldita rueda de colores en el cursor. Obviamente he investigado por mi cuenta antes de preguntar aquí... lo lógico es pensar que es un fallo de la RAM o PRAM y siguiendo consejos del soporte técnico he reiniciado el ordenador con el Option Cms P R durante 20 segundos pero eso no ha eliminado el problema. También quité todo el tema de Microsoft pero el problema persiste. Asi que quería preguntar Se os ocurre alguna posible causa para esto? antes de este episodio mi ordenador funcionaba perfectamente en este sentido.

This one is 100 more expensive than another which is 2.5GHz. Are they the same? MacBook pro11 5 . The more expensive one also has i7 6th gen but the other one has i7 5th gen. Any difference?

I'm hoping upgrade from El Capitan 10.11 Sierra 10.12 in order use some new software that isn't compatible my current OS. So what's the best way of creating a backup in case the new OS breaks things? Normally I would just take the chance figure it out later something did break but since quarantine I've been using my personal machine for work I really need be able revert back in the event that my work programs don't play nice Sierra they probably will but can never be too careful .

And the Right Edge of the screen will be directly next that. I originally thought it was related waking - but it happened me this morning while sitting here using the MacBook. Mouse tracking works as expected - That is say that I started the mouse at the Left Edge see representative image below went right - it would travel off the actual monitor enter the left side of the monitor continue the Right Edge then once it hits that imaginary red line I drew it travels onto my 2020 MacBook Pro's monitor as expected. If I unplug the USB-C HDMI cable then plug it back in it returns normal. x200B Representative Image - imaginary Red Line show the split Has anyone experienced this should I be worried?
2,gpobwo,mac,4,2020/05/25 03:43:05,Night,Buying 2020 MBA Hi guys. Looking for some advice. I’m going be buying a new MacBook this year. I’ve decided on the MacBook Air the i5 quad core. This seems be the sweet spot for processors. I’m struggling decide which ram get. I am a fairly light user of a laptop. General browsing listening music/ podcasts YouTube Netflix casual photo editing/ sorting football manager. So my thoughts are 8gb will be plenty an extra 200 probably wouldn’t be worth it for the 16gb. But I am worried this doesn’t future-proof the laptop. After all splashing out over 1k on a laptop I it last a while!! Any advice would be helpful 👍

5,gpf42j,mac,3,2020/05/24 15:33:38,Afternoon,New iMacs are coming... Small reminder that it's been 430 days since the last iMac release average is 383 days . That can only mean we have brand-new iMacs incoming! When ask? I'll bet a hundred clam-chowders that new iMacs will be announced June 22 at WWDC 2020. So what could these new iMacs bring? 10th-generation Comet Lake desktop processors At the top of the list is the flagship Core i9-10900K that Intel calls the world's fastest gaming processor. The i9-10900K features 10 cores a base frequency of 3.7 GHz while Intel's Thermal Velocity Boost can push single-core speeds 5.3 GHz. It's also the successor the i9-9900K chip currently used in the highest-end ‌iMac‌ configurations so it's likely the new chip will make its way into Apple's lineup. Natural replacements for the 21.5-inch ‌iMac‌ lineup include the new Core i3-10100 Core i5-10500 Core i7-10700 while the 27-inch iMacs would see the Core i5-10500 Core i5-10600 Core i5-10600K in addition the high-end i9 option. New low-priced 23-inch-sized design Apple plans introduce a 23-inch iMac in the second half of 2020 mass production set begin in the third or fourth quarter according a China Times report spotted by Mac Otakara. Apple could likely achieve this display size by simply reducing the thickness of the bezels on the current 21.5-inch iMac. The report claims that the new iMac will be one of several lower-priced products that Apple introduces this year including the new iPhone SE a forthcoming 11-inch iPad also expected in the second half of 2020. I don't know much about China Times' rumor reputation but even Gurman says rumors of a 23-inch iMac sound about right. New GPUs I'm excited for new GPUs but I don't follow AMD news so anyone knowledge of what new GPUs the new iMacs will use I will add that in an edit here credit . Thanks! -- With more more people working from home for some of us it may be time add a Mac desktop the family. I was thinking of upgrading my aging 15-inch a 2020 16-inch MBP also incoming but I feel a little silly buying laptops keeping them in clamshell mode since I work from home no longer do client on-sites. I'm very excited for the new iMac.

The 2012 had a faster processor I think the logic board failed. I can still access the files on the drive from an external mount so I guess it’s okay. The older one failed last night it seems like it’s a drive problem. My question is I install the drive from the 2012 might the 2010 boot up? I know nothing is certain just looking for some insight.

This is my first Apple device so I've had learn how use it whilst debugging it. I work in tech have been an engineer for years so I'm not new figuring out issues I like get the root cause. The issue appeared on day one I contacted Apple on day three. Issue Symptom When I use an external USB-C hub in any port of my MBP connect USB 2.0 devices that include a Filco keyboard a Razer DeathAdder mouse... after a while minute or hours the USB 2.0 devices will stop responding keyboard dead mouse not moving or clicking . Debugging Maybe it's the USB-C hub? So I have used StarTech 7 port USB-C hub 5x USB-A 2x USB-C Satechi USB-C hub 3x USB-A 1x Eth 1x HDMI 1x USB-C power in Anker USB-C hub 4x USB-A Using any of those hubs the 2 USB 2.0 devices attached at some point the devices will freeze up. Unplugging inserting the USB-C hub does not solve it. Maybe it's one of the USB-A USB 2.0 devices? So I have used Filco Majestouch keyboard by itself still freezes Razer DeathAdder by itself still freezes Both of the above all of the USB-C hubs I have still freezes Then a minor breakthrough If I put the mouse in any USB-C hub put the keyboard in any other USB-C hub connect these any Thunderbolt USB-C ports... the USB 2.0 devices still freeze across all hubs at the same time This is confusing... as it were 1 device or 1 hub I would not expect a synchronisation of it freezing across all USB 2.0 devices. Note that I am highlighting USB 2.0 devices as the USB 3.0 USB 3.1 devices I have connected at the same time like an Elgato Camlink... are unaffected continue function normally even when connected via a USB-C hub that has USB 2.0 devices attached that have become unresponsive. So starts the research SMC Reset - does nothing... problem recurs reboots SMC resets both resolve the issue temporarily but it will recur within minutes or hours. I contact Apple SMC Reset - still fruitless Press d whilst it boots run diagnostic all good - devices still freeze a bit later Left Option Left Comment or was it Control? P R - this is safe mode - still the issue appears Disk Utility First Aid - all good but still devices hang Create a test user login as that does it happen? Yes Apple support person it still happens Reinstall operating system - this is day four since receiving the new MacBook Pro I've only installed Chrome Firefox... but sure - as expected the issue remains. Apple provide a Capture Data.dmg utility looking at this it's a script that just collates everything logs pcaps top process information everything... I run this my surprise the issue occurs whilst it is running. I send the capture data 311MB as a .dmg file Apple Support. In the meantime something nags me... that earlier discovery that USB 2.0 devices freeze even across different simultaneously connected USB-C hubs. This is weird suggests it's the Mac not the hubs or devices. So I start view Apple logo About this Mac System Report before during after this happens refreshing the view constantly. What I notice here is that USB 2.0 devices behave normally until they become unresponsive but then as soon as they are unresponsive they will forever remain in the System Information even unplugged from the hubs or re-inserted. This applies all USB 2.0 devices. Anything that shows up as USB 3.0 behaves normally. I also notice that every one of these USB-C hubs shows a VIA Labs USB2.0 hub as the parent for the USB 2.0 devices. Then a minor discovery on a forum I found someone mention that they see an issue almost identical that they have a workaround which is use the USB hub in their monitor. So I order another USB-C hub my 4th in a week a CalDigit TS3 . I plug in the CalDigit look at System Information now my USB 2.0 devices are showing up as USB 3.0 devices connected the Apple USB 3.0 hub. I use this the issue does not recur at all... it's fixed. Hypothesis Apple has a USB 2.0 issue either the chipset they are using or a Catalina bug regarding the handling refreshing of USB 2.0 devices. However this can be worked around. USB-C hubs vary in their functionality there are two types 1. USB hubs that are transparent proxies 1. The Anker Satechi StarTech hubs 2. USB hubs that are terminating proxies 1. The CalDigit hub anonymous person on the internet their monitor hub Transparent proxies take the USB 2.0 input present it as USB 2.0 the MacBook Pro. The Mac or Catalina then will do something wrong the USB 2.0 devices will freeze / become unresponsive at some point minutes or hours after being attached . Terminating proxies take the USB 2.0 input terminate it present it as a fresh input that is USB 3.0 the MacBook Pro. Everything is good in this scenario. Affected Apple Devices I know my MacBook Pro 13 2020 is affected a friend has verified a new MacBook Air is also affected. For both the workaround of finding a USB-C hub that presents USB 2.0 devices as USB 3.0 devices works. What have Apple said? That they cannot see any issue in the data collected my analysis even knowing the correct timestamp of when the issue occurred during data collection is that only 1 log file showed evidence of the issue... a single line showing that Google Chrome browser suddenly didn't see the USB keyboard has switched the Apple keyboard . Apple also say that they have received no other support calls that relate this. I got the feeling that they think this is a user error. Related Links These are links I found that hint that the issue is more widespread Conclusion I have a workaround so I'm happy now love my first ever Mac. But I'm pretty sure other people aren't going buy 4 USB-C hubs work through what the root cause is how workaround the problem. So I'm putting this information on Reddit hoping that others who experience it can self-verify whether this is the same issue communicate that Apple Support so that Apple prioritise a fix. Also make it discoverable by Google so that people are looking for a resolution this issue they find this can see a workaround is possible. I do super recommend that CalDigit USB-C hub btw... I hadn't bought that my entire Apple experience wouldn't have survived a week now I think it will last years.

But I am having a screen flickering problem recently these past 2 months. Did not have this before no water spillage. Normal startup didn’t show any flickering at all. My OS is High Sierra 10.13.6. This is when I use Chrome as a browser go on Apple’s website. Flickering in the navigation bar. URL Search bar has a white box some where near the end. When I use VLC as a video player sometimes audio will suddenly go off screen flickers the app will freeze. These are the troubleshoot steps I have done the problem still persists. I have done these individually restarting my mac. Disabled Hardware acceleration in Chrome. Disabled graphics rasterising in Chrome. 1. Reset PRAM tried chime once three times on startup. 2. Reinstalled individual apps going on the sites problem. Still flickering. 3. Reset SMC but power cable doesn't change light but fan is quieter4. Start MAC in safe mode screen still flickering. Loading user account from start up had flickers. Safari had little flickers. But Chrome was the worst. 5. Done a hardware test no problems at all on the list. 6. Clean install the Mac system from Recovery Mode formated HDD reinstalled OS. 7. Installed system updates Reinstall all apps still flickering launch from safe mode still flickering. I really don't know what the problem is. Do I need replace the screen? Buy a new mac? Since it’s 9 years already.... Switch Safari never use Chrome? I live in the UK. Since everyone's self distancing very hard go apple or find a laptop repair shop that is open. I am forever grateful anyone can help. Or even better tell me I don’t need replace something so sentimental me. Thanks

1,gpe5oc,mac,5,2020/05/24 14:34:54,Afternoon,How big is the battery difference between the baseline Air baseline Pro any? Evening everyone Due an unfortunate circumstance I’ve had recently a Dell laptop of mine I am currently in the market for a new machine. As my working environment is quite mobile having good battery life is a must for me. I noticed that the current MacBook Air has a smaller battery by about .4wH compared the previous model 49.9wH vs 54wH which is certainly perplexing. Normally I would have gone the baseline Air called it a day but that’s when Apple up released an updated version of the MacBook Pro. The Pro has a significantly larger battery at 58wH compared the Air but it also has a more powerful processor boot. Assuming that the load between the two would be similar writing documents / emails web surfing entertainment consumption would the battery life on the Pro be slightly better due its higher capacity? Thanks so much for all of your insight!

1,gpaxj9,mac,2,2020/05/24 11:26:14,Morning,I have Macbook Pro 2011 dual drive - Which Macbook get next? I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro 13 1TB HDD in place of optical drive 128gb SSD. I've been very happy this setup because I have a lot of music TV-series I personally hate external drives every single one I've had got corrupted at some point I would need regularly plug them in back them up on DropBox that's even possible... Now I've gotten fed up my Mac I can't install High Sierra 13 I still have 12.6. I can't import any videos from my iPhone OS 13.5 . My SSD which contains my system keeps going haywire denies me permission do anything on the drive until I restart. Spotlight doesn't always work. Every time I start my Mac I see some weird matrix kinda shit my user account image is missing a piece. To me this all indicates my Mac won't last much longer. I think it's time I get a newer 2nd hand Macbook pro but which one? I would like have at least 1TB memory pay less than 1k USD or euro but still have SSD for faster system. If I have go for a newer model I guess my only option is a single SSD drive but have 1TB SSD would probably cost too much. So here's what I've thought of 1. Buying a 2012 Macbook Pro 13 . I've understood this is the last model that has an optical drive is also compatible newer OS but they don't seem very abundant right now. I also thought perhaps in the long term this is not the best solution. 2. I can see 2015 models on sale 2nd hand so I was thinking buying one 128gb SSD. I've understood I should be able replace the SSD drive pretty easily in 2015 models so i could buy a 1TB SSD separately install it myself I've done it before . This way the total price would still be a little under 1k whereas buying a 2015 model SSD 1TB would cost around 1 3k 2nd hand. Any recommendations or opinions are much appreciated!

Posting in case anyone else has had trouble playing games has spent days looking for answers. Enjoy the pretty Mac picture D All of this information came from this website The answer I finally found was restore from the internet. I spent days looking for ways revert High Sierra. Nothing in the Steam store would work Catalina. If I upgrade I'm sure I can. You can create a boot disk High Sierra so long as once purchased it or can use a Patcher hit the 'Download High Sierra' try use Terminal create boot disk using createinstalldisk commands. This is probably gonna save a ton of time 1 Back up everything. 2. Back up everything another drive. Seriously don't trust one drive keep everything safe. They're 40 a TB throw one in the cart when 're getting rotisserie chickens mashed potatoes. 3. After 're 100% certain 've backed everything up proceed. Do so caution. This will erase 're entire hard drive restore it back the pristine condition it arrived in. Not for the feint of heart - like some orange blob once said 'I take no responsibility.' Directly from MacWorld The first approach is use a feature called Internet Recovery. Newer Macs are able boot directly from an internet connection even no Recovery partition available. Here is how use MacOS Internet Recovery Shut down your Mac. Hold down Command-Option/Alt-R press the Power button. On some Mac keyboards the Option key will be named Alt . Hold down those keys until a spinning globe the message Starting Internet Recovery. This may take a while . The message will be replaced a progress bar. Wait for it fill. Expect it take a while... Wait for the MacOS Utilities screen appear. Click Reinstall macOS follow the installation process. There are issues Internet Recovery. It only works networks using WEP WPA security. This is most home Wi-Fi networks but 're on a proxy network or PPPoE then will have problems. In these cases it's usually best find another network rather than create a USB Recovery Stick our next step . If have Internet Recovery then make use of it reinstall macOS possible. If need more information hit the link. ⌘-F. This is buried deep in the page.

1,goyhiw,mac,7,2020/05/23 20:09:38,Evening,2012 Mac Mini build idea good? Bad? I’ve got an old 2012 Mac Mini i5 1TB 8gb RAM collecting dust I turn it into a file server Plex host. I just found out that I can install a second HDD the thing so I’m thinking of putting in a 250gb SSD having macOS run off of that while the original 1TB sits in there for storage. Any additional storage could just be an external drive plugged into the back. I figure an SSD running the OS the 8gb RAM is already good enough for all I’m asking. I understand how taking apart upgrading the machine works but is it difficult on the software side? I’ve never had a Mac 2 hard drives. How do I ensure that the OS gets installed runs off the the SSD instead of the 1TB? Also is it difficult turn this thing into a file server Plex media host?

1,goxot5,mac,6,2020/05/23 19:12:36,Evening,My MacBook Air is running poorly I have absolutely no clue why. A couple of days ago my MacBook started acting strangely. It has a much harder time running applications that worked fine before Minecraft Chrome Photoshop etc. I have no clue why. I haven't installed anything that could be a virus malware or anything of the sort I did a virus scan of my computer it came back fine. I'm fairly certain that it isn't because my hard drive is running out of space as it's run fine only a GB or two of space left I have 32.25 GB of free space. I don't think it's a problem RAM storage although it very well might be. I tried resetting my SMC I don't think it did anything. Nothing has changed as far as I can tell it's really annoying having Chrome crash 10 tabs open. I've also been having an issue where the graphics go completely whack pop-up menus being empty windows being completely black the like. I can simply restart my computer fix it so it's not a large issue but it started at the same time as the slowdown so it's probably connected in some way the problem. If need any more information I would be happy provide it. Thanks in advance anyone who tries help! NOTE My computer is a school laptop certain functions may be blocked. Although there are very large files I have downloaded that I can't uninstall I've had them for a while so they most likely aren't the root of the problem. Even this prevents the problem from being solved I can hopefully contact my school's IT department have them fix it.

1,goxf6k,mac,2,2020/05/23 18:54:13,Afternoon,Question about resource sharing on the i3 Mac Mini - Thunderbolt Ports / PCIe lanes / etc... I have a Mac Mini 2018 i3 model. But it still has 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports seeing as that’s one of the reasons I bought it I’m trying use them as actual TB3 ports not just USB-C. I was testing GPU rendering a pair of GPUs in external TB3 enclosures .... it actually works! For around an hour... then the little Mac just seems give up the cards stop being recognized the whole system gets glitchy. Feeling frustrated. I’m not really blaming Apple since it’s probably more down the way the i3 has PCIe lanes routed it rather than any design choice that Apple made but something is advertised 4x of something that implies that I can use them all at the same time - Does anyone know the i7 version would perform better? I’m thinking the i7 may have more directly connected PCIe lanes while the i3 is probably reliant on data switching lane sharing from the TB3 controller through the chipset then the CPU. I suspect this because I observed that while plugging in the 2nd GPU while it was recognizing the new hardware the NIC dropped my network connection as though it had been briefly unplugged leading me suspect that the I/O on the Mac Mini has very few dedicated paths the CPU. Anyone have experience running thunderbolt enclosures on a Mac Mini?

3,goqa7q,mac,5,2020/05/23 11:41:40,Morning,HELP 2012 MacBook Pro suddenly slowed an unusable state was working perfect days ago. -Mid 2012 MacBook Pro 13 inch currently on 10.13.6 16gbs of ram the stock 500gb hard drive I tried using my MacBook the last few days it has began experiencing problems. It all started when google chrome absolutely would not load a webpage but all of my system apps were working fine. I tried restarting many times but it would never clear the problem. Chrome would cause my system jam up become unusable until I force closed it. It’s been a while since I’ve reset it the hard drive only had 40gbs free at the time so I figured I’d give that a shot. Got it back barebones MacOS 10.13.6 it was actually working a lot better yesterday I was thinking that may have fixed it. Started out using safari it was loading webpages everything just fine. But now today I’m currently trying use it it is so bad. Can’t even get through system settings without pinwheeling every time I click on something can’t even see activity monitor or shut the beast down in this current state. What are these signs of? Is this a possible hard drive problem? This MacBook has performed flawlessly every day for me for the last 4/5 years through heavy light usage alike but I have taken excellent care of it. If it’s just a hard drive I would gladly take it as an excuse upgrade an SSD. Im not ready give this thing up yet it still works like a dream!

I can make purchases on Apple TV edit most of my account access my iTunes but I can't setup 2FA or log into appleid.apple.com make manage my account. When I go reset the questions on the iforgot apple site it says my account doesn't have enough information do this. Since I have access my most of my account does anyone know the information I need enter get the reset prompts populate? Apple support was pretty much useless. They said wait 24-48hrs I should get a prompt eventually reset my questions by confirming the CC details I entered on my account but it's been a few days nothing has changed. I read some other posts but the suggested fixes didn't seem work this is my only apple device. Does anyone know a way fix this issue? Did I miss something during initial setup? I get that apple takes security seriously but this just seems too far also not that good since I can still access my most sensitive info CC banking info make purchases. Thanks in advance

5,gok71y,mac,0,2020/05/23 06:19:34,Night,It's Backup Friday!!! If 're reading this 're not backed up don't let the weekend go by without fixing that. You can prevent a lot of drama heartache through a few small actions today! Time machine makes it super easy back up your apps settings files. All need is an external. Externals are cheap as hell compared lost data. Don't worry about the speed can't afford a fast one- it can run overnight for as long as it needs run. Look for double your HDD in terms of capacity. Time machine also does versioning so that file as it was 6 months ago instead of today can do that. Bootable backups are nice as well. With a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner or similar can put an image of your HDD on an external. If your internal dies boot from your external it's just like nothing bad ever happened. Offsite/cloud backups are also a thing. iCloud lets store things. There are also services like Backblaze that let back up any drive connected your computer download the files from the web or receive a restore drive in the mail. If your house burns down are your files safe? The monthly or annual fee on these services is trivial compared the cost of lost data. If have other suggestions comment below please! If 're not backed up yet get backin'!!!!!! Order a drive on Amazon. Get Best Buy curbside pickup. Strap up brave the local Wal Mart. Research cloud services subscribe one. GO!
1,goupbn,mac,6,2020/05/23 15:53:17,Afternoon,What am I doing wrong in this Mac OS installation? A friend of mine brought his iMac mid-2010 me today the hard drive removed a new SSD installed in it physically. I've been dealing Windows for over 10 years but only have been messing Mac OS for about 2-3 years. That being said I feel like I am missing something here. I surely created the boot drive properly installed High Sierra a USB after I formatted the drive via cmd installed High Sierra the USB. I removed the SSD from the iMac plugged it into my Macbook Pro via USB adapter erased formatted it GUID whatnot. I put the SSD back into the iMac plugged in the flash drive. I hit the option key bring up the boot menu. I was left a white screen. I imagine this is a simple fix. Would installing the High Sierra dmg the SSD work? Something else? I'm unsure can't find help on YouTube/Google. Thank all in advance!

1,gotwqx,mac,0,2020/05/23 15:04:46,Afternoon,Help Most of my user files have vanished. Hey. Not sure this is the best place for support advice but not please point me in the right direction. I’m using a 2015 MBP running latest macOS version. This evening I noticed some of my picture files were missing then I had a deeper look noticed all of my photos many of my random files documents images located on desktop in various user folders had vanished. Every affected folder had the same “last modified” time stamp which was two hours previous. My first instinct was malware/ransomware. But all I was doing at the time was editing an audio file emailing that file all using legit/uncracked software. I’m pretty careful about what software I use but obviously I can’t rule malware out 100%. Although I got no ransomware pop up window. Must be some kind of file corruption right? But it’s strange that it’s only user files but not all user files not any system files that I can see. Also strange that it all happened at the same time which would correspond the time I woke the Mac from sleep. The only other thing I noticed was shortly after I started using the Mac this evening a massive 90GB time machine backup started. This is unusual as it backs up regularly usually less than 1GB per backup. I thought it was strange but just assumed it was just another time machine bug that I’ve seen over the years. I restarted my machine but that didn’t fix it. So I’m currently restoring from yesterday’s time machine backup. The file transfer seems be very slow over cat5e 15 hours estimated for 250GB so that could indicate SSD problems?? Has anyone seen anything like this before? Is it a sign of a failing SSD? Any other ideas of what it might be? Scary stuff...
1,gotpmx,mac,4,2020/05/23 14:53:22,Afternoon,After looking at high end windows laptops for design it was clear MBPs aren't overpriced I am getting one. This is a hardcore windows guy who has a PC since 1997. I don't like MAC OS. Had use it at some classes at uni a decade ago. Anyway I am looking for a laptop that will last for 5 years is good for design. I am in Europe by the way. So I was looking online for prices of Lenovos Dells looking at 1TB SSD laptops good-ish gpu great screen top build quality BOOM!!! 2500EUR even 3500EUR I couldn't even find one 1TB SSD under 3000EUR. For a freaking Dell Lenovo? I was shocked. I remember it was always the MBP being at those price ranges. I am not going spend 3000EUR on a laptop that isn't made by Apple I really have get one. It makes 0 sense even despise MAC OS. I am making an investment it seems nowadays high end windows laptops are actually the worst kind of investment. I remember vividly 5-6 years ago there wasn't a single windows laptop that wasn't a better spec price than a MBP besides high end gaming laptops . I haven't payed much attention lately laptops I was so surprised. I even checked god knows how many reviews a 3500EUR XPS 15 had worse performance than a 2800EUR MBP when it comes video editing photo editing.

I flipped the laptop over immediately towelled off all the liquid I could. I’ve been keeping it open upside down over a towel. I’m not planning use it for 24 hours. The MBP still works I need use my laptop ASAP finish my essays for school. But I also don’t risk the laptop not suddenly working? Some of keyboard keys aren’t clicky they’re quite soft. What else can I do reduce the risk of it failing on me?

1,gossnl,mac,0,2020/05/23 14:00:34,Afternoon,Help purchasing a suitable monitor for a 2020 Macbook Pro Hi folks! I've been using a 2011 Macbook Pro for years but was just gifted a 2020 Macbook Pro for my birthday! I'm beyond excited start using it was looking purchase a monitor use alongside it. My big issue is cable management. As an amateur musician in a tiny apartment I'm already swamped /overwhelmed by all manner of cables however because I'm making a big upgrade from an old computer all of my accessories have traditional USB 3.0 cables I understand that might mean purchasing more cables/adapters. My friend suggested a hub connect my Mac... but even a hub I would still need a power source for the hub/monitocomputer I am running out of outlets in my room. From what I understand it would make sense for me get a monitor that connects via USB-C has USB 3.0 ports. It would eliminate the extra cables from a hub the need purchase a hub in the first place the cables from a laptop charger. I've seen some cheaper monitors that seem fit the bill but I believe a lot of them sacrifice resolution for price. I also heard from a friend that I might have trouble the speed of the USB ports I'm recording music through my audio interface/running a program like Logic Pro my computer is siphoning a lot of power from the monitor at the same time. Is this something that I should be worried about? I've been researching for the past few days but I know very little about computer hardware am overwhelmed by choice/computer jargon... so I've turned Reddit. Would love know what 've found works for . TL DR I'm looking for a new monitor for my 2020 Macbook Pro that connects via USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 that is powerful enough charge my computer while also allowing me utilize the USB 3.0 ports their fullest capacity that doesn't skimp too hard on image resolution. I also hate cables. Any recommendations? Thanks so much for your help!

It came back life after a charge but took a very long time boot up after recovering the first time. Now it boots up in about a minute or two. Since then the machine has been a little slow. Not tremendously but it's a bit sluggish it can't handle multiple tasks very easily. First question is what components might I have damaged having done this any? Second question is I was thinking of upgrading the RAM storage an SSD would it be worth it do that despite my blunder the laptop? It's in pretty great shape otherwise. Thank !

I'm a college student a month left in my remote learning just started having some laptop issues. I have a MacBook pro 2017 13in touchbar model. The screen is flashing pink blue horizontal lines on the top has some discolored/glitching pixels on the lefthand side I included a video for reference . Certain colors seem make the glitching worse. This started happening yesterday about halfway through the day. I didn't drop the laptop am almost certain there was no water damage. I really have no idea how this happened. I'm super reliant on my laptop right now both for school sanity . I'm also a film student am in the process of editing my thesis project so the glitchy display feels especially distracting. Has anyone encountered this problem before? Or any ideas about what's causing it? I definitely don't have the money for a new laptop right now so anyone has any suggestions about how repair this I'm willing try just about anything. Thanks in advance for all your help. 3 x200B

RAM memory overload I have a 2017 macbook pro 13 i always have issues it a while back all ports stopped working out of nowhere i tried everything get them working again i cleaned them multiple times but nothing seemed do any good. Eventually it ran out of battery i couldn't charge it so i just left it the side telling myself i was eventually going get it fixed. so one day as i was sitting bored on my bed i spot my macbook under a book decided try charge it. To my surprise i saw the apple logo pop up i was ecstatic. However since then i have continued having issues where it would over heat i have had it opened up the fans cleaned bu that didn't do any good. More recently i got clean my mac noticed that my RAM memory is always almost full i have no idea why i usually only have google chrome running my battery life is also really bad because of it i can get only 4 hours on one charge. I know it is nothing do the software because i factory reset it after it started charging again. So i was wondering there is something else going on anyone could give me tips or advice. Much appreciated. 
1,goq4y4,mac,12,2020/05/23 11:33:50,Morning,Help me choose Mac Mini 2020 vs Macbook Pro 16 vs Mac Pro 5 1 Pro video work  Hi all- I am currently a proud owner of a Mac Pro 5 1 mojave 8 core dual 2.4GHZ 40GB ram RX580 . I work professionally as a filmmaker video artist shoot 4k raw video 99% of the time a Blackmagic camera. Generally my workflow involves heavy color compositing work in Davinci editing in Premiere CC more compositing effects in Ae. That's about it for the work I do on the Mac Pro. At the moment this setup is perfect for my work I have yet see any slowdowns or issues the computer. The problem is as many of know this computer is about 10 years old now the processors board psu are all original. I am pondering an upgrade in the next year or so just get a jump on things as I know this machine won't last forever. I have done extensive research on the Mac Mini 2020 maxed out everything self upgrade max ram 1TB ssd the MBP 16 the maxed processor probably 1TB ssd 8GB graphics 64GB ram . For either of these options I would have pick up some sort of NAS or drive array work off of store videos. It also sounds like I need an eGPU for the Mini maybe for the MBP too. I work away from home 25% of the time pre-covid currently just have a shit experience using a 15 MBP from 2012. I really only do this I absolutely have but I do travel a lot so it would be nice have a more capable laptop- just not a necessity. Anyway this all comes down the question-- does anyone have experience a similar workflow using any of these new machines I mentioned? Would any of these machines be a downgrade from my current setup? Have previously transitioned from a cMP? Is there a better option I'm not considering? Of course the new Mac Pro is phenomenal correct me I'm wrong but I believe it would cost at least 8k get something up spec. As far as I can tell my other options would hit around 4-5k. I am not interested in building a hackintosh or transitioning a PC I have tried both in the past it's just not on the table this time around. Thank all in advance for the advice I so appreciate the help! x200B Geekbench for my Mac Pro 5 1 single core 2 202 multi-core 14 747 openCL 131 773

When I shut down start it on windows bootcamp suddenly the screen went off the green light of the camera turned on I was like who’s spying me so I immediately pressed hold the Touch ID/power button because nothing more seemed be working the light start blinking fading like it was a candle then went off. When I tried turn on again it didn’t work. I’ve done SMC NVRAM reset tried all the keyboard shortcuts start in different modes but nothing. Only the charging works because I hear the sound when connecting also it charges my iPad but as I mentioned in title the screen remains black the touchbar the keyboard backlight too. Anyone knows what could be the problem maybe a solution ? I’m from Peru in lockdown so repair centers are close. Sorry my English is bad non native speaker. Thank

I cannot find the hard drive anywhere. Also about a year ago my laptop started restarting at random every once in a while but functions properly 90% of the time. Should I tell them about this or will they do extensive testing on it when they receive it? I’m looking upgrade a 16” MacBook Pro this year. I am hoping get some cash back from my old laptop. Update I called one of the stores they said that they would still accept it. I think she also said they’ll do more evaluation when they get it they might adjust the quoted price.

1,gok2p6,mac,3,2020/05/23 06:12:27,Night,mac I need your help! I'm considering buying my first Mac wondering the MacBook Air 2020 is a worthy investment. I live in India I'm considering buying the MacBook Air 2020 model. Currently I'm using a Dell Inspiron Linux on it specifically elementary OS I hate Windows. This would be my first Mac experience so bear that in mind maybe. Needs My most important needs are Extensive browsing typing lots of quick photo editing I'm a writer Portability really good battery life I at least 9 hours which most laptops fail give Smart file manager like elementary OS - I my file manger have multiple tabs quick file previews some sort of memory feature where it can remember last open folders easy integration apps/actions e.g. right click on an image resize convert etc. .- Oh also can I connect my Android phone the Mac manage files easily? I know it sounds like a stupid question but I've heard people complain about this. Light video audio editing how is iMovie Garageband for people new video podcast creation? Can guys tell me how specifically does macOS meet these needs? Which model? The second thing I need help is choosing the right model the MacBook Air 2020 sells in India for i3 dual-core 256 GB storage for ₹93k. 1230 i5 quad-core 512 GB storage for ₹123k 1630 I'm hesitant get the i5 model because ₹100k is hitting my budget but every review I read suggests strongly going for the i5 model for much better performance. I intend use this laptop for at least 4 years not more so I have a feeling that while the i3 maybe fine for now it will show its age quickly in a couple of years. Do think I can do i3? What I don't ? I've looked into older MacBook Air models I don't risk the Butterfly keyboard just get a lower price. I've also looked into getting an iPad Pro a keyboard but have ruled it out for various reasons including like its mediocre file management. Dell XPS vs. MBA 2020 If the Mac doesn't meet my needs I may buy a Dell XPS Linux instead but from what I've heard I'm hoping that macOS will give me a productivity boost. Let me know thanks!

2,gof3xo,mac,26,2020/05/22 23:57:51,Evening,Should I make the switch Mac? Here’s some context. I’ve used Windows all my life but for a good chunk of the last decade I’ve been an iPhone user. I’ve cycled through several PCs Windows laptops but the compatibility overall ecosystem of macOS has been especially tempting in the recent years. I’m currently using a Lenovo ThinkPad L480 i5 processor 16 gigs of RAM an upgraded 1TB SSD after some tinkering . It’s a decent laptop but the build quality doesn’t echo the original ThinkPads I can see myself buying a new laptop sometime next year. Recent Windows updates have made me further consider jumping ship. Question is would switching a Mac be worth it by next year? Besides compatibility general UI features I know the pros cons of using a Mac hardware software . Factors consider would be price storage ideally 1TB 512GB would be pushing it processor hardware considerations definitely avoid the butterfly keyboard . I’m not too heavy a user—at the most I have Photoshop Illustrator or Audition running. Feedback thoughts would be appreciated. Edit Forgot mention that I’m currently looking at laptops only portability is a must for me.

I have a broken MBP 2015 which the costs of repair are considerably higher than getting a new one so I thought this would be a good opportunity jump the next generation. I have already considered the USB-C other feature-related issues but I'm worried about manufacturing issues. I was about buy a 2016 13 without touchbar in perfect state new keyboard battery replaced by Apple but then pulled out because of worries about flexgate/stagelight keyboard issues. Searching online it seemed me that have a 2016-2017 're condemned at least get flexgate at some point but is it that widespread? That's the only thing preventing me from upgrading not I'll have settle for a 2014 model because I'm having a hard time finding any reasonably priced 2015 here. I really get a newer one but also don't wake up one day find the screen dead all of a sudden. Thank !

4,gobaov,mac,9,2020/05/22 19:02:12,Evening,Performance of macbook air 2020 was not what I expected should I exchange it for another laptop? Hi! I recently bought the Macbook Air 2020 intel core 5 w/ 256 GB . I bought it because I'm going grad school soon I heard it was a good laptop for those who just use their computers for everyday tasks nothing too crazy in terms of processing . Within a week of use I noticed the fan is incredibly loud my laptop heats up all the time. This is a daily thing the only thing I use is google chrome. I know I should switch safari but its ridiculous that my laptop will heat up the fan goes off even one tab open playing tetris or I join a google hangout. Another issue I have this laptop is the rainbow wheel of death that appears when i click on certain apps like facetime photos. I find it strange that it takes a long time open apple's own apps. Lastly the battery life kinda sucks? I find myself having recharge my laptop at least once a day I literally just got this a week ago. I've never had these issue my early 2015 macbook. I would have continued use it it didn't become so slow. I contacted apple they suggested i send it the apple care team so they can see there's a manufacturing issue but I also wanted reddit's advice see this is a common occurrence. If it is I'm debating what laptop I should get instead.

1,goasfb,mac,1,2020/05/22 18:27:45,Afternoon,Can I split an external hard drive in two use one half for my Mac OS the other for my Bootcamp Windows? So I bootcamped my mac get Windows on there for a little gaming. Everything is perfect there but I only used 200 gigs wanted save a lot of room for music production on the mac side. Basically after only installing three games I'm at the windows limit. Been looking at hard drives it is certainly more efficient for me get one 4TB than 2 2TB. Is it doable partition an external drive into these two different formats have a 4TB where 2 TB of space is recognized each in Mac OS Windows? Or would I be better off getting the two separate drives formatting them separately? Thanks

1,goa6em,mac,4,2020/05/22 17:47:08,Afternoon,Resetting a LOT of T2-Equipped Macs AppleEnterprise is a bit dead else I would ask there. MDM Mobile Device Management software used set policies for student devices that needs be installed as a part of setting up the device for the first time configure the devices correctly. x200B I find myself needing do a full reinstall of MacOS on 300 yes three hundred new MacBook Air 2019s. I work for a school I'm setting up devices are for students next autumn. There is a bug in Setup Assistant MDM enrollment on the version of MacOS the devices shipped . I don't post too many details publicly out of respect for the my employer the MDM provider who has been lovely throughout this whole process... Long story short devices fail enroll the only known solution confirmed by the MDM provider who is actively working on this Apple is a full OS reinstall. OS reinstall time I boot into recovery mode into Disk Utility wipe the disk create a new partition then go into Install MacOS agree the terms choose the partition wait. Recovery attempts download MacOS. Recovery fails after 20-40 minutes about 75% of the time across every single device PKDownloader Error 8. So I made a few Catalina install USBs take the network out of the equation. These Macs have the T2 chip so they won't boot from USB by default. I reboot into recovery open Startup Security Utility. It needs an admin authenticate. This is a new device straight out of the box there are no admins. Startup Security Utility refuses launch. On a new machine one where I haven't wiped the disk I boot up the device fails enroll in MDM but lets me continue as it is a consumer device I go through setup create a temporary admin account reboot into recovery enable boot from USB authenticating my new temp account reboot into the USB connect the internet update something or other since this is a newer version of MacOS than the device has seen before reboot into the USB but for real this time wipe drives install MacOS everything goes swimmingly from there. This process works but takes FOREVER sometimes steps fail along the way need be restarted. Everything is fine the MDM software after I reinstall but the reinstall itself is an absolute pain in the neck. Tl dr what is the fastest least painful way reinstall MacOS on 300 new-in-the-box T2-equipped devices?

I opted for an older model a disk drive so I could play DVDs in it. Lately it’s been crashing every so often. Once it froze had be rebooted from a Zoom meeting took forever reload. That was maybe a month back. Same when I was writing a paper on Microsoft Word about a week ago. It shut down took like 35 minutes get back up normal speed once reopened. Last night when trying save an article I had on a website as a PDF. Froze. Crashed rebooted itself. Super slow get back up speed. Is there something I should be doing? It’s been buggy extra slow since updating MacOS Catalina about three-four months ago but nothing like this. It runs normally a lot of the time but just this past week it’s crashed twice in the middle of totally normal tasks. Does it need be powered down more often? Maybe a program needs be deleted? I downloaded creative cloud but it runs super slow anyways my trial is up so maybe delete that?

Say 're recording a video for Youtube but don't the viewers see your cluttered desktop. There's a solution for that! All have do is quit finder.

I'm 99% of the time a PC guy but I have an old macbook my girlfriend uses from time time. Today I received an email/call from my ISP saying that a device in my house connected my network had some kind of security issue. I found this pretty hard believe as I'm pretty secure when it comes all my online devices. It's also not a scam. My ISP confirmed it but they were pretty limited in giving me details. They provided me an IP address which none of the devices in my house correspond as well as some host information which was bgtc.mac-autofixer.com Upon reading up online I found that Mac autofixer is some kind of malicious software that tries scam etc. Easy enough fix except that when i search through the applications folder on the macbook I have no evidence that mac auto fixer is even installed. I figured I could install some kind of Mac anti malware program but I am met the issue that this Macbook OS is too old install software of any kind. I'm just feeling kind of lost here my ISP says they will suspend my service I don't resolve this issue. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks!

Since I'm new the apple world would the two be equals in terms of performance or am I missing something that the pro is offering ? I would mainly use it for programming so intellij vscode chrome docker etc... Is there really a difference between those two or should I go the pro get better performance ? x200B EDIT thanks everyone. I decided go the pro.

2,gnwp2f,mac,5,2020/05/22 05:18:35,Night,Does anyone else have a 13” MacBook Pro 2020 Headphone jack popping issue? I've had my new 13” MacBook Pro 2020 base model 16GB for about a week I've loved it so far however I've realised that there is an issue when listening audio through headphones. Whenever the audio stops starts or is scrubbed through there is an audible clicking or popping that sounds a bit like when plug headphones into an audio jack. I'm not getting the same noise through the speakers as far as I can tell when I listen via a 3.5mm USB-C adapter it is absent on the headphones too. So it seems restricted the headphone port I've tried different headphones too the same problem persists . Is anyone else experiencing this? Is this something that could be fixed in a software update? I really don't have return it... --------- Upon a bit more experimentation it appears be a power management issue. If any other audio is playing even when the volume is at zero then the popping does not occur. So it appears OSX is turning the audio jack on off as soon as audio starts stops causing the popping. So a quick fix is have an ambient audio source playing the volume at zero. I'm personally using Noizio off the App Store as it sits unobtrusively in the menu bar but I'm pretty sure anything would work. I really hope apple fix this as it has taken the edge off of an otherwise fantastic product... Apparently there is a similar issue Realtek HD Audio drivers on Dell PCs too although there have wait 10-20 seconds before the jack will shut off . They recommend replacing the drivers but obviously it's not quite as easy replace core audio on a Mac!

So I backed up my computer 3 days ago on time machine when I had High Sierra then proceeded upgrade Catalina. For whatever reason the system does not run well on my mac i'd like revert my computer back however when trying use time machine I get this message 'The system cannot be restored onto this disk because HFS systems can't be restored space sharing APFS volumes. Reinstall MacOS on this disk then use Migration Assistant transfer data from your backup assistant.' I was advised try in internet recovery mode but when trying select my computers drive I am forever stuck on 'searching for disks...' so this isn't an option either it seems. So I'm thinking that I factory reset my computer I can then use my time machine bring it back how it was pre Catalina. Does this sound right? I just double check before I wipe my computer theres a possibility time machine won't work I figure the message about the system being unable be restored is because of Catalina but a factory reset should get rid of Catalina right? Any help would be appreciated as I need my laptop working asap its driving me a bit mad now thanks!

However I press firmly in the 4 corners the mac gets stable again. Then it wobbles randomly pick it up transport it. I have a MacBook air by its side test it does't wobble at all. It looks like the chassis itsbielf is maybe too big deforms a little bit ? It doesn't wobble on all surfaces though. Is that something guys experienced before ? Worth sending it back ?

1,gnvp26,mac,9,2020/05/22 04:09:52,Night,PCI GPU's built-in Mac support? I have a MacPro 5 1 it's OEM nVidia card a second old but highish end AMD card. But that card R9 270 i think is windows only so I basically never use it since this mac pro is booted into MacOS 99% of the time. I was looking at what PCI options there are what I hear suggested is that there are a whole array of AMD PCI cards that now have supported built in from the OS. You don't even need Mac versions?! Is this true? If so is there a list somewhere? And details of what is supported what is it? I think I read that the unflashed card would have no pre-boot video. But that's fine since I'd be keeping the original nvidia card. My Mac Pro is currently on High Sierra it probably will be for some time come. I might upgrade it Mojave at some point. High Sierra support is the most important thing at this point. Ideally I'd like a pretty powerful card for no more than 150. Which leads me the next question. Assume I get a list of supported cards how do actually compare their performance know which ones have good computing bang for the buck which do not? Trying compare GPU performance is like trying compare cable bills. It's all just a random jumble of market speak that purposefully can't make any sense of.

MacBook Pro 16” 2019 base model 2.6GHz i7 16GB DDR4 512GB SSD Pros can run all sorts of apps concurrently no slowdown screen size is real nice Cons the battery life has been awful so far I’m 10 cycles in can see it draining at least 1% every minute the trackpad is comically large I’m always hitting it by accident it’s unwieldy carrying it from room room is a hassle I can’t see over the screen when I’m on my couch first world problems 2 . MacBook Air 2020 base model 1.1GHz i3 8GB LPDDR4X 256GB SSD Pros easy move around the house throw in a bag battery life is much better than the Pro I have a bunch of chargers that will support it Cons workflow has be modified accommodate the reduced horsepower smaller screen obviously This is where I need your expert advice collective experience. I think the new MBA is the way go but an upgraded i5 CPU this is a 100 investment that should yield the best bang for the buck. I don’t need the 512GB SSD so I’m hesitant get the higher end model but I was wondering it’s worth springing for the 200 RAM upgrade 16GB? This would be way more useful than the disk space IMO. The programs I usually have running are Safari Chrome VPN Client VSCode iTerm 2 Messages Discord MS Teams MS Remote Desktop With the exception of Chrome none of these is too taxing. I just hear from folks who have had experience a similar setup workflow. Edit Wow I seem have incensed some 16 loyalists. I'm not trying pick a fight anyone so try not infer anything negative from my tone I'm pretty loyal Apple but there have been some severe missteps in many of their recent product lines. I still don't understand the need for the Touch Bar. Having said that I also have some 10 years or so as a professional Mac user supporter. I've held ACSA ACMT ACTH certifications understand how power consumption dGPUs work. Palm detection leaves a lot be desired as it will inherently impede trackpad functionality even when not intended as supported anecdotally from several users I've interacted . Regarding screen size that was mostly tongue-in-cheek obviously a 16 is going be quite different than a 13 .

3,gnlk8e,mac,0,2020/05/21 15:28:05,Afternoon,Simple external bootable tool kit saved me from a failed boot drive this week If use a Mac long enough will run into a failed drive corrupt OS or other weird boot failures. If use BootCamp or different boot drives the chance for issues goes way up. This little tip has saved my butt many many times in the 13 years Ive been using OS X / MacOS. I picked this up when I worked for Apple back in the early 2000s have kept one on hand ever since. I buy a small 60-120GB external SSD or USB drive partition it into two. On one partition I install a bootable version of whichever MacOS version my main system is running. This will allow me boot into the external drive assess the internal drive that may have failed troubleshoot the system. On the second partition I create a bootable MacOS installer that allows me reinstall MacOS in the event the internal recovery partition is corrupt. Apple Support article on creating external MacOS installer This practice saved me again this week when I had an old SSD boot drive go belly-up. I was able use my external tool kit troubleshoot the installer format install MacOS on the replacement boot drive much quicker than internet recovery mode. Restored from my Time Machine Backup was up in running in under 2 hours. If are far from an Apple Store rely heavily on your Mac it might be worth the small amount of time money make an bootable external drive help cut your downtime. Another great practice is keep a bootable clone of your main drive using a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner x200B Just my ramblings hope it saves someone some headaches in the future.

I'm trying decide between the Air the 13' Pro although I'm leaning towards the former as I value portability have been told the Touch Bar is a hassle. The only concern I have is about its performance which should be enough for me as I don't do anything particularly processor intensive day--day. I tend have pretty intensive internet browsing sessions regularly though which imply having 100 tabs open at the same time. Should the Air handle this? If so would I need gun for a processoRAM upgrade? Thanks guys

I expected pay around 2500 for the rumored 32inch 6K display. When it finally came out bam 5000 so i canned that idea. Now I have an opportunity buy an XDR for about 30% off which drops the price around 3500. I can also sell my LG 5k for about 800 which brings my cost down being around what I was originally thinking of spending on an Apple Monitor. My use case is mostly software/hardware development but I also am a hobbiest photographer do a little bit of video work. I have an OLED TV I would love have that kind of contrast on a computer monitor. What would do could get an XDR for 3500?

Specs could be 17 3840x2400 mini-LED screen Weighs 5-5.1lbs less than a non-retina 15 MBP Edge--edge screen so might be slightly thicker than current MBP 16 120Wh battery User-upgradable RAM SSD Might need special charge port for power delivery hopefully MagSafe or similar 4 TB3 SD slot A base model for 3 000 could come 8-core i7 1TB SSD 32GB RAM Some Vega GPU A top-end model could come 12-core Xeon 128GB RAM 8TB SSD Probably a Vega 56 The biggest question is there a market for a laptop like this? 5lbs Xeon Mac OS seem like a killer machine me.

For example I would open up eBay it would open a new tab for a sketchy cigar website. I’ve had these ad pop ups in new tabs the last few days. I’ve tried deleting files I thought was causing the issue but it’s not going away. I’ve cleared reset my browsers as well. I believe I have this issue from downloading a flash player for a game play a few days ago. Do I need download a malware remover fix this? I’m running out of options on what do. Help would be greatly appreciated.

I've got a very strange issue which many days trawling Google just hasn't been able solve. I have a Rode Videomicro an SC7 cable TRS - TRRS which I use my iPhone record audio outside. It works well I've had no issues it in this regard. However when I plug it into a 15 2017 MBP through the 3.5mm port it doesn't show up in the sound preferences panel use as an external microphone. I tried on my girlfriend's 15 2018 MBP - which I assume uses exactly the same sound system - it popped up straight away works like a charm. Oddly my pair of Bose QC25's shows up as a valid external microphone just fine when plugged in the cable. My question is... what gives? Does the 2017 MBP actually have a slightly different microphone input which doesn't like higher impedance microphones for some reason? And so... how can I get this darn microphone show up on my laptop without buying an audio interface... I've tried rebooting many times. I've tried using a different cable. I've tried blowing into the microphone try get OSX see it. No dice.

Since I work from home now I mostly use a remote desktop Zoom Apple Music while sometimes connected a 4K monitor. So far it has worked flawlessly. I can use the laptop write code locally or connect web IDEs like Cloud9. It’s better than the iPad Pro w/ Magic keyboard combo. I can install anything on my MacBook rather than be limited by iOS. I am stunned by how effective this setup is. My hope is Apple revives this form factor an Arm chip. I was seriously thinking of getting a new 13” or 16” Mac but I think my days of buying powerful laptops is over. I still hate the butterfly keyboard.

However I'm undecided not sufficiently knowledgeable decide which model or specifications I should buy/add. The entry level comes these specs Has 1 fan x200B Entry Model While the updated model has these Has 2 fans x200B Intermediate Model This is my first time ever going into MacOS. I've always used Windows but lately my friends coworkers have changed my perspective on Macbooks. The intermediate value is 500 bucks more expensive than the entry model although I do have the money purchase it i'd like the best cost-benefit choice. The things i'll be most likely use the macbook for are code in Android Studio try out Xcode mostly mobile development. If the entry model is more than enough handle mobile development should I add some upgrades or do recommend otherwise. Note that I'd like this macbook last for as long as possible so the intermediate model can outlast the entry one by a lot i'd say that's a lot of value in those extra bucks. x200B Will be much appreciated for some constructive opinions thank in advance From a fellow soon be mac user.

So far I've tried un-pairing re-pairing the mouse my iMac reinstalling the logi options software but none of these seem work.

UPDATE After fussing around my privacy security settings I ended up deleting both Logi options Logi options daemon from the input monitoring accessibility panes relaunched the app. It asked for my permission again all is now working as expected. I guess 'turn it off on again' is sometimes the answer.

Ok so let's preface this a little bit of info I am currently using a 2019 13 MacBook Pro running Catalina 10.15.4. According what both the menu bar the settings window show I am connected my network the network my apartment complex provides . My device is registered the ISP via the MAC address the status on their website says that my computer is connected. However I am unable connect the internet despite this. This has been the situation for several hours now. At first I assumed there must be some sort of maintenance happening but my roommates have all had connection throughout the day. I am posting this from my desktop which has also maintained connection. It seems just be my MacBook. On top of that the connectivity issues only started around noon. I'm not sure this is relevant or not but I thought it was weird that it happened so I might as well mention it see it means anything. Earlier today around the same time the internet stopped working my trackpad also stopped working properly. It would register clicks but it would not move the cursor. Shortly after a bluetooth window would open up asking about registering a keyboard but not finding one. The window eventually closed that's when I would regain control of my cursor. This has happened a total of 3 times since the internet went out. I ran a diagnostic on my Wi-Fi environment as recommended by the apple support site but the only result was check the DNS Resolution. Is my issue a virus? Is it a hardware issue? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

So I use a lot of space on my windows partition 50/50 split from windows Mac mostly because of games. I need add more space my windows partition using a program that I use frequently but I’m a bit worried on adding more space the windows partition since I need lose space from the Mac partition which is my main OS the free space for my Mac partition is getting slim around 15gb free only This is why I might either install or transfer my windows installation into a usb flash drive delete windows from my system instead use windows by running it using a flash drive by plugging it into my Mac effectively ADDING space for the windows OS instead of parting it the space already implemented the Mac. Would this be possible installing windows into a flash drive keeping ALL windows files inside it so that windows just runs on the flash drive do not need download the files into my system every time I use it? Also this is possible would the speed of programs such as video games slow down or lag due it being on a flash drive instead of being downloaded into my Mac? It’ll be appreciated could provide me some information about this. Thanks!

However I still feel like my 2010 is more of a workhorse than this newer MacBook. I’m thinking of trying buy an older MBP more screen real estate horsepower get rid of the butterfly keyboard so in this subs opinion what’s the best bang for the buck? What MBP spec’d accordingly do think still holds its own? Not trying throw down a couple grand for a brand new MBP. I’ve seen some threads on this sub where people said their 2013 Retina MBP is still a beast an SSD thrown in. Also heard people say the 2015 is still as good as anything on the market today so... thoughts?

3,gmpw0b,mac,1,2020/05/20 06:43:57,Night,8th gen 1.4 i5 Macbook vs 8th gen 3.6 quad core 4k iMac I tried find an answer online I think I found it but I'm not sure I'm understanding it. So I'm in the market for either a MacBook Pro or 4k iMac. The base13 inch MacBook Pro has a 1.4 quad core 8th gen i5 turbo boosts up 3.9. The base 4k iMac has a 3.6 quad core 8th gen i3. This is where I get lost. So after some time on google it looks like the difference between the i3 i5 is that an i5 or up will have turbo boost while the i3 doesn't. Therefore the i3 will have a higher clock speed because it doesn't have the variance that the i5 has. From a numbers perspective the i5 is faster when it does hit that 3.9 turbo boost. Now my question is there going be a noticeable difference in overall computer performance or are these more similar than different? Just for background so I'm currently a PhD student some hobbies. That makes my computer usage mostly typing papers running some stats basic SEM usually using SPSS /or Mplus. I don't plan on doing hardcore SEM on this computer. Moreso I'd let it run a model overnight need be some light video/audio editing using Adobe Premiere .

My neighbor has a MacBook Air that she was having problems so I offered take a look at it get it upgraded the latest OS. The only files she needed off the Mac were her photos which were saved in the Photos app. In total she had about 7 500 photos in the photos app. I exported the pictures from the photos app a USB drive. I wiped the hard drive reinstalled the OS then upgraded the OS. Originally I did not realize that she was using the iCloud store all her pictures. Through a combination of errors on my part trying import the photos I exported etc. I am now seeing over 17 000 pictures in the iCloud. I am assuming that many of the images got duplicated at least once when I was trying import the photos that I exported. What is the best way go about cleaning up all of the duplicates? Doing this 100% manually is really not an option. I am tempted download all the images an external drive then deleting everything from iCloud. I'd then hook that external drive up my Windows machine running the pictures through an application detect remove all the duplicates. Once all duplicates have been removed I'll then import them back into the Photos app let it syn iCloud. What are your thoughts?

However going forward I’m going start working in photoshop pretty heavily using large photographs as well as a tablet stylus for hand drawing etc for coming up promotional materials as well as possibly some video editing stuff for YouTube I’d imagine sound editing podcasts . With that in mind I’m looking get an iMac which I think would be the best choice given my budget iMac Pros above are a little out of my price range likely overpowered for what I need anyway . I think the 27 inch is the sensible option but know some upgrades the base model will be needed/sensible. I know RAM is important but have heard can upgrade this much cheaper on your own looking around I can see that I could do it for about 350 I’m in the U.K. for 64GB as opposed 1000 through Apple’s website. Seems like a no brained order the base spec in this regard then upgrade the RAM myself. But form there what are the most important elements? Graphics card SSD processor? Or all three? Ideally I’d like keep the budget 3000 - 3500 the extra RAM follow later. So what area should I concentrate on? Feeing a little lost it all. Also considering the outlay I make sure I’m future proofed as much as feasibly so the machines lasts as long as possible. And not looking game on it so that isn’t a factor.

1,gmm1x1,mac,2,2020/05/20 02:33:45,Night,2016 MBP Screen Issues turning into something much worse...HEP! So a little while ago I was a little hasty in closing up my MBP I pulled out the headphone cable shut my screen not realising that my headphone jack had moved between the screen keyboard. when I shut the lid I heard a crunch sound opened up the lid as saw a crack down the right hand side of the screen along the bottom. I had only lost about 15mm along the bottom right hand side so I plugged it into a second monitor continued use it. Then whilst using it one day the main screen just died so only the external display plugged in worked. I tried find out how much it would cost repair but they all said I'd be better off buying a new computer. No worries I just have a desktop now instead of a laptop I'm not going anywhere in lockdown so I'm ok that right now. Then somehow overnight the power cable came unplugged I came down in the morning an unresponsive laptop. I plugged in the cable back in no sound like usual when it connects. I left it charging for a bit the tried start it up. I can see that the screen is backlit but now nothing shows up on the second monitor the instructions use the fingerprint log in don't show up either just an escape button. x200B I've tried resetting the NVRAM the SMC but I'm not sure I'm doing anything as I can't see the screen I'm not getting any different results. I also tried starting it in safe mode see it would get the second monitor working so I could at least get my data off but no luck. Does anyone have an suggestions on how I might be able get it working again? Or do I just have a nice expensive brick now? Any help is very much appreciated!!

1,gmiub8,mac,2,2020/05/19 22:00:04,Evening,Retina MacBook Pro vs Mac Pro Need help on upgrading from 2012 rMBP Hello all I am currently in the market upgrade my 2.6ghz 16gb i7 2012 rMBP. I use my Mac for video processing converting editing. Nothing too crazy but high quality 1080p video trimming light editing as well as some 4k exporting. My current rMBP is pretty excellent still runs rather fast but it seems that the 650M are no longer fitting my needs it lacks TB2 not a dealbreaker but would be nice the 512 ssd is not enough for me. I see myself 3 options stick this computer upgrade the ssd upgrade a newer rMBP or look at a desktop. I believe I would benefit most from an upgrade another machine since the 2012 ssd are a little pricey. I am looking at the mid 2015 rMBP 2.8ghz 16gb ram 2tb ssd M370x or a 2012 Mac Pro 3.46ghz x5690 23/32gb ram 500gb ssd 2 2tb hdd 8gb radeon rx 580 gpu. I have found both for about the same price. Im wondering what would be the best option for me? Apple dropped support for the Mac Pro so it won't be seeing Catalina or other future OSs but I feel as the 2015 rMBP is on its way out soon as well. What I'm asking is how much improvement will I see going the MacBook vs Mac Pro. The MBP has usb 3 bigger ssd than I currently have tb2 force touch dedicated gpu a bump in processor speed from my current model. The Mac Pro has a bunch of options for storage up 6 drives that I can raid probably be faster than the MBP 8gb graphics 12 cores 3.46ghz 24 or 32gb of ram depending on what I would decide on. Will the processor bump dedicated gpu of the 2015 rMBP see much improvement over my current 2012 rMBP is it even worth it ? Will the Mac Pros older but faster desktop hardware be better than this? What would be the best machine as in the fastest most powerful? What would recommend either for me or had choose? I currently use my rMBP docked my Thunderbolt Display another monitor about 50% of the time. The mobility of this set up is nice I'm thinking I can keep my laptop add a desktop into the mix that would be the best route not I would go the newer laptop use my old one as a desktop always plugged into the TB display.

1,gm6ouc,mac,6,2020/05/19 10:07:02,Morning,2020 13” MacBook Pro vs. 2017 15” MacBook Pro So I have a mid-2017 MacBook Pro 13 inch entry level 2 port no touchbar 128gb storage 8gb ram I’m going sell it my sister for 700. Because of this I’m now in the market for another MacBook Pro. Since I’m a university student I’m looking at the new 2020 13 inch MBP the student discount. For 500 out of pocket 1 200 total I’d be getting 256 GB storage the new keyboard tech as well as the touchbar Touch ID. Beyond that the update is not that big. However I’ve found a secondhand mid-2017 15 inch MacBook Pro for 1 200 that is in amazing condition. This is substantial compared the 13 inch in the sense that it will have a better processor higher RAM along the 256gb storage the obvious size/dedicated graphics update. As aforementioned I am a student primarily use my computer for my work word PowerPoint excel SPSS but I also stream sports/entertainment heavily use photoshop for designing. Because of this I have a tendency multitask. I’m neurotic about keeping my computer clean so I’ve never had an issue the butterfly keyboard that many people have experienced I’ve had my 2017 since 2018. I would like an updated keyboard but I care for my tech enough have not had any issues after 2 years my 2017. Essentially I’m torn between getting a new 13 inch or a secondhand 15 inch. I was hoping for some input on what guys would do in this situation. Although I love the larger 15 inch model it’s a more substantial update I do value having something more “current” especially straight out of the box. Let me know what guys think in the comments thanks - 
1,gm6m3g,mac,2,2020/05/19 10:03:21,Morning,Base model of the 2020 MacBook Pro 13 worth it? Now this has been a though decision. I have been looking at laptops non-stop for the past weeks because I'm in need of a new laptop. I was initially going get a Windows but have now decided get my first Mac. I'm indecisive between the 2020 MacBook Air the mentioned MacBook Pro. The reason why I lean more towards the Pro is because of the issue heat on the Air even though it has the newer 10th gen i5 DDR4 how the Pro has more power. With the Pro I would be able get the base model the older CPU RAM make me uncertain on how long the laptop would last before it becomes slower etc. Any times would be useful.

1,gm662u,mac,8,2020/05/19 09:41:36,Morning,What is happening my MacBook? I have a 13” 2015 MacBook Pro that had been working flawlessly until one week before quarantine now two months . When I turn it on trackpad doesn’t move the pointer but it does give that haptic feedback deep pressure the key oars won’t work except for the turn/off key all its related combinations. Overtime I found out that I press harder on the trackpad at the bottom part of the Mac but at the same “location” as the trackpad the pointer eventually starts move keyboard works normally. However when this happens also the following fails haptic feedback stops working for some reason If I caps lock the grin light indicating it’s on doesn’t always light on always causes the Mac freeze for about 3 or 4 seconds when I turn it off the freezing doesn’t happen. Because of quarantine I haven’t had the chance fix it have been doing the pressing thing but sometimes it just doesn’t work makes me very frustrated. If I use a Bluetooth mouse keyboard both work but the Mac’s won’t. Any idea of what is happening I can fix it myself?

1,gm3spb,mac,1,2020/05/19 07:41:05,Morning,Thinking about switching PC Macbook - a few processor questions Hi all My current laptop 2015 HP Spectre is slowly dying I'm thinking of replacing it a Macbook Air or Pro but I'm a little confused the processors. I'm not sure I should get the 2020 Air or 2020 Pro. What is the difference between the i5 in the Air the i5 in the Pro? Does jumping from 8th-gen Intel 10th-gen make a big difference? The most intense thing I'll be doing is probably oldeless intense games like CSGO gmod Stardew. I currently have a dual-core 6th-gen i7 2.6ghz. The processors on Macs seem have much lower ghz values- will I notice slower performance because of this or are Macs just more efficient at using processor speed? Thanks for your help!

I have really enjoyed working the iMac but I miss the portability. I use it for photography school work primarily. I called Apple hypothetically talk about trading it in for some credit purchasing a maxed RAM 16in MacBook Pro. I guess they see there is nothing for the computer be traded up since it is the latest iMac. I thought about third-party selling but I am looking for some advice. Is the 16in MacBook the i7 that good? Have some of guys enjoyed laptop experience external monitors?

The graphics card is a NVIDIA Geforce 8800 GT 512 MB. I have an crappy old Screen attached today I tried attach my Samsung 4K TV. It works when switching it from standard 1080p which would be totally fine for me. The problem appears when I detach the crappy screen so I would just stay on the TV. MacOS immediately switches the resolution something else the Screen turns black. TV shows resolution not supported . This drives me crazy because it works when I attach the crappy old on again then also the TV shows up again on 1080p. Is there any known solution for this? I already tried resetting PRAM SMC reset I am close a blank reinstall but I guess this wont solve my problem. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance Chris

I have several questions While having fun the different configurations on the apple site I notice that I can have macs better specification for less I take a Macbook Air. What are the differences ? Is it safer take in my budget a slightly less powerful macbook pro or a macbook air? In terms of use it is especially for office use Excel web browsing. However I'm still looking for a model that can last a few years. x200B thanks in advance

1,glyntg,mac,1,2020/05/19 02:00:36,Night,Macbook Air vs Macbook Pro 13 when considering quad core 16GB ram? I'm considering buying a laptop at least quad-core 16GB ram. I'll do python research small machine learning stuff my laptop. Specifically I'm working in the field of Natural Language Processing. Considering the price the base version of MacBook air configured quad-core 16GB ram is the best for me. I don't care about the size of SSD 256GB is enough for me . However I'm worried about throttling will occur on the Macbook Air. When I go for the MacBook Pro 13 I'll select the option 2.0 quad-core 16GB 512GB SSD but it costs 1799 dollars additional tax which I think is out of my budget. I know the base model of the Macbook Pro has quad cores but that processor is not the newest one which makes me hesitated buy it. x200B I hear opinions when think about it from my perspective.

Setup Monitor LG 24MP88HV-S Mac 2017 MacBook Pro 128GB no touchbar Dongle NOVOO Hub USB C Multiport 5 in 1 Story I have a MacBook Pro 2017 base model I always used it without a problem until 1 month ago I after updating macOS Catalina 10.15.4 all the streaming services stopped working an error shows up in each one of them saying is something about HDCP. I contacted the chat support for all the streaming services I use they all responded the same they have no responsibility as they only guarantee the service work on internal screens of devices so only on native displays. If use an external monitor or anything else watch they have 0 responsibility as the external device can become unsupported for piracy checks as HDCP . Even watching the content on my internal Mac display wouldn't work the only solution this was watching on the Mac display while disconnecting everything else. Here I thought the problem was my monitor as the dongle alone didn't give me problems. Solution Long story short it was Safari... Call me dumb for not thinking about the browser before doing all of that but how? And why the browser should be a problem only on the monitor not on the Mac itself? Now everything is working Firefox. x200B Hope this will help someone some of know anything about this I'm interested!
3,glqhs1,mac,2,2020/05/18 16:01:34,Afternoon,Retiring 2013 15 inch Macbook Pro for new 16 inch Macbook Pro Hi I'm about graduate thanks covid head off into higher education. I've saved my parents a lot of money through scholarships so I am trying decide on an upgrade. I have had the same mac since 2013 I've pretty much used it bits. It's slow I can't really do any sort of gaming anymore on it I'm just counting down the days until it explodes or something. It's recommending that I replace the battery asap. I can no longer run Final Cut Pro because every time I try the program crashes. I also edit photos using Aperture regularly but cannot export anything anymore. I figured that the new 16 inch base model would be best last me the next decade or so. I whichever option will last me longer before dying will be faster in running programs like Aperture Final Cut Pro will have a longer lasting battery. So - should I upgrade from 16 GB 32 GB of RAM leave everything else the same or should I upgrade my processor instead leave everything else the same? I understand I will receive a student discount - does anyone know anything about this? According Apple's site I can't trade in my 2013 mac for money but I can recycle it. What should I do my beat up 2013? I figure it will last another half year before it breaks down. Has anyone made an big jump in mac versions like this before that can talk about how much different it is? Everything in my 2013 mac is all the base version without upgrades.

1,gluke1,mac,6,2020/05/18 20:29:14,Evening,Does shutting down or force quitting when a program stops responding count as a ‘crash’? I am working in Microsoft Word the program has stopped responding. I learnt there’s an autosave function that starts once first save then refreshes every 10 minutes. I feel very stupid for having not done this because I’ve been working on the document for awhile however this has never happened before so I felt safe. I read that Word has an auto recovery function however for when the application closes unexpectedly or due a crash. However I know this is deleted manually select ‘don’t save when close’. So my question is since it is not responding I cannot close it I have two options. To force quit restart my computer. If I force quit word does it consider me closing it ‘don’t save’? On the other hand I restart my computer while it’s not responding would this be considered a ‘crash’? When I go back on Word would I be able access the recovery files? Any help/ suggestions are incredibly helpful.

In short I have a new me macbook pro 13 wanted format start fresh on the machine. I moved forward the catalina download 10.12 was installed by the original owner built the install media. I rebooted into recovery cleaned the disk selected install MacOS from my installation drive. I didn't take a clone or time machine before doing this because I figured there was nothing save. Well the install launches gets going for about 30 seconds reboots gives progress for about 3 minutes then dies saying An error occurred while loading the installer resources. I didnt have any failures or error messages when I created the boot media so I dont think I screwed that up - but hey it's anyone's guess here. Any hints? Thanks a ton

I'm currently on a base model 13 retina from early 2015 looking make an upgrade the new 13 4-port version. Currently I'm thinking of keeping the base CPU upgrading 32 GB ram upping 1TB storage. I was initially thinking of going just 16 GB but I'm planning on running Parallels VM for windows gaming I know bootcamp is a thing but my strong preference here is not have dual boot also hooking up an eGPU down the line. I also do quite a bit of development via Xcode requiring running iOS simulators as well. Ideally I'm also looking keep this new machine for at least another 5 years or so by which point perhaps the ARM support will be pretty good. Also we anticipate a newebetter redesign coming in the near future 6 months or so I think I can probably hold out. Thanks in advance!

Recently I upgraded a SSD which brought it back life I am currently waiting on 16 gigs of RAM that I ordered arrive. The weakest part of my MacBook is the battery it's status is Replace Soon has over 1900 cycles on the battery. I can get about 2ish hours of internet browsing before I need charge it. Personally I am trying get another 2ish years out of this MPB before I upgrade again the most intense thing I do is record basic demos on Logic . I looked up battery costs online they are running around 90. I'm trying keep the cost down as it is an older machine. Could not replacing the battery cause other damage my computer? If it does I may bite the bullet get a new one. I always use my MPB plug it only unplug it I'm not using it. I also never really take it anywhere it just sits on my desk. I appreciate any replies!

And this friend of a friend shows up his plastic trash newly bought Acer laptop. He was just showing off his benchmark scores games etc. In passing he said no apple laptop can beat his plastic 600 laptop in scores so we did some cinenebench geekbench runs I dont know how his scores were like 5-10% higher. We also did a test run of tomb raider he was getting 5-10 fps more than me. Since i was the only apple laptop in the group I felt really embarassed everyone taking a pass over me. I am not tech savvy at all. I thought my laptop have some issues so I thought Ill google it thats when I found this review Cranking out a mind-blowing score of 4 862 not only did the AMD-equipped Swift 3 smash its Intel twin 3 432 on our Geekbench 5.0 overall performance benchmark it also smoked the 1 799 13-inch MacBook Pro Intel Core i5-1030NG7 CPU 16GB of RAM 4 399 . Here too they are getting bettery scores in Acer than my macbook. Is this Windows vs MacOS thing ? Should I return my macbook ? Why did I pay 3 times apple some Acer trash has better performance ? Can Apple sue Acer ?

The two displays are an Aorus CV27F an Orion SLED2468W. The Aorus is a brand new computer monitor. However the Orion is an older TV screen. got it back in 2012 . Good reliable display all things considered onlt problem it's ever has is about 20-30 pixes of underscan. But in System Prefs. - gt Displays there's a lovly little slider I can use the drag the underscan around. Last week I finally upgraded my gaming monitor the Aorus. I use the Oprion as a second display have it Verticly next the main Aorus. The bug I'm running into is that it can either be rotated OR underscanned but not both. When I select 270 rotation the underscan button goes 0 is greyed out. But when I set it back Standard I can adjust the underscan. Even following this guide manually change screen properties I can't get it stick. I was able change the values in the file key framebuffer-rotation /key integer 80 integer // This is the key for 270 rotation key pscn /key integer 900 /integer // This is the key for underscan. 1000 is no change it goes down from there. but when I rebot the computer the display is rotated no underscanned. Is this a but in OS X? Or is this a compatibility thing trying this on a really old 8 years now? display? Edit Ok so I know that this is possible. When I boot into windows I can easily use the Radeon Adrenaline software quickly set the scaling underscan. So... it’s just a Mac bug.

I spent quite a bit upgrading everything when I first purchased it back in 2011 but because the specs have changed so much since then I don't know what I'll be getting soon would be a true upgrade especially I don't have the money go as high-end as I did before.

1,glo8b4,mac,2,2020/05/18 13:51:38,Afternoon,I love my Mac. I hate my Mac. I find that for the most part cloud based services for Mac have made things a lot better easier. However I’m a sergeant in the National Guard need sign some important documents for my soldiers. To keep it simple COVID going on there’s very little help make my personal MacBook work for me without spending money do simple tasks. I got the 7 day free trial for adobe sign after that it’s 15 a month! I’m normally pretty okay just finding a work around such as printing all the documents scanning them back in but that could happen several times revisions need be made. Idk this post seems really trivial because ultimately I’ll get this done I just find it funny I’ve spent the last couple hours avoiding spending an absurd amount of money on a feature I’d only use very little I wasn’t having do some tasks from home. I could see the value in an everyday company purchasing this service. But... i kinda miss the good old days of being able pirate stuff that weren’t using continually profit off of—just apps that needed do one quick thing. Not that I think pirating is sustainable just way easier. And that came risks drawbacks too but at least back then did purchase something it was for good. I can’t even use microsoft word anymore because I don’t pay for it monthly. It seems like word is closer an essential application not a pay use service. Also another frustration Due the precise formatting of the evaluations we are doing there’s no simple command make the all upper case characters turn all lower case. I tried creating a keyboard shortcut through the “all applications” but not sure how actually make that work. Working on a mid 2012 macbook. To conclude this post I almost wish that convenience didn’t come the price of over complicated technical troubles. Back in the day your pencil broke just sharpened it. Now keep up the pace of things need have some deep understanding of how a robot thinks it’s not always logical. I love my Mac. I hate my Mac.

I just finished a month long quarantine project of completely rebuilding an early 2011 unibody MBP that was pretty much unusable for the last 5 years as all fans were constantly throttled along CPU. This MacBook belonged my partner who just got a 2016 MBP. Essentially I converted the computer into the highest upgrade available for this era. Below 'll find the comparison between the upgrades I've done. 2.3GHz MacBook Pro Early 2011 Original Technical Specifications Power Built-in 63.5-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery 1236 cycles Software Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard -- max OS High Sierra v10.13.6 Processor 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 L3 cache 3MB shared Memory 4GB two 2GB SO-DIMMs of 1333MHz DDR3 SDRAM Hard drive 320GB Serial ATA 5400 rpm Slot-loading optical drive 8x SuperDrive DVD R DL/DVD RW/CD-RW Graphics Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor 384MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared main memory Expansion One Thunderbolt port up 10 Gbps one FireWire 800 port up 800 Mbps two USB 2.0 ports up 480 Mbps SDXC card slot Wireless Wi-Fi based on IEEE 802.11n specification Bluetooth 2.1 EDR Enhanced Data Rate wireless technology 2.9GHz MacBook Pro Mid 2012 Upgraded Specifications Power NewerTech 65-watt-hour NuPower Battery 3 cycles Software Mac OS X v10.15.4 Catalina Processor 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 3520M L3 cache 4MB shared Memory 16 GB 2 x 8.0GB 1600MHz DDR3L SO-DIMM PC12800 204 Pin Storage 1TB Crucial MX500 SSD Slot-loading optical drive Removed replaced 1TB Samsung 860 QVO SSD via Optical Superdrive Caddy Tray Graphics Intel HD Graphics 4000 processor Expansion One Thunderbolt port up 10 Gbps one FireWire 800 port up 800 Mbps two USB 3.0 ports up 5 Gbps SDXC card slot Wireless 802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking IEEE 802.11a/b/g compatible. Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology Handoff Funny because NOT ONE of these installs solved the fan problem. That lied in the palm rest sensor trackpad cable a simple 40 part was the fix. The upgrades were simple the most difficult part was waiting for components ship during a global pandemic. This thing runs as fast as my partner's 2016 MBP by the way. I absolutely love this Mac as it can still browse the web multitask smoothly. I'm a web designer this thing suits my needs better than the lame Dell Latitude my work offers. Let me know have a similar MacBook or have any questions about how do this!

Apple has refurbished 2019 quad core models for about 1050 tax included while the education discount I can get a 2020 model for about 1300 tax included . I was dead set on getting the 2019 model saving some money the only hesitation is the reliability of the butterfly keyboard. I’ve been on many forums apparently the 2019 keyboard is better than previous iterations a large majority of people who have the 2019 version haven’t experienced any problems. The only one I frequently see are that the keys sometimes get stuck when dust or crumbs get in them blowing condensed air in it fixes the problem. I just don’t have think about the possibility of the keyboard failing even though it’s still covered under the 4 year keyboard replacement warranty. So just wanted know some of y’alls opinions. Have experienced issues the 2019 butterfly keyboard or any butterfly keyboard? Would suggest I spend the extra 250 for peace of mind that my keyboard is going work? I’m really torn on which one get so thank in advance for any feedback.

136,gqdeln,Dell,36,2020/05/26 07:53:32,Morning,Dell's XPS 15 model numbering is out of control XPS 15 9530 2013 - Okay I can see what's going on here it's their high end line 9xxx 15 x5xx released in 2013 xx3x. Makes sense. XPS 15 9550 2015 - Still makes sense given the above decoder ring. XPS 15 9560 2017 - It appears the year portion slipped out of sync. XPS 15 9570 2018 - The year portion is still wrong but at least model number is predictably bigger than the previous year's model. XPS 15 7590 2019 - Dell Let's take the previous year's model rearrange the numbers in the most confusing way possible. The new model number is now 2k numerically smaller than the previous year's. XPS 15 9500 2020 - Dell Woah we really screwed up last year's number. What were we thinking let's go back the previous scheme. But wait it's now 2020 so the year portion rolled over would make the newest model numerically lower than even the 2013 model. Eh screw it just ship it.

1,gqvgot,Dell,0,2020/05/27 03:42:40,Night,Inspiron 13 5379 battery keyboard issues After two years of owning my laptop the battery has suddenly deteriorated barely lasts two hours even everything is on low settings. It is also giving me the error message Your battery can no longer provide sufficient power your system needs be replaced whenever my laptop starts up so I don't think this is a simple wear tear issue. Furthermore I've actually had keyboard issues since I purchased the product in 2018 some letters on the left side of my keyboard being inconsistently unresponsive. By this I mean some days all the keys work as expected but other days certain keys on the left side of the keyboard don't work unless I press them numerous times. I've tried many support tips online for fixing the keyboard issue but none have a permanent fix this new battery issue surfacing there must clearly be a hardware issue from bad manufacturing.

It's been around a year since I've had it I've always contemplated repasting. I've read that undervolting was usually enough repasting would help but WOW am I impressed. I would idle around 50 bump up around 60 once running some basic programs. Now it's nothing for me stay 40 under load idle at 30-35. If anyone has been debating whether give it a shot I'd highly recommend it!

After disabling TurboBoost the temps were much more reasonable but I’d like make it cooler. I was recommended undervolt the CPU. Great idea! Except I’m not sure what I should set it ! Ex. -1.20V ect... I had a gaming PC but since im going college soon I figured I buy a gaming laptop that I can also use for school needs. Im new the whole laptop thing optimizing it so any help on undervolting would be greatly appreciated. I also saw that can undervolt the GPU is that also something I should do? If so how low should I take it? Cheers. Edit btw loving the laptop my original PC had a GTX 1050 an i3 so being able crank settings up get 60 FPS is incredible Ok thanks for coming my TedTalks

3,gqkb4a,Dell,1,2020/05/26 14:01:29,Afternoon,Intel 9260 in XPS 9550 has very bad Bluetooth range connection My wifi connection on my 9550 had gotten absurdly spotty which was problematic due the working from home situation. Following the advice of this subreddit I swapped the OEM card for an Intel 9260. Swap was easy connected the antenna cables in the reverse direction as one is supposed black white/white black replaced the stock drivers Intel ones etc. The wifi connection was immediately better but the Bluetooth is miserable. Maybe 5 meters of range connection cuts out through a thin wall. If I cover the headphone the Bluetooth receiver my hand or turn my head away from the computer it cuts the connection. It does not disconnect the headphones though just cuts the audio which is what is confusing me. Headphones don’t disconnect until outside the range I’d expect them last. Any advice on potential fixes would be greatly appreciated or more opinions that I just got dud of a card . Thanks in advance.

1,gqohly,Dell,1,2020/05/26 18:25:20,Afternoon,Dell G5 5587 Freezing/Shutting Down My Dell G5 is pretty new but is constantly freezing shutting down. It even shut down as I was typing this post! I'm pretty unintelligent when it comes computer hardware so I'll try my best explain everything. I've seen some similar issues occuring for others the G5 but none of the solutions have made sense or seemed work for me. The laptop gets insanely hot the fan gets pretty loud while I'm running World of Warcraft on anything but the bare minimum settings The graphic slider is a 1-10 scale. Anything above 1 puts it into overdrive . But the heat sound isn't the biggest issue the bigger issue is that it freezes shuts down at seemingly random times. The shut down is a bit odd the screen goes black but the laptop power light stays on it doesn't sound like it dies. It's almost like it goes sleep. But can't wake it up have manually turn it off back on. It's done that quite a few times while playing WoW today alone. The other issue is the freezing which feels kinda like the same problem. It just happens out of nowhere everything continues sound like normal but the screen is frozen in place forcing a manual reboot. I've done a diagnostics check everything was fine I believe I'm up date on my BIOS unless there's something I'm unaware of. It seems like all my drivers are up date. I'm really not sure what's going on. I haven't done anything funky it so it should all be on factory stock settings. Any help would be super appreciated.

I just make sure because I've read that only supports 16gb of RAM so it means max 16gb per slot or 16 GB total. 16gb per slot makes much more sense me... also I have Intel R Core TM i7-500U CPU 2.70GHz Intel R HD Graphics 620 I make an egpu but I'm from Argentina nobody here sells the m.2 cable only the one PCIe so that project is for later. It's there any better intel processor integrated graphics or another solution that would significantly improve my graphics specs in order be able play some games. Thank !

I am thinking of getting a laptop for that I need some guidance wisdom regarding the configuration option. So I am thinking of getting a laptop around the 15 inch or 17 inch range for content creation photo editing video editing podcasting . I'm not too worried about the CPU. I have an idea of what I based on the available options. There are some things I am unsure about 1. Screen I might not make 4k video right away but I keep this laptop around for awhile. Is the 4k screen worth the investment here? or am I just throwing money battery life away? 2. RAM Is 16 GB enough here? or should I go for 32 GB? 3. GPU I have an option of the GTX 1650 TI or RTX 2060. The RTX has 2 GB more vram. Obviously the RTX 2060 is the better card it won't hurt but is it overkill? I know these questions might be weird since the machine is already expensive but I can get away the GTX 1650 TI save money some battery life it might be a better fit. Are there anything else I should consider when looking at the various options?

I wanted add additional RAM so I bought a Crucial 16gb DDR4 2666. I followed Dell's manual on how install the ram power off disconnect battery install ram reconnect boot back up. After I closed up everything powered back on I saw the keyboard light up the computer running but nothing on the screen. I waited a few minutes still nothing. When I looked closer I saw very faintly the Windows login so I tried increase the brightness but nothing happened. I then plugged it into an external monitor the monitor was able display everything but the laptop was still dark. To make sure the laptop registered the ram I pulled up task manager it recognized the computer having 24gb of ram. To make sure it wasn't the new ram doing this I powered everything off uninstalled the new ram then powered the laptop back on. Same thing happened dark screen. I connected dell support they said that the motherboard would need be replaced but my warranty would cover it. They mentioned I would need send it in it would take 7-10 business days repair. What should I do? Is there a way I can fix this because I don't wait for it. Also is there a way prevent this? I need the additional ram. Does the ram have be matching like both have be 16gb or both have be 8gb? Dell says it can support up the 32gb. Thanks!

Would it last longer than my original since this technology is a lot better faster?

I switched the intel driver anyway because everyone wrote that the Nvidia is usually louder but the fan still spins up most of the time. There are stackoverflow threads for the XPS 15 but most of the solutions didn't have a proper effect on my machine. On one point I tried the things of this blog post I installed configured i8kmon but I didn't hear any difference until someone pointed out that I have use dell-bios-fan-control This worked indeed! The system is much more silent now. However now I'm using this config for /etc/i8kmon.conf External program control the fans set config i8kfan /usbin/i8kfan Report status on stdout override --verbose option set config verbose 0 Status check timeout seconds override --timeout option set config timeout 2 Temperature display unit C/F override --unit option set config unit C Temperature threshold at which the temperature is displayed in red set config t high 80 Minimum expected fan speed set config min speed 2000 Temperature thresholds fan speeds low ac high ac low batt high batt These were tested on the I8000. If have a different Dell laptop model should check the BIOS temperature monitoring set the appropriate thresholds here. In doubt start low values gradually rise them until the fans are not always on when the cpu is idle. set config 0 0 0 -1 55 -1 60 set config 1 1 1 50 65 55 70 set config 2 2 2 60 75 65 80 set config 3 2 2 70 128 75 128 Speed values are set here avoid i8kmon probe them at every time it starts. set status leftspeed 0 1000 2000 3000 set status rightspeed 0 1000 2000 3000 end of file it doesn't feels optimal for me. But maybe it is. So my question is Does anyone have another advice /or a better config for keeping this notebook silent?

I have also tried undervolting ThrottleStop though I did not notice much difference TBH. Currently at -0.125mV for CPU Core Cache -0.55mV for Intel GPU. No changes the NVIDIA GPU. In Dell Command Power Manager I like have it Quiet which has me idling all my work programs open around 53-55'C. About 52'C when set Cool . Running a Normal 8 thread 1024M TS Bench gets the temps up 86-88'C before hitting PL 1 throttle on the CORE GPU EDP OTHER on RING when set Quiet . Even when not on Quiet the laptop can't complete these longer benchmarks without throttling it appears. Gaming performance has also increased a bit fans are not as crazy though still cannot max out Halo Reach on Halo MCC. If it matters I am using a Dell 130W USB-C dock the laptop is on a fanless stand that allows airflow underneath. Now I am wondering I should still repaste the CPU GPU before having give back the Torx screwdriver my friend who moves away in 6 days. My main question is is it a good idea use the Noctua NT-H1 that came the NH-U14S CPU cooler we put on a lab desktop build about a month ago? Will it still be good? Will there be enough? Or should I be using a different paste altogether? If I can use it my temps will improve I'd prefer that as this paste is free I can get it tonight rather than waiting on Amazon etc. I believe the Noctua website says unused paste is fine for 2 years from first open would prefer having decent temps for low cost rather than unnecessarily spending for an extra degree or two cooler. Also I am going do the repaste should I do the thermal padding as well ? If so any recommendations on what buy for that? Much appreciated! Let me know any additional information is required.

I had an issue power surge the other day when I was using my desktop. I did get a warning which stated that the overclocking has failed asked me restart the computer. Now the computer doesn't boot into windows. No post no beeps the input-output devices such as keyboard mouse monitor speakers aren't receiving power or at least aren't being detected. I thought this must have something do BIOS hence I reset the CMOS the jumper. I also unplugged replugged every wire from the motherboard make sure it isn't a glitch. I tried using a single RAM on the 1st slot. It didn't work then I tried removing all the memory but I hear no beeps. I removed the GPU I hear no beeps. All fans seem be functioning all the components are receiving power including the GPU all the internal lights seem be functioning too. I even tried discharge the board by unplugging the main power chord holding the power button for a min or two. At this point I have no way tell its a motherboard CPU or PSU issue as I have no spare parts. If anyone is facing the same issue or something similar I would like seek help. Other details CPU Intel i-7 5820k GPU Nvidia 980 Memory 16GB Ram stock PSU 800 watt Please help me asap. Thank !

My replacement laptop probably won't arrive until mid-June so I keep this machine for as long as I can within the 30 day window so I'm not without one for long. My question is do they need RECEIVE the laptop by the 30th day or could I theoretically process my return ship it back them on that day delivery back Dell a few days later?

2,gqaeby,Dell,0,2020/05/26 04:48:22,Night,Has anyone benchmarked 3200MHz vs 2666MHz memory in a Dell laptop? For the laptops that are capable of supporting memory speeds of 3200MHz has any one benchmarked a machine the stock 2666MHz memory vs the 3200MHz memory? I realize that some of the lines do not have upgradable memory or do not support the faster speeds. For gaming this site seems indicate that it makes no difference. This makes sense me as the games are probably limited by the graphics their own dedicated memory rather than the CPU I don't think that high-end CPUs go 100% game play . They also tested on full PCs - maybe the thermal limiting of a laptop has an interaction the memory speed?

1,gqdxcp,Dell,4,2020/05/26 08:20:55,Morning,Help needed for sticky XPS palmrest Hi all I've had my XPS 15 9560 for about three years now a few months back I realised the palmrest had gotten somewhat sticky as a sticker or piece of tape was stuck there removed leaving a gummy coating behind . I'm of course surprised as I thought it was a carbon fibre coating last I checked carbon fibre doesn't become sticky. Anyway I live in a tropical climate so maybe there may have been some plastic coating that has since deteriorated become sticky. Has anyone faced a similar situation found a suitable fix? I've tried cleaning the area detergent but the light scrubbing has resulted in visible scuffs reinforcing my belief that it's just a carbon fibre lookalike plastic layer which is breaking down. Any input will be appreciated! Thanks!
1,gqdu7m,Dell,1,2020/05/26 08:16:16,Morning,Dell XPS 9350 screen replacement - advice? Had a little accident where the laptop took a fall. No physical damage can be seen fell about a foot a half onto tile but I'm getting the 7 white lights 2 amber lights from the front display light. A bit of googling shows that it's an LCD failure. We bought this from Costco in the beginning of 2017 along a squaretrade warranty which is typically expired. We have a geek squad apt on Thursday for them do a diagnostic give us a quote. It's my wife's computer she uses for work she loves it - never an issue it. Not very much personal stuff on there just some documents. Is it worth getting fixed? We paid 1300 for it it's about 3.5 years old now. I've never used geek squad before for repair but I'm guessing it's going be at least 300- 400. Are there any tricks I can try get this thing going again? I hooked up the external HDMI through the USB C connector I got the Windows update screen at about 7% every time it turns the computer off giving me the blinking light error.

2,gq49i8,Dell,1,2020/05/25 20:19:46,Evening,Touchpad left click is intermittent on 9370 I have a two-year old XPS 9370. Over the past two days I started having issues left-clicking on my touchpad - when I click there is a probability that the click doesn't register. The probability seems vary wildly - sometimes almost all clicks register other times almost none do. If the click doesn't work additional pressure the touchpad usually fixes the issue. The amount of extra pressure needed be applied also seems vary considerably from very little a lot. Right click seems work 100% of the time. I've also found that when the issue occurs while holding down the left mouse button I can carefully vary the pressure activate deactivate mouse1 without making any clicking noises.

I have seen several posts people saying that they received a discount when they asked for it directly. I chatted a dell representative then they said they would help me get a discount on Memorial Day. They told me email them on memorial day then they gave me their dell employee email.

I've built several gaming desktops over the last 15 years have only gotten cheaper laptops for everyday tasks but changes in life have made me decide go a more powerful laptop until I'm ready build another machine. That being said I have no problem tearing equipment down replacing thermal paste but I have 0 interest in doing it I don't have while it is still in it's return warranty window I certainly don't do it. How has everyone's experience dells warranty service replacement parts? I did a remote session a support tech showed him that the CPU sensors register 100c just during boot up so either there's a serious hardware malfunction or they just never applied thermal paste. Would I be better off submitting for a refund getting something else this is out of box condition? I like everything about the machine so I'd rather not go thru the hassle of returning it get something else I'm just weary about it already when laptops weakest spots are their overheating this thing has done it out of box.

Due the lockdown I've not been using my office as much when I recently tried docking I was not able get the laptop recognized the monitor over USB-C. I get no video no indication that the monitor is recognizing the laptop. I do get a warning about insufficent power The PC isn't charging from Windows but nothing in device manager or in any of the event logs that I can see. What I've tried All drivers are up date. BIOS on the laptop has been updated tried 1.6.1 1.7.3 1.7.4 . Monitor firmware M3B106 is current. I've tried the original OEM USB-C cable the 3.1 Gen 2 cable that was previously working AND a NEW 3.1 Gen 2 cable. I've done a complete reinstall of Windows 10. No dice. Monitor works fine on other inputs is recognized my desktop machine over DisplayPort also shows up when hooked the laptop via HDMI albiet at 30Hz refresh which is painful use . I do not have any other devices that can output video over USB-C test so I can't rule out USB-C on the monitor itself although I have zero reason suspect that it's bad . Open suggestions or thoughts. Apologies this isn't the right venue or format for this sort of thing. Edits because spelling is hard. Also added firmware versions.

I understand that Windows 10 uses about 15GB I definitely have about 20GB of more stuff installed but it's reading it as having about 867GB of space available. I can't find anything on the system explaining this missing 30 or so GB. I'm trying figure out a way view the hard drive contents in boot mode or something but I'm struggling figure out a way do that as well. My theories right now are that there are hidden files I bought this used customized so the first thing I did was completely wipe the drive Windows 7 is still saved on it somewhere or there is a recovery file saved that takes up about as much space as what's currently on the system I think I spotted this once but I'm not certain I didn't know it was a good idea just get rid of it but now I'd like I find it again.

If 've opened up your brand new Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 for me are setting up all your peripherals get ready. apparently this is pretty common - can find the right threads of course Your mouse connects works lags. Horribly. It seems fall asleep takes 10 seconds of shaking it wake back up. You go the customer service for the mouse brand because your laptop is brand new so it can't be the problem. Wrong. There's a little box checked deep in the settings that's wrecking your day. To fix this - go device manager - Bluetooth - Intel R Wireless Bluetooth R - double click open - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow the computer turn off this device save power To recap My mouse appeared fall asleep after 1.5 seconds of inactivity would take a good 10 seconds wake back up. I googled those exact words mouse falls asleep in various combinations no avail. Lo behold that's exactly what was happening because the damn settings were letting it turn off save power. To find the threads have apparently look up mouse/trackpad intermittently freezes I really hope this helps someone. I now the mouse I'd originally bought returned back instead of the replacement I bought because the first one was the same brand as the wired mouse I'm used . rip. x200B Tl dr Dell should fix their configurations so people can actually use Bluetooth mice
1,gpyr2a,Dell,1,2020/05/25 14:24:10,Afternoon,G5 5587 2018 model stuck at Dell logo after BIOS update Hey all basically what's written on the tin. The other day I installed a BIOS update via Dell support assist the next time I tried turn it on it wouldn't boot past the Dell logo. It eventually goes the Dell recovery screen while the scan repair options complete successfully when I try reboot I get the same problem. Any ideas? I would rather not refresh the OS but that looks like the only option I have left. Has anyone experienced this before? I googled around but none of the things I found seemed work. Thanks in advance! 😃
1,gpyoq9,Dell,0,2020/05/25 14:20:16,Afternoon,Fatal PCIe error NetApp HBA installed R610  Hey there I'm having trouble getting my test servers up running. I have two R610s 1x Gen I 1x Gen II NetApp HBAs 111-00625 D0 installed. It was possible boot over an USB drive install FreeNAS however on every following boot the server reports a fatal pcie failure. I have two servers two HBAs it happens both of them. When trying update the aerver's firmware using a SmartISO it showed the following detailed error I doubt that both HBAs or servers are actually broken so why could this happen? I'm using a similar tho not identical hba in another server it's doing great.

0,gpxqgy,Dell,3,2020/05/25 13:25:03,Afternoon,Just Bought a 4K OLED XPS 15 7590 i7 GTX 1650 16GB. Lightweight Gaming Possible? Hi all I just bought this XPS 15 7590 outfitted a 4K OLED display core i7 GTX 1650 16GB of ram 512GB SSD I have a few questions. It was on sale I had a 10% coupon for signing up for emails from Dell so I ended up paying only 1 449.12 exactly for this model. Is this a pretty good deal? I've heard that these tend suffer from not the best thermals some throttling I'm planning on using it mainly for web browsing movie watching music production hopefully some lightweight gaming I realize this laptop may be overkill for what I plan on using it for but I just like using nice laptops as I spend a majority of most of my days using them. My biggest concern is that it may have some thermal issues when gaming. I choose do most of my gaming on consoles but I do like play the occasional game on PC such as Overwatch The Sims 4 etc. Definitely not extremely demanding games or anything. Would this laptop be fine for handling those games without major thermal issues or throttling? I'm perfectly comfortable undervolting needed. I just don't it run extremely hot. I'm also wondering about the portability I mainly use my laptop in my home on a desk but I do like take it from room room use it on the couch or in the bed. Is this laptop too heavy/bulky or would it be pretty comfortable for use like this? Thanks in advance!
12,gpl2ma,Dell,8,2020/05/24 22:48:02,Evening,Dell 17 RTX 2060 MQ vs Quadro RTX 3000 FIGHT! Hey guys it is this time again where we debate about GeForce vs Quadro where people ask the Quadro can be used for gaming other stuff. I am interested in the upcoming XPS 17 or Precision 5750 however for reasons I would prefer the precision over the Dell Linux intel wifi etc. . What I use this for Programming robot simulations lil' gaming a lil' machine learning majority I do in the cloud . So Naturally for me a Quadro is not advantagous. But leaving higher price the side it seems that the Quadro is actually better than the 2060 so I wanted explore that. because it seems that the Quadro is based on the 2070? In this comparison for example the Quadro seems do better even having more shaders more pipelines higher boost clock but also 80 Watts vs 65!!! Is that even possible in the 17 considering I would a 8-core i7 that? My question is If money is no problem Is the Quadro better in the above task than the Gefore? And will it be really consuming 80W vs. the 2060s 65W?

1,gpuhny,Dell,0,2020/05/25 10:18:11,Morning,Latitude 7400 2-in-1 battery drain when off I bought this machine a couple weeks ago from Dell Outlet New . It's a slightly older model an i5-8365U a 52WHr battery. Pretty nice except I charge 100% shut down from the menu turn it back on 7-10 hours later it's at 85% charge. I see many other people have similar problems. I tried disabling fast startup unchecking the IME power saving option always disconnect from network when asleep. I even disabled WLAN Bluetooth. Doesn't help. But this is strange too Last night I shut down a fully charged battery. Today I plug it in turn it on it shows 85%--the usual problem. I let it charge up 86% shut it down unplug it wait a few minutes turn it back on. It shows the charge is 100% . This is the reading in the BIOS in Windows. Thoughts? I'd assume a bad battery but I see threads like this one just don't know. I was going do some more testing see about this magical return 100% before submitting a support ticket. I got 5 years of ProSupport Plus when I purchased. Kinda disappointed. My other machine a Latitude 7490 from a couple years ago is solid.

1,gpu16q,Dell,1,2020/05/25 09:51:47,Morning,Vostro fingerprint reader question Hi I recently bought a 2019 Vostro 7590 now I'm wondering it comes any sort of fingerprint scanner. On the website it says that there is an optional fingerprint reader but looking at the purchase options both before after I bought the device I cannot find a way actually select a fingerprint reader the device. I have also been checking different drivers although there is a fingerprint driver available for this device it is saying that there is no reader installed. Am I missing something in the software or is the purchase flow just set up really badly? This is really confusing me I don't know why the marketing material would say there is a scanner but the actual configuration does not.

1,gpsgko,Dell,2,2020/05/25 08:20:18,Morning,Dual boot two Windows 10 on one SSD? Greetings I attempted install an additional Windows 10 OS on the same SSD. All was well until I got the blue screen Bad pool call . I'm working the Dell XPS 15 9500 1TB SSD. 1 I was able successfully partition a new drive on the same SSD. 2 I was able update bios install Windows 10 on the new partition. 3 Oddly when setting up the second OS it did not request a new product key but used the same from the original OS. 4 I accidently installed wrong network drivers for a different model Dell don't judge I've been Mac the past 5 yrs . At this point the blue screen bad pool call started appearing after 5 minutes of run time. I believe this may be a potential culprit. 5 Is there an issue installing two of the same version OS on one SSD proper partitioning ? My desired endstate is have one OS for ordinary daily taskings work the other OS clean install tuned for Music production other content creating activities all bloatware unnecessary programs gone or disaabled . I'm sure there's a million posts about this here on Reddit but would like get input advice from Dell specific users. Any help would be appreciated guys!
1,gps0k2,Dell,4,2020/05/25 07:54:18,Morning,Order delay - Parts on backorder? It'll be at least over 3 weeks from date order was placed the estimated ship date. I wish sales would inform which part it was that was holding things up. They were vague but did mention that parts were being waited on build.Maybe I could have made a different selection shorten wait time presented an option.. They did mention a few pre-builts but not close my needed specs. Is Dell's supply chain still adversely impacted from the Nashville tornados?

7,gpje33,Dell,2,2020/05/24 20:28:27,Evening,Testing more CPU coolers on Alienware Aurora R8 In my journey try other cooling solutions on my Alienware Aurora R8 I tried installing a Dynatron K555 which didn't fit as well as an EVGA water cooler. The EVGA water cooler caused some abrupt clock rate drops possibly because it had a 3-pin power connector vs the 4-pin. I'm not sure this is the cause - however I'm speculating it may have been. I compared the noise levels while testing in Cinebench R20 observed a major reduction in fan noise the liquid cooler. Due the reduced clearance caused by the power supply I believe liquid cooling is going be the best choice reduce fan speed while a Dynatron K666 cooler will be the easiest plug--play solution albeit a lot of noise . x200B The information in this video is applicable Dell computers the same hinged power supply bay new XPS Precision Optiplex desktops. x200B The first video where i tested the K555 posted last weekend is The new video where I test the K666 the EVGA liquid cooler is x200B I'm making an effort improve the quality of these videos new gear trying be more succinct better overall flow - so please provide any feedback have .

The fact that my Pentium laptop does the same work but doesn't goto sleep is surprising seeing that its a 5 year old model compared this garbage that is only 2 years old.

Shipped the i7-7700HQ UHD My xps is struggling run two monitors without excessive taring freezing. Both are being connected into the laptop i/o I am not running on a doing station. All power settings have been modified including those for what do when closing the lid. All drivers are up date there are no outstanding updates. The first monitor is a 1920x1080 at 60hz through HDMI. The second is a 3440x1440 on USB-C which can run at 120hz through the Intel HD 630 however I have had run it at 60hz for it be use able due the the screen issues. The issue can start on something as simple as a single chrome tab running YouTube on one screen another chrome tab or application running on the other. When I look at the windows performance monitor utilisation on everything is low including the discrete GPU except for the integrated graphics which is stuck at 100%. From what I've read online this is due the dedicated 128MB VRAM which cannot be increased according Dell themselves. Is this what's causing the issue? Has anyone else had this or knows a resolution? It seems incredibly bizarre make a flagship a model lots of memory a beefy GPU yet have such low VRAM is it really just this?
3,gphpdx,Dell,13,2020/05/24 18:24:02,Afternoon,Avg. 3 hours of battery life on XPS 13 2-in-1 7390 Hi I'm wondering how normal this is in your experience. I have an XPS 13 2-in-1 7390 that's about 3 months old. I rarely take it off my desk so most of the time it's plugged in. I started using it at other places recently noticed the very poor battery life on this device. I have the i7 4K model I understand that 4K makes the battery worse but it shouldn't be this bad right? Most of my work is just Microsoft Office browser-based nothing CPU-intensive. I tend leave the battery settings on better battery but not battery saver. Dell claims 16 hours on FHD 10 hours on UHD but I've never gotten more than 4 hours. Does anyone know what's wrong? Today I manually selected sleep before unplugging it. After 8 hours of it sitting at the table it dropped from 100% 76%. I didn't touch it nor wake it. I checked battery usage all programs states 0% so it's not something draining the battery on the background. Thanks in advance!

7,gpa6v3,Dell,17,2020/05/24 10:43:51,Morning,XPS 13 2 in 1 struggles 4K HDR video playback I've got a XPS 13 2 in 1 7390 i7-1065G7 16gb RAM FHD display that I connect an external 4k monitor In general most things are peachy but whenever I try play 4k HDR content I get some serious stutters. These stutters aren't just the video but other UI elements start slow jitter as well. Here's a screenshot of task manager as a video is playing on my external monitor every peak in the video decode graph is a stutter. I'm on the latest graphics drivers bios. The stutter isn't buffering due slow internet because I regularly get 100 mbps. I also downloaded a full 4k HDR 60FPS video instead of streaming from youtube still had stuttering. CPU temps are around 55-60 when the video is playing which I don't think would cause a large amount thermal throttling but I'm really not sure. I guess my question is Are the stutters because I'm hitting the upper threshold of what Intel's iris plus graphics can do or might there be another reason?

2,gpfxiu,Dell,5,2020/05/24 16:24:10,Afternoon,Dell Power Manager - Thermal Management Make Optimized mode default? Dell G7 7590 Hi So basically the title is the question is there any way make the optimized mode default? It keeps putting me at high performance but I only that at certain times. So I have the G7 when I hit the F7 key it maxes my fans puts me in high performance mode which I love do when I'm playing games as it keeps my laptop as cool as possible while hitting max performance. However when I exit the game hit F7 again get out of the high performance mode it seems I get put back into the ultra performance thermal management in dell power. Also happens when I reset the computer. It's not a huge deal go into Dell Power Manager switch it but I was wondering I could just make the optimized mode my default. Also in the control panel power options there is no Dell Setting only balanced sometimes high performance. It's mostly just how long the screen stays on basic stuff like that but I'm not 100% sure. I had do a fresh install because I messed something up but I swear before I did that there was a specific dell power option although I could be wrong. Any way get that back? I love this laptop it's great Dell has been great me this is for sure a first-world problem...BUT I could do something about it it would be a huge convenience for me. Thanks!

Sometimes a restart will fix it other times it will resume right after a restart. - Dock Freezes so the mouse keyboard external sound external screen no longer update the sound stays in an annoying looping pattern. A restart will fix it till the next time it happens. - My first Win10 bluesrceens! I've read about them seen screenshots but I now am getting the real deal on my shiny new 2000 XPS 9300. There is apparently also a new firmware update for the WD19TB dock that someone on this sub was kind enough report earlier today. As of yet it's not available in the US won't take my service tag. Perhaps it will somehow fix all these issues but I don't have my fingers crossed.

After 7 years my MBP which held up remarkably well I decided it was time upgrade opted for the 2019 XPS 15 7590 i9 the 4k OLED display. This is way more computer than I need but I figure for 1500 it lasts more than 5 years it will be fine the display is the most important thing me. So I'm excited. x200B It is my first Windows since I was a kid on Windows XP though I don't know how set it up! It seems like I should do a clean install of the OS get rid of any bloatware that is preinstalled. What is a good antivirus? It comes a year of McAfee but it seems like Windows Defender might be better? x200B Finally I usually stick mainstream sites but occasionally I'll find an old movie that is literally impossible stream or buy I'll torrent it. Mac I've never worried but should I be extremely weary of torrenting sites like putlocker on a windows? x200B Anyone who has had experience the 7590 also let me know what think! I switched Android last year too so I'm excited have that cross functionality.

I have two laptops that I'll typically use for work...one is a 2018 Dell G5 the other is a 2020 Dell Vostro 7590. The Vostro 7590 outclasses the G5 in every way except one...the GPU. The Vostro is running the Nvidia GTX 1050 while the G5 uses the GTX 1650. When using Chrome my work Gmail chugs on the 7590 but is as smooth as butter on the G5. I'd prefer work on my 7590 because it's much lighter easier haul around but I can't figure out why Gmail struggles so much on it. One thought I had was the Chrome extensions but the same extensions run on both machines. My work email works fine in other browsers but I'm not able run the Chrome extensions that way. My other thought was maybe the GPU but performance monitor shows that it's barely being utilized while using Gmail. Is there anything else I could try? Note - My personal Gmail account runs just fine. I open another Chrome instance without the extensions utilize it best. x200B Spec Comparison Dell Vostro 7590 Processor Intel Core i7 - 9750H GPU Nvidia GTX 1050 RAM 16 GB SSD s 1 256 GB NVME SSD 2 500 GB SATA SSD x200B Dell G5 Processor Intel Core i5 8th gen - I forgot the exact model GPU Nvidia GTX 1650 RAM 8 GB SSD s 1 256 GB NVME SSD 2 1TB HDD

I immediately put it sleep but it woke up when I tried dry the keyboard so I had shut it down properly about a minute after the spill. I haven’t turned it back on since so I’m not sure it works or not. After I cleaned up all the milk on the table in the area I disassembled the laptop unplugged the battery. I was aiming properly clean the keyboard but the back of the keyboard was covered by Mylar which dissuaded me from wanting peel it back access the keyboard. The motherboard SSD memory cards were all completely dry. A few hours after that I used a toothbrush externally wipe water on the keyboard battery still disconnected . I would like advice on how best deal this situation. I have some very important group work I’ve been working on it for 4 months now that is a large project due the first week of June. I cannot use the software I need on any other computer in my house. When will it be safe power my laptop on? Should I disassemble it again access the keyboard clean it? Another reason I didn’t originally is because the screw above the display cable was stripped so I couldn’t properly remove the motherboard fully. I’m optimistic my laptop will be fine but I’d like avoid a decrease in performance. I tried calling the dell technical support but they are closed on the weekends. This laptop is 3-4 years old probably not covered by warranty anymore. For reference the precision 5520 has the same chassis as the XPS 25. Edit is there anywhere that specializes in fixing dell laptops that I can take it it has issues? I’m in the Bay Area so most things are closed....

I am tired. 2 whenever i play even a flash game or html5 online game the laptop restarts or shutdowns. 3 i was starting play firewatch today the laptop was on restart loop. i solved it using system restore. 4 AMD graphics in this laptop. Whenever I do any updates or any settings in this laptop the laptop gets lots of BSODs lots of problems. 5 BSODs when I multitask even while using twitter facebook in 2 tabs. LOL. is this what i bought an advanced laptop for? I won't lie my 10 year old PC does it better than this laptop in term of multitasking. yes it is slower than this but it outperforms this dell laptop in the BSODs case. 6 overheating even while just using facebook twitter for 1 hour. forget while gaming it is very much overheating while gaming restarts or shuts down. depends on this laptop's mood.
1,gpbp71,Dell,2,2020/05/24 12:10:36,Morning,Planning exchange HDD in G7 17 7790 Hi all Yesterday I ordered a G7 17 7990 directly from Dell. There was a sale in The Netherlands so I was able get a good deal on the i7-9750H the RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU The only thing I'm not super excited about is the 1TB HDD only 5400 rpm. I read online that it was relatively easy replace the HDD I also found instructions on how do it in the G7 17 maintenance manual on the Dell website . I was considering replacing it a SATA 2.5'' 1TB SSD Crucial MX500 it's 7mm so it should fit . I'm not too worried about physically replacing the hard drive although I would welcome any pointers since this will be the first time that I'm replacing components in a laptop instead of a desktop computer . I actually had a different concern/question the order I also got a 3-year plan for premium support the accidental damage service. I fully understand that any HDD/SDD I replace would not fall under the original warranty nor the Accidental Damage Service. However I was wondering I open up this laptop /or replace the HDD does that void the warranty /or Accidental Damage Service for the entire laptop? Or just the component that I'd replace? And does it matter the new SSD is not a Dell product since they don't exactly sell the cheapest SSDs ? Anyone any idea? Thanks..!

I opted for only the 512GB ssd on my order because I have a Samsung Evo Plus 1TB. What I do before setting up my laptop all my stuff is add my 1TB drive make it the primary Windows 10 then use the 512GB that came it as a secondary drive backup important files. Am I going run into any issues the following method? - take out the 512GB replace the 1TB - use the Dell RUSB yes I included it my order boot . I assume that is what this is for... reload the OS right? There wasn't a lot of information about this was but I don't have any spare USB drives laying around so I got it my order. - reinstall Windows 10 the RUSB - once OS is installed on the new drive I can add back my original 512GB drive format it I assume that would do it as long as I'm not misunderstanding what the DELL RUSB is they are sending my laptop. I also found out about the Dell OS Recovery Tool can download enter your id it creates an OS image for your specific laptop. This is the same thing as the RUSB right? I assume it doesn't matter where I place my drives in the laptop either right? This particular model can fit 4 ssd drives... the locations in the laptop should not matter at all right? Or is there possibly preferred spots due heat/cooling than others? Just looking for comments on this. I don't have my laptop yet still waiting for it be shipped but when it does come I don't run into any issues while doing this. Thanks for any info.

It's relatively normal outside of teamfights at about 120 but when teamfights happen it drops about 50 makes it impossible play. This had not been happening before.

If not I make a bad BIOS change that crashes how does one recover reverse the BIOS change?

1,gowl31,Dell,17,2020/05/23 17:56:42,Afternoon,Old Inspiron - I installed a new CPU now my PC hard freezes a few moments after booting the desktop. I installed a i5-4690k into my Dell inspiron replacing the Pentium G3240. The mobo is a 088DT1 an LGA 1150 socket. Everything seems be compatible. I've updated the bios the newest version A11 reset it default settings. At this point I'm afraid I bought a dud CPU. The only thing that seems like that isn't the case is that it doesn't freeze or crash when windows is booted safe mode. Does anyone have any advice? Any error messages I should look for?

1,gou9vr,Dell,1,2020/05/23 15:27:12,Afternoon,Who uses the application key on their computers? XPS 7590 Related  I use it heavily the application key the one that brings up the context menu because i'm pretty much only a keyboard typer. HOWEVER both my 7590 my cooler master Masterkeys Pro lack this feature standard the 7590 having the key accessible through right CTRL when the function keys are not swapped the media keys. I find this annoying but less egregious then my Masterkeys pro this is because not being lazy on a laptop doesn't have the same reach required right click a misspelled word that my desktop has. I simply move the mouse my thumb then right click they physical button all without moving my hands from the home row... I might have a pretty decent reach do this... So this brings me the core question here. Who actually uses the application key? dell were make a firmware update available that enables swap right ctrl the application key without swapping the media keys would use it? For those that are good at typing what do value in a keyboard on a laptop or otherwise? finally for those that have an XPS how does the typing experience compare other keyboards laptops have used?

1,goprd1,Dell,10,2020/05/23 11:13:28,Morning,Returned my Dell XPS 13 9300 1080P Was so hype about this product finally pulled the trigger. Opened it up started it after going through initial setup. Beautiful laptop tiny screen edges ir camera ...Run dell update app install latest software. The very first reboot caused BSOD reg Realtek sound driver I guess. rebooted ok sound works did not pay much attn. But...sound would all of the sudden stop working not muted volume maxed up nothing. Reboot brings back everything normal. Same thing BT just shuts itself my mouse or my iphone bt connection stops working. Figured it out that Power Management in BT driver should be ticked off not save power. Next thing is that I leave it idle screen opened no apps running it starts overheating so bad. And I mean that almost can't hold your hand bellow. Black screen but can still hear fans holding power off button for 20 sec or so would not shut it down. It happened several times after that. Another BSOD reg sound card follows up. I removed installed different driver as recommended from Dell. As soon as I thought ok sound is ok now another BSOD...so gave up. I am an IT guy 20 yrs of experience got sick tired spending time troubleshoot something that is like a week old. Sent it back. Very disappointed as I liked the hardware feel look. And when it works it is great device. -

Generally the performance isn't great. It frequently freezes when I am using Chrome 10-15 tabs Slack Zoom a VPN. My much older computer that I replaced this had significantly less freezing. Some problems I notice The meters in the task manager are wild All I have is Chrome open I it says I'm at 65% memory usage. If I manually count all of the tasks in this I only see roughly 2gb not 5gb! I see CPU spikes regularly 100% while doing not CPU intensive stuff browsing the internet Minecraft the only game I've dared play is very laggy at what I think are reasonable settings check out my screenshot see I'm right! Steps I've taken Paid close attention task manager see above Reformatted computer installed programs slowly see change was persistent Installed all the drivers the latest versions from the Dell site Paid attention it was getting very hot - it isn't really that warm when it's slow AF. x200B What steps can I take see what the problem is? Maybe it's a thermal paste issue? Any advice is greatly appreciated! Is there software I can use diagnose?

1,gonxfb,Dell,0,2020/05/23 09:39:54,Morning,Dell Inspiron 13' 7370 dead in a 1.5 years of use This was my first Dell Laptop I thought I'd purchase a mid-tier Ultrabook went the 7370 this was in January 2019. I was extremely happy the laptop wondered why I never chose go Dell sooner since I was always an HP guy but boy oh boy was I in for a ride. The hinges broke separated from under the display while I was opening the laptop I got it fixed. I thought it's alright perhaps this was just a one off. Well a month later suddenly the laptop is literally refusing start nor does it even register that it is charging the laptop has a light that indicates its charging well I was like perhaps the battery was disconnected but I was wrong I flip over the laptop open the base the battery is connected. I plug the charger in I suddenly notice that the laptop is heating up I realize that the onboard i5 8th gen is heating up without the laptop even being turned on i.e. the processor has shorted out. All of this insanity in a year of use my dads been using Dell laptops for over 15 years he has never seen this happen on any laptop within a year. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement I payed over 800 for this laptop now I'm left a god damn case. Replacing the motherboard will cost around 200 God knows how long that motherboard will last. The build quality at Dell is clearly not up standard I am left without a laptop in this pandemic. Honestly I really enjoyed the time I spent the laptop but I expect a laptop last at least 5 years of use not a year a half I've never had any laptop die on me my laptop from 2004 works like a charm. I'm really disappointed I would really appreciate anyone knows this is repairable in any way. I have babied the laptop ever since I bought it this is just really bad. Dead Inspiron

2,goi644,Dell,0,2020/05/23 04:08:57,Night,Keeping an MD1200 happy quiet  I bought an MD1200 - a 12 bay 3.5in direct attached storage device - the intention of using it hold disks for a freeNAS server. The MD1200 is attached an R720 rack server the freeNAS machine virtualised under VmWare. The two are connected using an LSI HBA PCI card which provides JBOD access the disks in the MD1200. FreeNAS doesn't like RAID controllers like the Dell Perc cards. So it works but the MD1200 is way noisy. I'm hoping someone can shed some light on this situation because I see three possibilities 1. MD1200 is just a noisy piece of gear 2. The MD1200 is upset because it's not hanging off a Perc card or 3. The MD1200 is upset because currently not all of its 12 bays are full. As things sit I'm not sure I can put up so much noise but it does seem me like the fans are all running at full - indicating a 'fault' of some nature. All status lights are happy power supply interface units front panel there's no console interrogate on the MD1200. I'm a bit stuck as how troubleshoot this I don't have access enough caddys fill every slot. I'd buy these I knew the MD1200 was a keeper but I don't buy more the gear ends up getting discarded. Thanks for any thoughts.

1,golshx,Dell,2,2020/05/23 07:49:27,Morning,Just found out my Dell laptop doesn't support G-Sync I bought a G-Sync monitor. Should I return? I'm very new buying high-performance gaming tech I believe I've made a mistake. I have a Dell G3 I3590 this one was shopping for an external monitor G-Sync as I have NVIDIA was looking maximize performance. I purchased this monitor after much searching but soon found out that the usb-c displayport alt-mode on my laptop runs through the default Intel GPU not the NVIDIA GPU. Therefore G-Sync will not work. this thread informed me I know I'll still get 144hz performance this monitor but I'm wondering it's worth the premium I paid for G-SYNC. Also the monitor's HDMI port only supports HDMI 1.4 capping at 60hz. This is relevant because I plan buy the next-gen Xbox in the winter since that supports HDMI 2.1 I think it can get up 120hz. Anyway I was searching for a long-term multi-use monitor take advantage of gaming high-refresh rates. And I'm having buyer's remorse. Help me.

Mainly because the fans have been throttling up lately I have never repasted the internals since I bought the machine more than 3 years ago! . I am sure the original thermal paste is flaking off as we speak. I found the following video that goes over the process However I have some follow-up questions 1. What is the best thermal paste purchase? I was thinking about getting the Noctua brand... 2. What app on Windows or Linux can I use do some before / after measurements on CPU Heat /or throttling? The video I linked shows an application being used but I can't see the name of the App. 3. Anything else I should do while I'm in there?

1,godgxt,Dell,0,2020/05/22 21:38:11,Evening,Is this normal - battery life? Hi i bought my laptop inspiron brand new around 16 months ago. For the past couple of months the battery has been dying after about an hour of use using best battery life status low brightness etc . while surfing the net using Microsoft word etc so not high intensity activities. More recently it says the battery is completely dead needs be replaced. Laptop will shutdown not plugged in. Laptop used essentially just for uni research/writing essays of course some Netflix. Is this normal or is there an issue the battery itself? I realise battery loses capacity time but I have never had one completely die within 16 months. I thought by this stage it would lose 30% capacity not 100%.

I’m currently saving up for the new upcoming XPS 17. I was wondering I bought the cheapest option let’s say 1500 8GB ram 256GB SSD GTX 1650 would it be possible upgrade the ram SSD myself? What other parts can I manually upgrade on this machine as well? Basically I just wanna know I buy the cheapest specs for XPS 17 can it be upgrade be more like the high end later on? I do motion design work on adobe after effects a bit of light 3D work on blender 3D don’t know this information helps 
2,go93ap,Dell,0,2020/05/22 16:39:30,Afternoon,Potential Mobile connect fixes So I've used a dell for about a month a half how. The best thing about the XPS that I have been using is the dell mobile connect. All of my friends have macs this is the closest I've come having the notification texting features that a mac does. The only issue that I have it is that the mobile control is through screen recording. As someone who texts friends through snapchat I'm often working on my laptop snapchatting at the same time. When I use the mobile control snapchat it says that I'm screen recording. My friend's don't mind but anytime I exit out of the app it sends a new notice the person. It would be great they could make the mobile control through a service other that screen sharing. Like maybe screen Mirroring. Overall I really enjoy the program my dell machine.

It's practically my dream laptop based on the reviews I'm seen on Youtube. However I unfortunately NEED a numpad for the work that I do. It's just way inconvenient not have it. So my question is is there a XPS 17 a numpad coming out or is it unlikely basically no chance?
1,goasat,Dell,2,2020/05/22 18:27:29,Afternoon,are there keyboard shortcuts for Dell Power Manager In general I like have it set charge between 70-80%. I had it set 50%-80% based on recommendations I had read but my problem is that even when I use it on battery I typically don't use it long enough get low enough for it charge. so I have use it for an extended period of time eventually there will come a time when It is stuck at 52% or something. then I'll be screwed. so I set it 70%-80%. Of course I set the power manager on my taskbar so I could change it but I have open the power manager click on settings etc. it's a slight ordeal. then I have remember go back into turn it off. What I'm curious is there's a keyboard shortcut that will either allow me switch between the battery settings. standard Express custom or else allow me turn on off charging. Right now my battery is at 72% plugged in . I could hit a keyboard shortcut that will switch it back forth from Plugged in Plugged in charging . that would work too. x200B edit I see the latitude had such a feature Fn F2 I guess I should specify I have an Inspiron 7590. Fn F2 for me is volume down. but maybe there's a similar less accessible but still available shortcut. edit nothing mentioned here...

No idea how long it has been like this but it based off other posts on the sub it might have been this way for a couple of months now. Very saddened not see Dell standing behind their product on this one. I mean either there's a defective part or maybe a second source being used at the factor or a design flaw. Not for an instant buying are supposed pick up put down a laptop when moving it on a table. I can say that I've slide my Surface Studio around 360 degrees or from person person a 28 monitor I would not call that mobile. Laptops are made be moved so pick up put down isn't going fly. When I contacted support they told me call paid support which sounds very expensive very futile based off what other people have been told so I thought I'd ask here What can I do repair this? Does anyone know how much it costs send it in? Is there a way order this FRU part so I can replace it myself? Thanks!

I would like get your opinions/thoughts on this I had an issue my Dell XPS 15 7590 in which the WIFI would disconnect every 5 minutes or so I would be unable reconnect for 30 seconds getting the message unable connect this network . I contacted Dell support after doing all the recommended driver stuff they sent someone out replace the wireless card. I got a day without any wifi issues but now it's back the original issue. I then read online that sometimes have set your wifi public this issue can arise so I changed private that bought me another disconnect free day but now I am back the same issue. Is this perhaps I problem my modem which has received no software update recently I haven't messed around the XPS was fine it for the previous 5 months ? I tried connecting another wifi network a TP link powerline extender so far I have had no disconnects. I am very confused by this. I Should add that no other device is experiencing this issue only my Dell XPS.

For the first following week I tried getting a return started through email received no response for a week. I then received an email saying that someone else had picked up my support ticket. He asked me I wanted process a return which I obviously said yes why ask again? . I've send him two more follow up emails but I still haven't received word from him. In the second following week I used chat support. The customer rep supposedly processed my return request said that I would receive an email confirmation a return label within the next 48 hours. Still haven't received anything. Today I tried contacting support through phone. After finally reaching someone after 45 minutes of waiting 2 redirects I got through someone was asked my order number. The rep said wait a few minutes while they go retrieve information. A few minutes later the call was disconnected. I'm actually very surprised at what's going on. I've been courteous patient but this is getting ridiculous. It'll be 30 days since my purchase in a few days I don't think I'm going be able get my return. Currently in line on the phone again. Hoping things go well this time.

1,go0lvz,Dell,15,2020/05/22 08:59:10,Morning,Mouse touchpad issues on XPS 7390 2 in 1. Just got my XPS 13 2 in 1. Build quality is good no coil whine but waiting on a screen change because of some hot pixels on the 4k display. The most annoying issue I'm coming across so far is my pointing devices. I connected my only wireless mouse a MS Surface Arc mouse via Bluetooth. If I leave the mouse stationary for any length of time it will not respond the next time I move it. It does register the movement though. After about 4-5 seconds the mouse will then jump where it was that I moved it. I went into the mouse power settings unchecked allow this computer turn off this device save power. When the cursour locks up the touch pad won't move the mouse either until the 4-5 seconds have passed. This also stores up the movement data moves the cursor the amout that it moved while locked up. One other pointer issue I'm coming across is that the touchpad stops responding when multiple keys are pressed. I play some low power games from time time such as Half Life 2 but the mouse is currently useless the locking up issue I use the touchpad it won't respond while keys like w s are held at the same time. Any ideas?

Even the XPS 17 will obviously be a better machine it is heavier than what I would like wouldn’t fit in most of the bags I use regularly. While waiting for the 8-core processor when can we reasonably expect detailed review of the new XPS 15 no LaptopMag doesn’t count ? I would be mostly interested in battery noise tests hoping that the revised cooling system is good enough.

I am mainly just looking for a computer do school work basic office apps web surfing watching videos etc MAYBE playing some games but that is not a requirement. Any opinions?

But recently my PC died so I have been using my xps as my main device while working from home its great. However last night after work my friends I wanted play some DnD we did a video chat on discord for a couple of hours my laptop got so insanely hot I couldn't even touch it. I know this shouldn't be happening a laptop of this caliber only a few years old right? I keep the laptop clean of bloatware always update everything make sure it lives as long as it can. Anyone know what I can do fix this? We will be playing again next week I'm afraid its frying the insides of my laptop.. Thanks!

I am of the philosophy that I am going spend a large amount of money on technology I good warranty support. I don't agree spending 4000 dollars on a laptop but it only has a 3 year warranty i.e. MBP 16 or Razer Blade Studio . That seems insane spend that much money for such little support time. What I really like about Dell is that the precision line can give me 5 year Pro-support desired. I do not mind spending an additional 400-500 bucks for 5 years of support anything breaks down. Even the XPS goes up 4 years which is much better than 3 years. I like keep the same laptop between 5-6 years it has worked out well in the past. I would like know other people's experience Dell support 4 years or more . Was it worth it? Did they fix your issues in a timely manner. Did have pay anything extra for replacements? How was your experience longevity?

Suddenly stopped working last month i couldn’t find anything burnt on the motherboard but I ended up ordering a refurbished one since dell said my laptop is out of warranty. I replaced the motherboard. It worked fine...for a month. Left it unplugged screen folded. Came home edit a video doesn’t turn on no matter what. No charging light nothing. This is ridiculous dell customer support sucks. How am I going buy a several hundred dollar laptop just for it stop working less than a year a half later? And then be told pay for service when dell is manufacturing defective parts.

A friend bought me a replacement fan as a gift it seemed exactly the same but when I went install it I realized that the connectors are very slightly different. This is a side-by-side of the old broken fan the new one. Since both are 4-pin connectors have the same-color coding I presume there is no real pin difference just different housing. Is this true it is do adapters exist between the two? The laptop model is the Dell G5 5590 w/ RTX 2060.

5,gnl42v,Dell,4,2020/05/21 15:01:01,Afternoon,Questions about Dell XPS 15 2019  Hi everyone. I am looking forward purchase an XPS 15 2019 model but there are a few things that I would like ask first. Keep in mind that I am interested in the very basic configuration the cheapest one . So 1. I know that the 2017 model had some issues the keyboard. At the time some users said there was a problem in some keys that would not respond while fast-typing on the computer always had double check what they were writing in order avoid spelling mistakes. I wonder the 2019 model of the XPS 15 has that problem too...or has Dell fixed it? How would rate your keyboard? 2. Does the cheapest configuration have the 6 cells 97Wh battery? Or does it have a smaller battery like the cheapest config of the 2020 model 56Wh compared the 86Wh for the rest of the configurations ? 3. Have noticed any burn-in effect in the display since purchased it? 4. What components are soldered into the motherboard? I heard few of them are actually not replaceable. This could actually be a problem one wants upgrade certains things. For instance replacing the killer wireless card or the ssd add storage capacity etc... Any help is appreciated.

Will the regular XPS touchscreen be sufficiently precise/sensitive for this? I do not otherwise need the precise control of a pen hesitate get the 2 in 1 just for some simple drawings. I also really like the sound of the 4k display but am also open getting the 1080p touchscreen battery life is significantly worse. Does anyone have any numbers for the 4k version?

The hinge on my 4-year-old XPS 13 has been giving me trouble for several months the whole thing finally kind of came apart catastrophically. I decided I'd like try remove the screen completely use the body through my TV. After doing this the computer will boot I'll get an image through USBC/HDMI but no matter what the computer shuts off after 35 seconds. Doesn't matter I'm in BIOS or have managed do everything fast enough be loading the OS by then. I've tried without the WIFI card the battery. The one thing that isn't intact aside of course from the monitor camera wifi cables being disconnected is that I couldn't disconnect the card reader power which is tightly attached the screen power cable ended up breaking the cable trying. So the cable's head is still plugged into the motherboad near the card reader but there's no cable coming out of it. Could that be my issue? Any other ideas for things try? Would be nice not have completely bricked it...

I use ThrottleStop on Windows intel-undervolt on Linux undervolt the CPU the iGPU but they were not working at all. Simply rolling back the firmware version 1.13.1 did not help so I upgraded it again tried the Factory reset trick in the BIOS Restore settings button . Afterwards undervolting re-started working again. I could confirm it only on Linux using intel-undervolt read because ThrottleStop on Windows isn't giving me correct readings anymore nevertheless the laptop is running cool again . Update ThrottleStop 8.70 works fine 8.74 doesn't. I'm disabling automatic firmware updates UEFI capsule updates in the BIOS for now.

1,gnndo8,Dell,0,2020/05/21 17:17:23,Afternoon,Dell g7 17' 7790 2060 Going into sleep mode while gaming due overheating ?  Hi everyone I bought this dell g7 laptop secondhand a while ago im pretty happy it at the moment but i am running into a persistent issue. I flashed the gpu bios a different one a higher tdp 80w 90w but the gpu cpu are cooled using thermal grizzly conductonaut liquid metal so the cpu temps never hit 80c while gaming the gpu hovers around 75c or so. The issue I've had though is even these relatively low temperatures the computer goes into sleep mode while playing games. I use an external monitor which says loading for a split second before turning off then the laptop itself seems turn off but I hit the power button it starts up again the same apps still running so I assume its going into sleep mode. I have hwinfo64 monitor temperatures but is there maybe some sensor im missing or not aware of thats causing the computer go into sleep mode. I wonder it could also be due having flashed a different bios on the laptop gpu a higher tdp.. but at the same time my temperatures are pretty low. I did notice though that the conductors on the cpu gpu the whole green area besides the chip itself seemed be covered in this black tape which might be insulating heat somehow but it doesnt reflect in the temperatures in HWINFO64. x200B If anyone has any advice ty ahead of time.

1,gnk34u,Dell,10,2020/05/21 13:42:37,Afternoon,9570 Power Limit Throttling during low load I've a XPS 9570 that is power throttling quite often. It's especially noticable when using medium heavy Adobe- CAD-programs I expereince drops down 800MHz . Even opening a browser makes it go down 800. The throttling is happening even though the temperature is low the TDP is around 15-20W so I guess this doesn't have anything do temperature. The fans are rarely spinning anyways which I find strange during heavy load. I've also undervolted -0 100V without any effect on the throttling. As can see in the screenshots it's power throttling some in idle not great not terrible throttling a lot during stress test. I thought throttling only happened either when the temperature is high or when the computer is running on battery? I've the computer connected a TD19 180W docking but that shouldn't make any difference? Idle stats Load stats

1,gni5ad,Dell,2,2020/05/21 11:33:00,Morning,XPS 15 9575 GPU Problems Hey all I have been having some issue the past 2-3 weeks my XPS's performance when playing video games. I don't play video games much but enjoy doing so occasionally. I mostly use my laptop for work. I have had it for about 3 years now. I usually play CS GO or SC2 both on relatively medium settings 1920x1080 resolution on a 32' 4k monitor fullscreen. I have the dedicated Radeon Vega card set utilize during gaming. I have never had any issues gaming. Recently though I have been encountering pretty hard stuttering during my gaming sessions which last 1-2.5 hours . I will boot up one of the two games it will work fine for maybe 10-15 minutes then it will start stuttering hard sometimes experiencing 1-2 minutes of smooth gameplay before stuttering again. I have some suspicions but am not entirely sure what could be causing this. At first I thought it was an internet issue given the notoriety my past issues the Killer card but everything runs fine smooth when streaming Youtube or other video/surfing the web. Also when working using a low-intensity platform that still requires a constant fast server connection I have no issue. It is only games so I don't think it is fundamentally an internet issue though I could be wrong. Speedtests give a consistent 150-200ish download. Though my ping in-game for CSGO always floats at about 40. In the past 2-3 weeks two big things have happened. 1 I have had several system updates from Dell for Windows 10 2 Summer weather 80 degrees has set in where I live. So I think it may be either an issue caused by the updates messing the drivers/cards or overheating. Attached are 3 images. The first image is of the Task Manager when the stuttering is occurring during gaming. As can see there are these weird spikes where the Dedicated Radeon GPU stops functioning being taken over by the Integrated Intel card which presumably cannot handle the workload. Also this weird thing happens the Wifi I don't know how interpret it. Could the processing of internet signal be the cause/effect of graphical overload? The second image is when the stuttering stops the game runs smoothly for a couple minutes. As can see the Radeon GPU returns a regularly functioning level the Intel takes a backseat the Wifi remains at a steady 300-ish. The third image is right when I boot the game up CSGO it is running smoothly. Wifi is smooth the Intel is at a smooth 20% the Radeon GPU is fully functioning the dip at the end is just because I stopped moving my in-game character take the screenshot not an anomoly . I do find it off that in order run a small windowed CSGO which I did just take these screenshots the Radeon card is running at 100% but that may be normal for all I know. The game wasn't stuttering during that period so it may be fine. Please let me know anyone is having this problem or knows why this is happening. This is frustrating my knowledge of computers is not quite sufficient really know what is going on here or my internet is involved. I suspect it may be overheating because it does indeed get quite hot the game runs smoothly the longest when I first boot it up indicating the computer is fine until it eventually heats up plus the warmer weather in the past couple weeks. Thank for the help! x200B Image 1 In-Game during stuttering x200B Image 2 In-Game when running smooth in between stuttering period Image 3 Right after I boot up start playing smooth performance

What I wonder is There are 4 SAS Connectors on the mainboard listed here as 14 15 16 17 According he first link all 4 ports get are used in the 10x2.5 configuration but in my configuration 8x2.5 they're all fee. I'd like extend stoage by connecting an external backplane 4 SAS/SATA drives backplane has a mini-sas connecto . My question is - can I use one of these 4 SAS connectors? are these connectors controlled by the H730? How many external backplanes disks per backplane could I connect hat way without installing a different RAID/HBA controller? Here's a bigger picture of the configuration I have except for the second backplane in the back the two drives there. I don't have those

My XPS 15 7590 runs hot only when it’s plugged in original dell charger . If no tasks are performed the left side right by the charger ranges from warm very hot. If tasks are performed not necessarily heavy tasks e.g. updating a software downloading a video almost anything temps peak at 98C easily. Absolutely no problem when it runs on battery it doesn’t get over 70 on heavy tasks. What am I missing? What’s the problem? It’s not undervolted nor repasted. Edit for reference while I was updating a game i noticed the cores were at 85C the moment I unplugged it it instantly went 60C.

I've made no hardware changes just a clean install of Windows from Microsoft Recovery Media. I ran Windows Update SupportAssistant update all drivers both confirm no updates are available after a reboot. In the windows store when I go Dell Mobile Connect it displays a message This app is not compatible this device . In this thread I see that DELL support said me that I need reinstall Windows their Windows 10 brand image . For us this is out of question because of company policy due government requirements. Has Dell support changed their view on this ludicrous policy? What is the bug that prevents the store from recognizing actual Dell hardware?

The XPS 15 has always been a solid laptop a few problems one of which being the Killer wifi card. On the past few models we have been able replace this card for the far better intel variant. But now Dell has permanently adhered the card the motherboard looking at Dave's pictures which makes the switch intel cards no longer a viable option. x200B Do guys think that the new 9500 will still have these wifi problems? Would replacing the killer drivers intel ones help? x200B Just asking before I pour money into a laptop that might cause a lot of problems

3,gn46gp,Dell,5,2020/05/20 19:54:30,Evening,Dell XPS 19360 - Quality?? Is it just me but Dell's quality has gone down hill! I bought the Dell XPS 19360 i7 8th Gen 16gb Ram 512GB SSD. The laptop is 2.4 years old. I now have a number of problems Keyboard button Z no longer works without smashing it! I haven't dropped anything on it this happened just after the one year. Charging Port has failed - No longer charges seems like the port has failed. I have resorted using the USB C port for charging. Battery - The battery health is pretty terrible too. 40% the battery will just train 0 within a few minutes. The original charger blew up - I expect this was a power problem at the hotel but still. I went from a Macbook Pro this Dell typically I kept Apple laptops for at least 4 years but I don't think this Dell laptop will even make it 3 years never mind 4 years. Have guys experienced the same? Do think I should upgrade? - I like the look of the new XPS 15 but my trust in Dell is lacking. Or switch back Apple. The only thing Dell has going for it is that they seem go on Sale every year. So replacing a Dell every 2 or so years at 1800 what I paid for this one would still work out cheaper than buy a top end macbook for 4 years. When is the cost of dealing these problems too much? justifiable change.

1,gn7lcf,Dell,4,2020/05/21 00:30:23,Night,XPS 13 7390 2-in-1 connected standby / battery drain Connected standby is consuming too much battery when the machine is turned off completely. How am I sure the machine was off? In the Windows task manager in the tab performance the up time resets 0 after turning it on. My previous XPS 13 7390 2-in-1 was replaced in the past because the battery drained too much at night technical support couldn't solve this problem. My current XPS is draining 15% battery capacity each night on average. I didn't change the battery settings kept them default. I use powercfg /batteryreport in CMD. After shutting down in the evenings or nights the system keeps draining the battery. When turning it on in the morning which is usually 8-12 hours later the machine lost 5000-10000 mWh. There's no difference the lid is closed or open. Or the charging cable or thunderbolt cable for WD19TB is connected or not. This battery drain is too much. The design capacity of the battery is 49 985 mWh right now mine charges up 46 178 mWh after a few months. This additional battery drainage due connected standby is a problem for me I the machine drain less or no battery when it’s turned off.

From the beginning it was a bit loud but the laptop is great but it's been driving me crazy because of how loud hot it gets. The configuration I got was i7-8750H 16GB ram full HD screen. The laptop gets hot even when CPU usage is less than 15% memory usage is around 50%. I don't have much experience softwares like Throttlestop. I only use Dell Power Manager keep it on quiet because I find it works best for me. Cool doesn't actually keep it cool but it makes it louder. I'm sure many of are facing the exact same problem so how did fix it?

1,gn6xc1,Dell,0,2020/05/20 23:32:56,Evening,How install CABC fix for 9350? I have a 9350 on the way I've been reading about how some people have bricked their display panels by trying install this fix or the installer has just failed for them so I find out the best way do it properly. Does it matter which Intel video driver version I have installed? I saw in another thread that someone had issues installing the CABC fix until they downgraded their driver or something. Is it common get a SHP1420 panel older 9343 panel model the 9350? Apparently it's impossible install the fix on this model as the firmware chip on the display panel itself is locked on this panel model cannot be written . According reviews the 9350 is supposed come a SHP1449 or SHP145x but someone else on this sub had a 9350 the SHP1420. Does the 9350 have CABC by default when plugged in or only on battery?

16,gmp6vs,Dell,41,2020/05/20 06:05:13,Night,Was bored -- My predictions for the new Dell XPS 15 17 reviews Trigger Warning don't hate me too much  Design Everyone are gonna praise the design. It looks aesthetically great stronger than before. There will be a divide between people saying they should have went all aluminum or keeping the ‘carbon fibre’. People will find issues the obsession reduce thickness. Moreover people will have note that these laptops are thicker than claimed due the raised rubber feet. People will be annoyed the fact that they made the XPS 15 smaller leading it perform only 10% better than the previous XPS 15 all the intention get people spend more on the “real” upgrade the XPS 17. People will find QC defects that are unexpected reminding them this is still not Apple. Some people are not gonna like the fact that the palm rest trackpad are fingerprint magnets. The coating on the trackpad will be worn off after a few months OR it'll be impossible remove the remaining grease. x200B Ports People will be disappointed the ports on the XPS 15. Again intentionally made smaller provide a lesser experience. People will praise Dell for embracing the future proof thunderbolt 3 ports in general. It will take people a little bit of testing understand that the thunderbolt 3 controllers are limited somehow in their operation. For example when plugging in 4 usb c cables in the XPS 17 the performance will suffer somehow. People will start pointing out that sd card readers are not enough. They exclude XQD CF Express cards. These are a waste of motherboard space considering the embracement of thunderbolt 3. This will probably never happen because the YouTube bubble usually uses the same camera gear all of which use sd cards . x200B Display People will LOVE the displays. As usual the 1080p screen will be great. The 4k screen will be amazing. People will not like the fact that they can’t see a part of their 16 10 screens when they type. Their fingers will cover a portion of the lower display. People will complain about some kind of backed in battery saving options such as auto brightness that can’t be fully turned off for some reason. x200B Battery People will take issue the battery life on both machines. On paper they’ll look very promising. In reality both will get slightly lower battery life or the same but not better. Again the obsession reducing thickness combined the fact that can’t put more than 100w battery inside means slightly worse battery life unless windows 10 the new components are much more power efficient all of a sudden . For some mysterious reason the batteries in these machines will degrade much quicker than the competition. No one will know why people will talk about it only in forums. x200B Thermals The XPS 17 will perform great. People will forget we’re talking about RTX 2060 or lower. Since Dell under delivered for 4 years straight people will praise them very much for improving the same design they insisted on for years. People will still re-paste the thermal solution in their XPS. There will be zero discussion on why a manufacturer is unable apply proper thermal paste. x200B Other Speakers will be better but always behind the competition. The speaker grills will be full of dust dirt very quickly. People will realize that only a few companies can pull this off perfectly. The keyboard will have limited options for backlight levels. The keyboard will have backlight bleed. The trackpad is be praised very much. People will also find out that the trackpad is too big palm rejection needs work. People will notice that in some units the trackpad is either too lose or not sitting flush the palm rest.

Different hard drives different purposes. Specs here The 500Gb hard drive running openSUSE is used edit pictures personal e-mail reading how set up break a raspberry pi browse reddit. The second 500Gb hard drive running windows is used for work. The options I had by mid-March 2020 -when it all started- were 1. Install windows use my equipment work. 2. Bring home a company PC that I don't make room for assume any damage it. With a little effort I might have been able use a virtual windows machine for work woulda coulda shoulda but Citrix is a bitch the company's VPN is a cunt I am not that smart. What I opted for was install windows on a second hard drive that is how I've been living my life ever since. Windows from 7h 15h on disk A openSUSE from 18h 22h on disk B. The use abuse on this Dell is showing. I have noticed especially while using windows that programs now take 3 or 5 seconds launch when it used be just 1. After some reading asking around I now know that my searches should be based on Optiplex 7010 compatible not Linux compatible not Windows compatible. Someone in the Dell forum solved a similar issue this part but it was discontinued 3 years ago. Page 13 of the optiplex 7010 technical guidebook from 2012 mentions a minimum of 2GB a maximum of 16GB paired memory modules so I won't be doing 32x2 not that I need that either but the document is 8 years old. YES the machine is old. NO my life does not depend on it so buying a new PC is not a priority. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Maybe can recommend a reliable site purchase 7010 compatible cards Thank

Is there a docking station that is compatible both? I typically have external peripherals including a monitor plugged directly into my personal laptop. I use it more as a desktop the added bonus of being able take it me needed. With working from home for the last few months I'd love be able just swap out the laptops leave the rest intact. It seems a docking station would accomplish this nicely one existed that could fit them both. Does such a beast exist? I can provide more details on the two machines in question needed.

1,gmum6z,Dell,3,2020/05/20 10:48:16,Morning,Will Dell let me use the Accidental Damage policy I just bought after damage occured? I have a six month old XPS 13. My 5th one in 10 years. They've been great. Tripped on the stairs at home while carrying it open slippery socks threw it down the stairs as I caught myself. Aluminum case is majorly bent. As a testament the build quality the laptop is working fine I'm using it right now . Unfortunately a corner of the screen is cracked leaking LCD in the corner. Screen at least needs be replaced. I logged into Dell support enter a ticket when I realized I don't have Accidental Coverage. Whoops. However when I logged in they offered me extend the On-Site Support policy I have a 25% discount I was able add Accidental Coverage. I tried see the policy see the damage would be excluded couldn't find anything clear so I purchased. Surprised they let me do it. Then I called them was told since I just bought Accidental Coverage I had wait 30 days enter a claim. Bummer but I can understand. I also tried Twitter. Same result. I can deal the time but what will stink is when the 30 days is up they deny it as preexisting damage which now that I have the full policy is pretty clear. However the twitter person said never fear they would get me going after 30 days. The Twitter operator fully aware of the situation replied I assure that we shall get this fixed. However I fear my honesty will get my future claim denied outright. What do think will happen? Such a bummer as I am a fanboy evangelist for Dell the decision maker at work. I usually buy Complete Care/Accidental Damage but in this case I just screwed up. Never made a claim in over 10 years them for damage like this. I really need the computer as I am partially furloughed from my job have nothing else.

1,gmt9uy,Dell,6,2020/05/20 09:39:20,Morning,XPS 15 is Turning into a Brick Please Help Me TLDR My XPS runs extremely hot idling at 60-65 deg C I have no idea why. x200B My XPS 15 has had problems since day one I'm being honest but in the past couple months I've been having a major thermal throttling issue. I can no longer even run CSGO a consistent 60 frames due thermal throttling lowering my fps. Mind when I say thermal throttling I don't mean throttling at like 80 degrees C I mean it shoots all the way up 96 degrees then throttles like it just hit the depths of hell is attempting come back up the surface. I would not recommend this laptop anyone - my two friends the same model have also gone through constant struggles keep theirs running properly. I digress. x200B I used XTU for awhile undervolt then I went throttlestop then I went back XTU then I went throttlestop again that's where I''m at now. I have CPU core cache at a safe it can go higher 120mv undervolt the iGPU at -65mv. Not much else is changed in there aside from the Speedshift setting which I have set at 80 prefer performance over battery since it's plugged in 90% of the time I have a battery profile for when it's on battery . I also use MSI afterburner for the nvidia GPU when running games however that seems do absolutely nothing on my machine - my friends have had success it. x200B I am going be repasting the thermal paste in the next couple days as well as adding some thermal pads hopefully that will help but I know for certain that there is something else going on here regarding software that I can't figure out. Something is seriously wrong what I have - it should not be running this hot. My one friend the exact same build of the laptop as me gets 15-20 degrees C cooler than me on any task I've replicated his settings several times. I'm really at a loss. x200B Should I fresh install Windows again ? Would that help at all? Could it help? Any software recommendations? Power plan setting recommendations? x200B Thanks in advance y'all.

At some point in time documents started having a red x next them or saying sync pending. I then noticed I had a red x next OneDrive which I never have used at least not intentionally. So I uninstalled onedrive from my computer so that my documents would stop trying sync. It worked for a while but now today documents are not opening even Microsoft word is not opening. Any ideas on what do? When I search this up the only help that shows up is for File Explorer not opening which is not my issue.
43,gm9shn,Dell,40,2020/05/19 12:44:08,Morning,Awful Customer Support Just wanted come here vent as I am shocked by how unhelpful Dell customer service has been for me. I have a XPS 15 9570 a few weeks ago I started getting the AC adapter isn't recognized error which at the time was annoying but whatever I looked into replacing the charging port myself although I decided ship it in as I thought I would surely screw something up in my computer I were try replace it myself. So after a week I finally received my laptop back from Dell good news right? Nope. Somehow they bricked my computer now I get the error that my hard drive is Not Installed . So now I have send it back in the repair center fix an issue that could've been identified ANYONE at the repair center would've simply tried turn on my computer as the error I am getting now prevents me from booting up my computer. As someone who is a Student currently in virtual class along an internship starting next week I need my computer more or less everyday was struggling during the time that my computer was in repair. I am not sure what this will accomplish but it fucking pisses me off that I spent 120 dollars repair my computer because I was worried about fixing it myself for 10 dollars when Dell made it worse than I would have I tried do this myself. I've spent hours on hours customer support only be treated like I don't know what I am doing or left on hold for god knows how long. I do love my laptop when it is functional but this is ridiculous me it's even more ridiculous that this appears be a COMMON issue for others dealing Dell's terrible support. DellCares I hope see this!

I get frequent crackling/popping sounds when playing audio my wired mouse keyboard randomly hang-up programs will lag when dragging between dual monitors I get massive frame rate drops occasionally. CPU Intel Core i7-8750H 8th gen The power plan is set Balanced laptop sits on cooling pad minimal programs run in the background. Laptop settings are mostly kept at the default settings. Regardless I'm playing Call of Duty or only typing a Word doc the CPU clock speed is always jumping between screaming fast super slow even when the CPU usage is very low CPU usage is 4% in graph below . All the other measurements below check out but I can't figure out why the CPU is erratically throttling like it is without the presence of high CPU temperatures.

1,gmrjih,Dell,2,2020/05/20 08:10:40,Morning,My XPS 15 9560 is having some very annoying issues... So I've had my XPS 15 9560 for about 2 years now. Since I've had a lot more free time I've been gaming on it a lot more than usual. The main titles I play are games like Minecraft League of Legends or Skyrim which actually runs great . A few weeks ago I started playing Minecraft again it has been quite a fun experience until I started getting these very annoying FPS drops in game. The game runs smoothly for a little while on about 50-60 FPS then this issue just hits seemingly randomly out of nowhere the FPS drops dramatically down about 0-1 FPS basically unplayable. I first assumed it was just a server issue or internet connectivity problems but as soon as I fully close down Minecraft that laggyness spikes of extreme slowness still persist make my system pretty much unusable. So far the only fix was just calmly take a deep breath restart my laptop then generally things would go back normal I could play again until of course the problem comes back . Now after not having played Minecraft for a week or so I've been playing League of Legends. Same problem! Not only that I get these bouts of laggyness my mouse for example just jitters around not being smooth at all. So I tried find some solutions. What I've done so far was change Dell's Power Settings Ultra Mode update drivers reinstall drivers give my Nvidia Graphics card priority graphic settings... Still not working after all this. I'm starting think it might be a hardware issue? I love my machine hope I can use it for a lot longer it was hefty purchase afterall So I would massively appreciate any help at all this issue. Please also don't hesitate ask for more information or system screenshots or whatever it takes fix my baby for me be able just simply play a game of League or Minecraft every once in a while. Again thanks for taking the time read all of that! Much love! Stay safe out there!
41,gm8m1n,Dell,34,2020/05/19 11:45:12,Morning,1 week the Dell XPS 9300 Just wanted do a simple straight forward review of this laptop. My model has the base i5 1035G1 16gb of RAM the 1080p matte finish display 256gb of storage. Build quality If Macbooks have a 10/10 on build quality this laptop has an 8.5. I would give it a 9 but my machine has a few build issues the screen up the front left corner of the laptop doesn't lay flat a bit of light leakage on the bottom left corner of the screen . It feels very solid premium but just a cut below a MBP. Screen Pretty good screen can't complain. Matte works well for me can get rather bright. Where my previous mid-range laptops have left me wanting more this screen delivers. CPU I just code so I haven't pushed it very hard but this thing runs well over the advertised 1ghz on all battery settings. I'm also running an external monitor through the laptop the fans only come on when I'm charging my laptop so it seems handle simple tasks total ease. Other stuff Fans don't get loud loud for gaming definitely upgrade the CPU the Irus Plus graphics 60fps in LoL but not smooth the keyboard is AWESOME super light 16 by 10 monitor ratio is super nice around 10 hours of battery life for me so far that's it. Good machine will be testing out an EGPU GTX 970 soon!

2,gmmuth,Dell,12,2020/05/20 03:37:07,Night,Cancel XPS 15 9500 pre-order? Hi guys I have been looking for a while replace my 13 inch MacBook Pro 2014. I was looking at the XPS 13 for a while but was also waiting see what the new xps 15 would look like. When it was released last week I loved the new design specs etc. I ordered it the next day through the Netherlands store the i7 dedicated graphics 16gb ram 1tb storage UHD display 10% student discount for 2339 euro's 2599 original price . Although I understand the XPS 15 is not a gaming laptop I like how it still would allow me occasionally play some other total war games maybe GTA 5 Im not a hardcore gamer which would be fine for me. For some reason I also got 5 year accidental damage protection for free so I just had order it. However the more I read about the new XPS 15 how amazing it is the more ridiculous the prices compared are last years model getting close MBP 16's price makes me in doubt of cancelling it order the XPS 13 instead. Saving me 600 euro's but costing me gaming ability performance the bigger display. Can anyone help me make up my mind is it worth the additional 600 euro's investment? I use the device primarily for college but the ability game is a big perk me. x200B Thanks! I get its a little confusing but I just can't make up my mind PS i wanna switch windows due apples outrageous prices especially for repairs I don't wanna get stuck in the apple ecosytem.

I have a new XPS 13 7390 although everything works fine when my laptop is powered by the WD19TB dock it produces nasty coil whine when I'm doing things such as scrolling on a website. It only happens when the laptop is powered by the dock. If I power the laptop by the standard charger there is no coil whine. I guess the dock gives slightly different power the laptop which it doesn't like. Having a way disable power from the WD19TB would be great. Not sure this is possible? I do not mind having both my normal power cable plugged into the laptop as well as my WD19TB dock.
1,gmq8fx,Dell,1,2020/05/20 07:02:56,Morning,Dell XPS 13 9370 thunderbolt port issues Hello all I have a Dell XPS 13 9370 from work that I am currently using work from home. Here I have a Dell U2719DC monitor that I can directly connect using a single USB-C cable the laptop. This cable provides charge image enables the USB-A ports from the monitor where I usually have a headset a keyboard plugged in. For the past couple of months I have noticed that I touch this cable even in the slightest the peripherals plugged into the monitor will momentarily disconnect but the image continues working . Some days the monitor is not recognized at all in one of the ports I have use the other one. But then the next day works again which is very confusing. I have tested the monitor cable my personal laptop Macbook Pro no matter how rude I am the cable the image connected peripherals remain stable. After testing this I contacted Dell because the laptop is still within warranty period. We ran the diagnostics utility which reported one error. They sent a technician swap the motherboard which should fix the problem. And it did. But only for a day. Now I've been having the same issues again for a week. Only difference is that now the diagnosis does not report any error. Today I called them again report that the repair was not successful. His suggestion is buy another USB-C cable test it which honestly I don't feel like doing or send the laptop their lab which can take up two weeks. Obviously I need the computer work I would have extract all of the confidential information from the hard drive which is also a hassle. That would guys suggest? Buy another cable? Send the laptop? Is there another option that we are missing? Thanks in advance! let me know some additional information

Generally speaking the WD19TB works fine the connection my screen Dell Ultrasharp 27 is stable everything works as intended. Until the moment I plug in a device my laptop or the docking station itself. It can be anything from my iPhone an external hard drive as soon as I plug it in the USB ports the Ethernet port on the dock go dark. The monitor connection stays stable though. Only after I reboot the computer is everything fine again. Though when I unplug the aforementioned device same thing happens I need reboot again. I installed all the updates from the WD19TB product page but this didn't resolve this problem. While googling around I found some similar threads about Dell laptops running Ubuntu which weren't really helpful for me. Anyone got an idea here? Or anyone know how contact Dell support about this via email or chat? Thanks!

0,gmmuzi,Dell,12,2020/05/20 03:37:25,Night,Why are XPS still that far behind... Hi there currently my daily driver is a MBP 13 2017 TouchBar. And I try get out of the Apple ecosystem since the last 6 years but had no success. Today I tested the XPS 13 9300. It's a somewhat fine machine but some points are still really bothering. - The speakers are incredeibly bad. No highes everything sound like under a blanket they are just embarrasing - The trackpad is sadly still garbage 're used a Mac. For example can't easily click on the top edge I always do it when I write 10 fingers... - Coil whine.... No words for that the electronics speak it's crazy - Fan curve is way hectic it feels like it has only 3 modes off medium fullblown. Why can't DELL regulate the fans without steps like a Mac? I really don't get it... - The keyboard feels really mushy too soft thats coming from a shitty Butterfly keyboard user - The silicone finish is a real turnoff please stop calling it carbon fiber we all know it's just carbon fiber optics in reality it's just plain old silicone On the other hand the display is damn epic finally 16 10!!!! The general size is neat I really switch another laptop but espacially the really bad speakers are hindering me...
1,gmmig1,Dell,0,2020/05/20 03:11:33,Night,Help for Inspiron 7591 CPU performance capped at 33% on battery I purchased Inspiron 7591 8GB model i5 9300H I live in India purchased from a local authorized dealer not from website tho he claimed that he will order from the website I can collect from his store. Info-Primary Battery More Info 56WHr Integrated When I'm on wall power or AC power basically plugged in then I get 100% CPU performance in the stress test. When I plug out then performance drops 33% stays there until I plug the power in back again after which it will achieve full performance. I don't think it's because of thermal throttling as even I start the test on battery power when the CPU is cool still it can't go above 33%. This can be seen in the video all the power plans are set ultra-performance etc along fan speed as well. I was told that this could be because I have 56 Whr battery so is anyone else here who has the same kinda battery experiencing the same issue?

Apart from it being a beast an amazing screen I am having some I believe graphics issues that I haven't been able resolve. When Alt-Tabbing sometimes it happens that the screen stutters. In some cases I have seen a frozen screen audio still works needed a hard reset. In most cases work continues normally after a stutter of 5 secs. When this happens I am receiving a Windows / Hardware Error in the Windows 10 Reliability Monitor. My guess is that Intel Iris drivers provoke this error happen. I have Dell Command Update installed have already performed an Advanced Driver Restore. I have also installed the newest stable Intel Iris drivers downloaded directly from Intel. I have tried disabling Panel Self Refresh in the Intel Command Center no avail. What would recommend trying next? Anyone similar issues? Thanks all best.

There's this weird issue I've had recently my Dell laptop where my laptop would every now then have the fans fail respond correctly showing Error code 2000-0712. The online fix I've been following is just restarting the laptop which appears fix the problem. However this keeps happening so I might suspect something might be slightly damaged. I'd prefer fix this on my own at all possible so I need provide more details about the issue I would be happy . Does anyone know why this is happening what I can do about it?

In March 2020 I started use the webcam due the coronavirus. I noticed that when I turn on my webcam the picture shows numerous flickering purple bars which worsens in low light. I had a video call several times everyone commented on my crummy picture video they suggested I use a different computer. I discussed the issue Microsoft Windows support today we verified I have the latest Windows 10 Version 1909 software bios drivers. The flickering horizontal purple bars issue persists. I spoke a Dell technician Angad tonight he thinks it is a hardware issue now ie. loose connection the camera ? He would not do further testing because I am out of warranty buy a month? I purchased the laptop from a Microsoft store they are closed due the coronavirus I need get this resolved ASAP. I did purchased a 4 year extended warranty from Microsoft but this appears be a Dell issue. Thank .

I didn't realize how bad the problem was until I downloaded HWMonitor saw my CPU was consistently between 85-100C minimal usage - I'm not a gamer or programmer. It stayed in that range when all applications were closed. This also explains the random slowness/lag while doing basic work. I consistently close background processes have fully updated my BIOS drivers the latest being 2 days ago kept my laptop's vents open on a flat surface etc. This seems be a design flaw I'm wondering what this means for my computer's longevity.

Firstly the laptop will mostly be for personal use watching movies web browsing travel some gaming not much any . I'll also use it for work but that's typically more light internet use video calls Microsoft office use. My issue deciding lies in the configuration options I am left decide between. I don't particularly touch screen as I don't think I'd ever use it therefor would be paying more plus adding some weight for something I don't even . Problem is I can't get the i7 without getting the touch screen. My questions are as follows 1. What is the difference between the non-touch anti-glare screen vs the touch anti-reflective screen? In what way would I notice these differences? 2. Is there a battery performance difference between the i5 non touch the i7 touch configuration? I know the 4k model has significant loss. I do not that model 3. i5 vs i7 differences? As far as I understand the major differences is the G7 graphics which would mostly or only matter I was going do some heavy gaming. Am I correct on this? Is it any faster or better for general use? x200B After looking through my options I'm left deciding between the following two configurations 1. i5 processor 16GB RAM 512GB SSD FHD Non Touch Display Black Carbon - 1 849.99 CDN 2. i7 processor 16GB RAM 512GB SSD FHD Touch Display Black Carbon - 2 199.99 CDN x200B Which model would suggest I buy? Are these the best prices? I've seen people talking about calling getting deals or going through the business page. x200B Any help is appreciated. Thank !

2,gmeg90,Dell,5,2020/05/19 16:59:22,Afternoon,Dell XPS 9300 problems I bought the Dell XPS 9300 recently have been getting screen problems each one. My spec is the i7 model fhd touch. The first one I ordered I had grey marks within the LCD Dell support were atrocious. They would not exchange told me I would have wait 14 days get a replacement for it. Instead of asking them fix it I sent it back for a refund bought another. The second one that I have now works great however I get random screen flickering. Like black white screen like a screen damage flicker. I am not sure why this is occuring is completely random. It only occurs when I am typing or whilst browsing the net. I can live it but after spending a great deal of amount on it I am worried it will get worse over time do not deal customer support as they are atrocious. The laptop is amazing but because of the problems I am thinking of moving back Mac. I am undecided on whether or not rebuy a third time see I get one without problems. If have a FHD touch model do have any issues your screen?

These according my research fit work fine so long as they are not V2 or V3 don't think they are . Tonight I fitted them the PC following carefully a YouTube tutorial I'm an engineer by trade 100% sure I didn't do anything wrong. When I plugged it back in the power it booted up on its own didn't turn back off I had no image the monitor. After 5 minutes I powered it off tried again but no luck. I removed one of the new CPU's all but 2 sticks of RAM following google fault finding did an RTC battery reset at the same time. When I plugged it back in it powered up for a second now the whole PC is completely dead. x200B Since then I have tried Several RTC battery pulls along holding the power button for a while refitted the original CPUs Remove power supply connect it the power in isolation when I hold the small black button at the back the power supply appears power up make normal noises. When I let go of the button it stops. When I fit the power supply back the PC one time it would click every 2-3 seconds but now does nothing. x200B It feels like there is some motherboard fuse which has tripped or something is dead but I'm struggling for ideas on diagnosis now that I seem have tried the basics. Any help appreciated!

The temperatures are fine below 70 degrees. The power supply is OK no charger warnings 130W brick. No change in switching between AC battery.

Tried install some of the drivers suggested for Windows 8.1 but still no change. Updated them the latest via snappy driver installer - no change. Windows 7 8.1 do not have the said issue. Windows 10 before the anniversary update also didn't but since it added the battery/performance slider - it stopped boosting properly. x200B Tried the following suggestions BIOS was updated latest reset via removing the CMOS battery reflashed - no change the performance slider has no effect on the clock speed added the missing power profiles - no change Dell Power Manager is useless disabled/removed intelppm.sys as suggested in some forums - CPU runs at 2.6GHz better but never throttles down when idle temperatures are high disabled SpeedStep - CPU runs at 2.2GHz same issue as above ThrottleStop seems patch the issue when setting the multiplier 31x but this is my last-case scenario x200B Any ideas besides reverting earlier versions of Windows?

1,gmcozt,Dell,3,2020/05/19 15:16:46,Afternoon,xps 9560 running 10 degrees hotter When I received my dell xps 9560 as most others it ran a bit hot. I reapplied thermal past NT-H1 reseated thermal pads as they were not really placed very well. One wasnt even on the chip! I also undervolted a a solid -0.650mV which has been stable thus far playing games some light editing. I noticed the other day that the cpu while idle is running around 40-42 instead of 30-32 which it was previously after all of the above. Also while gaming its running around 80-85 when previously was a stable 70. The undervolt appears be taking. I used HWmonitor could see the value change. I also extreme undervolted -0.190 instant blue screen. Is there a chance the thermal compound is baked needs replaced? Its been on around 2 years seen good gaming time. I cant think of anything else that could be causing it.

It's in particular when it's charging that it really overheats before I undervolted it it got so hot I could barely touch underneath the laptop where I presume the battery is situated also on the left by the charger it gets really hot. I can some extend understand this I'm using graphical intense games but after all the intensive tweaking I have done using guides ThrottleStop etc the CPU GPU temperature still sits between 55-65 when having just one browser window open one tab.

1,gmbsz9,Dell,5,2020/05/19 14:28:15,Afternoon,Dell XPS 15 9560 - Fan Noise Performance Issues Hi Dell! I have had a Dell XPS 15 9560 an i7-7700HQ 16GB RAM 512GB SSD non-touch 1080P screen for a few years now. Running Windows 10 Education Version 1909. Early on in my ownership I had issues fan noise especially when connected my Dell WD15 dock but was able resolve those had been good since then. I'd say that almost always the fans were either off or slow enough that they were inaudible the laptop would feel cool on my lap. Now again for the last 2 months approx I have constant fan noise notably lower performance than say 6 months ago. The left side all the plugs is quite warm the touch. I am assuming this is due a driver change Windows update Dell update or similar. My CPU is often clocked down 1.88GHz in Task Manager which I know can be an energy saving measure but it often doesn't appear clock back up the UI/programs will get laggy while CPU usage shows as quite high. EDIT I now see that I set the Thermal Optimized or Ultra Performance the GHz get back up 2.5 GHz or so but the fans are putting out a good howl. All I'm doing is having a few Chrome tabs open reading a Word doc Spotify Slack. CPU load 20%. Any pointers on where start? I've blown out the fans cans of compressed air got some good dust puffs out. Haven't opened it or anything more drastic. Using Dell Command Power Manager's Thermal Management setting Quiet is still audible yet more fan noise than usual anything else sounds like the laptop is under a good load even there are just a couple programs open but no real work being done. Secondary Issue /another symptom? this has been happening nearly the entire time I have had the laptop but about 4-6 times per day everything on the laptop will freeze . Moving the trackpad mouse attached the dock laptop or docked keyboard has no effect. All programs freeze. I think sound usually stops too? Resolves itself always within 5-10 seconds. Third Issue Probably unrelated but might as well ask all at once. I'm stuck at home now the laptop lives lid open on a stand my dock external monitor but when I was on campus the laptop would continue run after the lid was closed . This meant that every time I would move locations I would have sleep the laptop the power button wait 15 seconds for the lights go out then close the lid. Otherwise around half the time it would continue run in the laptop slot of my backpack sometimes overnight would just bake itself in there P.S. does DellCares respond chat messages or just PMs? P.P.S I've been having performance issues when gaming as well. See this post from a few weeks ago Hoping that resolving these low load thermal noise issues will carry over getting a better gaming experience as well.

I've gone through all of the troubleshooting options that were suggested on all of the threads concerning the issue on the dell support messageboards. Like many of the others experiencing the same issue the display works in safe mode works an external monitor. It also works I disable the 540 display driver in device manager but then lacking many features . I tried disconnecting the battery holding the power button no avail. I ended up doing a clean format/install via a USB stick the Dell SupportOS software installed the display worked until about halfway through the process then I had use an external monitor again . From there I've updated the BIOS all of the chipset drivers. I attempted install the latest display driver on the Dell support website for the XPS 130 9350 -- upon my first attempt install the computer rebooted unexpectedly. Upon my second attempt it provided me an error message saying it was not compatible my operating system. This laptop was very expensive. It's only a couple of years old has been meticulously taken care of. I tried searching through other threads for a solution I've contacted Dell support several times no luck. Has anyone had any success another fix I haven't tried yet?

I would like run at least two monitors from it a mouse keyboard camera. I would like get something 64 GB or more of RAM 1 TB or more hard drive as well as an i7 or i9 processor. The thought occurred me that I also might use it as a laptop from time time as well. Maybe a 15 screen. Right now I use a laptop as my desktop. It is kept closed two large monitors connected. I have the peripherals setup keyboard mouse it it works great. It does not have the specs listed above but I love the flexibility. I have a limited budget think this might be the way go for bang-for-buck. Are the laptops out there this computing power working well? What do think? Thanks so much!

I dual boot Windows 10 Ubuntu. Windows 10 is already installed but I'm thinking of switching AHCIP mode because I'm having problems booting Ubuntu. I'm getting mce Hardware Error TSC 0 .. Here's a picture for more details This happens each time I try boot using a live usb. I then proceeded install Ubuntu in computability mode but now after restarting I can't boot into Ubuntu it just keeps restarting bringing me back the boot selection menu.

1,gm6hzl,Dell,8,2020/05/19 09:57:54,Morning,I don't know how solve Power Limit Throttling on my 9560 I have been using for 2 years my 9560. I didn't face any issue my 9560 until today or i didn't notice issues. I was playing Valorant yesterday my fps was dropping from 90 70-60 as the time went on. Therefore i used Throttlestop know reason why fps drops i learnt that Power Limit Throttling causes reduce clock speed of CPU. I tried remove DPTF from device manager. It worked but i don't use this solution because removing DPTF can cause other issues am i right ? I tried add thermal pads on the VRM's but it didn't work. x200B Do know any other solution about Power Limit Throttling on my XPS 9560. x200B Note My PC is undervolted -125mV
0,gm699j,Dell,7,2020/05/19 09:45:53,Morning,Is there anything left for me do reduce thermals on the XPS 15 9570 ? This laptop has been nothing but problems crashing from thermal throttling when doing any intensive work or for gaming Vsync mind . I have 1. Undervolted -125mV 2. Repasted the GPU CPU. 3. Put thermal pads on the VRMs other modulus. 4. Undervolted Underclocked the GPU by 150mhz. 5. Disabled turbo boost so base clock is 2.2 ghz. 6. Bought a laptop cooler so the back plate does not get hot from the thermal pads transferring heat. 7. Clean the heat sink regularly make sure it has no dust. 8. Set fan mode ultra performance. This laptop is the worst piece of tech I have ever bought. I have sent one back for RMA once already they replaced the motherboard wiped my data a clean install of windows. It still crashes like no tomorrow. Every other day is a crash. Some days I can use it for gaming for hours on end but today it crashes 5 minutes into a game. MSI afterburner also says the temps for CPU GPU are pegged at 74C so not overly hot. Yes I know 74C is the max for GPU so it throttles . I really dont know where I am going this thread it really feels like a vent thread because this laptop has let me down so many times. Today it crashed literally 4 times so I got pissed off enough type this rant a cry for help on the dell subreddit.

Speakers not working after the service pretty sure he did not reconnect the cable as he disassembled it earlier for palm rest replacement. Wonder how it will look i sent it for service rather than overlooking it on site. Kudos Dell Malaysia for acknowledging the issue schedule a speedy on site service tomorrow for new LCD replacement pricey for cosmetic damage but still.. re installation of internal speakers. Overall the technician was courteous but need more training.

11,glt1wi,Dell,1,2020/05/18 18:44:38,Afternoon,Dell g3 3590 Hinge issue is my nightmare Hey i share how a dell G3 15 3590 laptop that i bought became a nightmare. Its been 3 months since this nightmare started. Before i start i live in Tunisia where the dell support is limited they do not have direct support in my region anyway Fall 2019 i decided buy a gaming laptop for studying/working/gaming purposes im in computer science class. Since i trust DELL i went for the G3 3590. I was super happy it its been just sitting in the desk ive been taking a very good care of it like keeping the dust away. but a month later i started noticing a tik sound that comes out of the right hinge when i open the laptop lid. So i discussed DELL Support about this. They recommended me take the laptop their service partner which is 125KM away from where i live. So i decided delay that for next month. A few days later that hinge just popped out when i closed the laptop. I immediately contacted dell support showed them pictures about the hinge that popped out they again recommended me take it service partner was told it could be covered under warranty. Thats what i did i cancelled my next week plans took the PC the service partner. I showed them the issue they took the g3 for repairs under warranty. Thats what they said . First i was happy about that but it was the beginning of the nightmare. I travelled home. 3 Weeks i did not get any information everytime i call them they dont respond. So i decided talk dell support again. Ive been politely reaching them so they contacted the center a day later i got a respond that repair pieces are not in stock I checked the internet found out that so many people started having the same exact issue about the hinge it is definitely a design flaw. Now its been more than a month i finally got an email but it was just bad news. They said that the damage was physical will not covered under warranty lid should be changed which costs around 920DT 350 thats like 30% the laptop's price. They told me confirm the repairs i should pay 50% of it first. I replied the email that i cannot confirm repairs. Contacted dell support about this but this time that was useless all they said was same thing . Physical damage cannot be covered under warranty. HOW IS THAT NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY IF ITS THEIR FAULT TO PRODUCE A DESIGN FLAWED LAPTOP THAT WILL BREAK ITSELF ????? Anyway i was hopeless i decided take the laptop back but due the Covid pandamic the country was in lockdown. I checked the service events about my laptop found out that their incompetent service partner started a dispatch without my authorization/ confirmation. I tried contact them again they dont respond phone calls I contacted Dell Support they couldnt help the only information they gave is when the laptop will be ready for pickup. At that point i was really confused this gave lots more anxiety than before because i didnt even know what happened why the repairs started without confirmation dont even know im gonna pay for that or not . I checked the internet more people just had the same issue most of them got it repaired under warranty. I called DELL Tunisia address this they said that this should be under warranty since its common but they couldnt reach the service partner. At the beginning of May i received an SMS that the laptop was ready for pickup got more confused because the sms didnt give information i should pay or not many times i try call them 5 times each day they dont respond. Yes right again i contacted DELL support again they told me the repairs was not under warranty like always they forward me contact their uncontactable incompetent service partner for further information ? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ? Until now the PC is still at their service center theyre expecting me pay them something i cannot afford i did not cause. I have no idea what do so im posting this the community I dont know i will trust DELL again after damaging me mentally giving me lots of stress anxiety for 3 months for something that is not resolved yet. Also im in computer science class without a computer i have national exams next month so i need the laptop back ASAP. Also DELL should be responsible for their service partner since they recommended me take it them. What i hated most is how they keep forwarding me contact them but they dont respond any phone calls. Also DELL was not who decided pc is under warranty or not it was their service partner who did. Im not paying any money for the repairs i should get it for free because its a design flaw. Thanks for reading this i will post any updates.

Sometime ago I started having heavy fps drops in games when I checked in XTU it was a power limit throttling when I searched online users told me it was the laptop overheating so I cleaned the dust undervolted it the heat got better but I still get the fps drops. When I bought the laptop 2 years ago brand new it came a 130w power supply but today I read the laptop power specs knew that it supports up 180w so is the 130w adapter causing this throttling yes should I get a 180w adapter why in the first place did it come a 130 one ?

2,glyzal,Dell,2,2020/05/19 02:28:02,Night,Need help for My dell Inspiron 15 7577 overheating issue. My dell 7577 specs are 7700hq 1050ti 8gb ram 1 tb hdd. Using the laptop for 1 years approx. After 8 months of using it I started experiencing overheating. So I underclocked gpu cpu tried many more things but couldn't fix it. So I had it repasted I didn't see thier work . At first temps were fine. But after 1 week or so overheating started again this time it's even worse. Whole laptop is crazy hot even the plastic guards. Because of the pandemic I can't even hand it a shop for repair. So my conclusion is that I think the shop I gave it for repasting did something wrong or didn't do it properly. So I need a temporary solution overcome overheating as I have work online for living🙂 Sorry for the paragraph. Someone plz try help me. Thanks

13,glp6s0,Dell,11,2020/05/18 14:45:18,Afternoon,Quiet mode is amazing in XPS 15! My configuration XPS 15 7590 i7 16G 512 SSD 1650 FHD. Previously I was a bit annoyed by the fan sound of the machine not only myself but also my family. I wanted it be quieter even sacrifice performance some degree. I tried tweaking throttlestop also disabled Turbo boost but didn't control the noice as I expected until I switched the thermal mode Quiet in Dell Power Manager tool. What amazed me is not only the fan sound which is so quiet even during games but also the performance. I played Battlefield 5 for 2-3 hours got very mild noise fps between 55 - 60 during most of the time in Ultra setting! I just can't believe it. The GPU frequency was around 1300MHz - 1500MHz CPU around 2.7GHz. Both temperatures were around 65-70C. I didn't feel the heat on the keyboard. I didn't undervolt GPU while undervolted -140 in CPU cap the TDP 30. But in Optimize mode in power manager the temperature was around 70 - 80C the fan was noisy. I'm going use Quiet mode most of the time this laptop.

For those that have purchased from dell.com in the past does this mean anything about expected timing of building shipping? Or does it sadly just mean I have another number associated the order? I'm only impatient about this order because I'm headed out of town 5/30 I'd love have it before then. However not the end of the world I don't. Arrives by date was 6/2 when I ordered was changed 6/3 when I got an Order Number. Not sure that's an outside estimate... As I'm sure can guess this is an XPS 15 9500. I'm in NYC.

Disable SmartByte for an instant fix Just bought an Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 I have been getting terrible internet speeds. As I type this I'm sitting 3 feet from my router while every other device on my network can get 120Mbps down - my laptop was getting 10 at best. After uninstalling reinstalling wifi drivers a dozen reboots looking at MiMo power settings every other Google result I could find... someone in the Dell forums mentioned SmartByte. What is SmartByte? It's designed throttle all non-video streaming traffic so your Netflix doesn't slow down while 're downloading something else. Mine was set throttle my connection 10Mbps down. I disabled it did a speed test INSTANTLY got my 120Mbps connection I would expect. I uninstalled it then uninstalled the SmartByte drivers services app. To do that I had disable the Rivet Dynamic Bandwidth service then reboot. Anyways I just wanted share because I was going nuts now my problem is totally fixed.

My plan was wait until a price drop as I’m a student will always get 10% off. However this 14% off sale has dropped the price 1676. And get that price my 10% off it would need drop 1862. So I’m basically asking do think the price will drop by 100 within the next few months? Because not I should buy it now EDIT I went see I could stack the discounts it turns out I couldn’t even apply the SAVE14 code. I’m really not sure why it’s happening it says the new XPS 15 is not part of the deal despite telling me use the code save money.

2,glrafz,Dell,3,2020/05/18 16:50:44,Afternoon,Dell Vostro 7590 stuttefreeze solution??? Hey guys I own a Vostro 7590 which I bought in February. I've been encountering some sort of random stutters/freezes when the laptop is NOT heavy-loaded i.e. zooming typing or watching YouTube that's it . Usually each stutter takes about 2-3 sec or 5-7 sec the laptop would resume normally anything I typed would show up on screen as well. During the stutter nothing would work the laptop simply freezes up. Stutters can happen a few times in an hour or nothing in a few hours. I had tried almost every solution posted in this thread but seriously nothing worked. However I haven't tried reinstalling the OS or moving the OS another SSD. I reserve these as my final solutions will do them after I finish my school in June. Oh I did try using the Dell diagnostic tools but it reported no problems in CPU SSD memories. Let me know how solve this puzzle. I've been trying for months couldn't get it fixed. Thanks a lot in advance!
7,gljwcr,Dell,29,2020/05/18 09:54:20,Morning,Multiple coupon codes in new XPS 15 2020  Hi everybody! I‘d been waiting for the new XPS 15 for months when finally it came out I saw the European/Italian prices I got less enthusiast than I was before... My intention was buy the new XPS 15 UHD display 16 GB RAM 512 GB SSD . Unfortunately this configuration isn’t still possible in my country but I’ve read it will be in next weeks I hope rumours are true . Apart of it being an university student I know I can use the student coupon code have a 10% discount on XPS. This is good. But starting from the actual 2599€ even a 10% discount we are over 2300€. My idea was stay around 2000/2100€ so since I’ve read that in June/July there will be Dell’s sales I decided wait this period. But now there’s another problem I noticed in old XPS 15 that I can’t use student coupon Dell’s sale coupon i.e. SAVING12 together. If I use the first then when I add the second the first got replaced by the second they don’t get merged! Is there some way use both together or have I decide what of them use? If so the student coupon doesn’t make any sense since I won’t buy XPS every day... EDIT since I understood there is actually no way use both coupons of above I ask avoiding 4K display go the FHD is a good manner save money without losing quality. So are there many differences between 4K FHD?

Even for like 10 minutes after exiting the game I still have lag spikes while using Google Chrome or trying open other applications.

Try restart while only on battery fail blue screen Shutdown. Plugged in the thunderbolt its power supply. plugged in the thunderbolt the laptop. Restarted. Blue screen/diagnostics/scans/etc - all clean Restart again – everything is fine. I've tried variations on this theme but the common element seems be starting from the battery. All drivers windows 10 up--date. Have passed chkdsk sfc multiple times. I have a case open pro support after several give--takes they me reinstall the operating system or send it in for white-glove care neither of which is appealing for myriad reasons. The laptop seems work fine other than this issue passes all the Dell tests etc. Tech support also told me that they recommend reinstalling the OS every 6 months or so which I think is absolute BS - I've never heard that before nor have I ever had reinstall an operating system in the first year. More info about 6 weeks ago I had replace the thunderbolt dock which they did then the fingerprint reader on the laptop wasn't working so they replaced the motherboard. Twice. I really don't think it is the operating system. XPS 15 Windows 10 WD19TB thunderbolt dock. Ideas? Thanks.

It's made watching anything on my laptop a nightmare. I've searched around for solutions but I have come up short. There is no 'Enhancements' tab in my device settings so I can't use the volume normalizer that works for some. I've come up a temporary solution by installing an addon in my chrome browser that can boost the audio from any playing tab by up 600% - but even that it's just about usable only on chrome. It does show that the speakers are capable of louder audio though. Is there anything I can do at a system level or a better driver? Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank .

This has gotten more frequent by now its basically a few seconds low fps going up for a few seconds then down again. E.g. I was able play Fallout 4 or Witcher 3 just fine on High/Ultra settings 45-60 fps. By now it is unplayable. This occurs on every game or application is really independent on settings when reverting low the issue persists... For some reasons this only occurs when the PC is plugged in. When on battery I get perfectly stable 30 fps. I tried reinstalling drivers running support assist etc. Nothing solved the issue. My Specs - Nvidia GeForce 1050Ti MaxQ - i7 8750h - 512GB SSD x200B Can anyone suggest what do? Thanks

0,glcyk4,Dell,6,2020/05/18 02:05:30,Night,Dell G7 really hot Just purchased a Dell G7 recently. I have noticed the PC gets really hot. At 3% CPU usage idle I am getting temperatures of 65-70 celcius. I have tried changing thermal option in alienware command center without much luck. If I set it performance power plan performance then it reaches 75 degrees while idle. I found what keeps it lowest is the dell power plan the cool thermal option. Is there any reason it's getting so hot or any way I can configure so it does not get so hot? I don't care about noise the fans can be running full blast during usage it does not effect me. I just do not like it getting so hot as it's too hot even touch the keyboard after it's been on for 2 hours. I have read online about solutions some suggest turning off turbo undercoating but others say it is bad do this...very confused on how fix it.

1,glbq0f,Dell,48,2020/05/18 00:08:13,Night,Killer wifi adapter problems on Dell XPS 15 7590 I bought Dell XPS 15 7590 this week have issues disconnecting wifi much lower speed vs any other device at home 3-4 times slower . I did all the steps described in the Internet by various other people having such issues incl. full uninstall of the killer adapter from device manager using killer uninstaller afterwards installing the latest killer package from their website. I also updated bios windows is updated. Nothing helps problem persists. Installing intel drivers seems help solve constant disconnect issue but not the speed. I also tried install the latest killer driver from dell website under support section for my device which seem be different from the latest package on killer website. But this one just does not work at all wifi adapter remains nonrecognised device in device manager after I install driver from dell website. I am totally frustrated. After paying more than 2k for the laptop it is no usable

I’ve tried going updates recovery resetting this pc wiping the disk but it doesn’t work. What I mean by that is when it boots up again it goes through the secondary keyboard all that but I think it’s because it asks me for my Microsoft account is what keeps recognizing that my profile is still on the computer. It doesn’t have support assist installed the Alienware support isn’t there a message pops up sayin that GeForce isn’t installed it automatically has my background I had before I cleaned it. Is there a way for me have a completely cleaned out computer so it looks like I just got it out of the box? Or is that not possible because of my Microsoft account my warranty dell? Thanks in advance. Also I will try respond ASAP any questions. Thanks.

Dell XPS 7390 2 in 1 vs Dell XPS 9500 UHD touchscreens on both Going into med school so I will be using laptop primarily for notetaking reviewing slides/images/videos flashcard applications web browsing Netflix/YouTube other fun shit. I like having the screen real estate of the XPS 9500 currently used a 2015 15 MacBook Pro but also like the idea of a laptop more portability ability become a tablet. My worry 2 in 1 is that the two in one feature will be more of a gimmick I don't use it that much plus battery life might be lower cuz it's smaller. My worry the 9500 is that I'll regret not having portability ability write on screen or put laptop up in tent mode when I'm watching a lecture while cooking or something. Both would have touchscreens only the 2 in 1 can become a tablet. Any thoughts are appreciated!

0,gl522x,Dell,4,2020/05/17 15:49:14,Afternoon,Stuck on supportassist can't access boot options or BIOS. Help. So I replaced my dead hard drive in a Dell Inspiron 7559 laptop was trying load windows from a USB. The first time it loaded supportassist popped up checked everything said all was good go but there were no bootable devices found. I hadn't inserted the USB yet in order test the new hard drive. So I insert the bootable USB flash BIOS the option boot from USB doesn't appear. So I restarted tried again. This time wouldn't load BIOS only popped up the supportassist screen No bootable devices found the only option on the bottom was shutdown Now that's all it will load. Both F2 setup F12 boot options are nonresponsive though they highlight when pressed still just lead the supportassist screen no bootable devices found shutdown. Any way I can bypass the supportassist screen just go BIOS boot options?
1,gl4v7w,Dell,4,2020/05/17 15:37:09,Afternoon,Recurring freezing issue G3 15 3590 I bought a G3 15 3590 about a month ago this week I started having major issues frequent freezes/crashes. Nothing I have tried seems help - I uninstalled some programs I thought were causing the issue I did a clean install of Windows 10 I made sure all drivers were updated zero success. I can’t rely on the laptop run for any length of time. It crashes while I’m logged into work applications through Citrix it crashes while I’m on Zoom charting friends today it crashed while I was literally doing nothing. Most of the time it crashes a black screen the power still on but sometimes the screen will freeze. The only way get out of it is manually power down reboot. Dell hasn’t been particularly helpful - I spent an hour on the phone them updating drivers firmware the BIOS only for it crash again literally as soon as I hung up the phone. I emailed them back only for them remind me that “freezing issues are not covered by the warranty.” I bought this thing so I could start working a couple days a week from home I’m in healthcare now it looks like I won’t be able do that so I’m livid. Anyone else run into similar issues this model? Any suggestions on what try next?

Trouble is not the system doesnt boot. I cant even launch the bios setup menu. At start up I see Dell splash screen SAS adapter startup bios messages ending AHCI BIOS not installed System halted! Alert! Incompatible processor detected. Which is odd because it was just running the system fine the processors 5 minutes prior has been running them fine for years... I have BIOS rev A08 the latest as far as i can tell mobo rev MY171 rev 2. I dont recall what the CPUs are EDIT x5365 I cant even get into the setup find out... very frustrating. I have tried pulling the cmos battery reset jumpers etc. nothing seems do anything except on first boot after a cmos reset it complains about not having config data says I need run setup which I cant because it then hangs the same incompatible processor message. Does any one have any idea what the hell is going on here? Thanks in advance!

3,gky0tj,Dell,2,2020/05/17 08:59:03,Morning,weird problem XPS 13 9300 Developer Edition screen turning off when sound plays I'm having a really weird problem my new XPS 13 9300 Developer Edition. I've updated it Ubuntu 20.04 I'm not sure this happens out of the box. When sound would plays for the first time after a while about 4 seconds the screen turns off for about 1.5 seconds then the screen turns back on the sound plays. This happens 100% consistently. If I reload the sound driver power save turned off pkill pulseaudio sudo modprobe -r snd hda intel modprobe snd hda intel power save 0 then the screen blinks a couple of times while things are reloaded thereafter it doesn't turn the screen off anymore. It seems like this is related waking the audio chip from sleep - something about that process causes the screen blink. Maybe there's some issue power management some chip related the display browns out has reset. There are no errors that show up in dmesg Xorg.0.log or /valog/messages. Haven't been able get any more information about what's going on the display. Has anyone else experienced this? If have do know it's specific 20.04? I'd rather not re-image back stock I don't have . EDIT Okay the screen just did the same thing without any audio playing while I have the audio driver loaded power save 0. Must be some other way trigger it too. EDIT2 Determined that the other trigger is preview videos starting play on Reddit. Without audio so I'm not sure why. Preview videos on Youtube do not trigger it but starting play a video in Youtube does. EDIT3 Must be something weird about how web browsers are accessing the card. I can't trigger this issue mplayer but I can Firefox Chrome. At any rate it makes the power save 0 workaround much less helpful.

About 3-years ago the keyboard started failing. A number of the keys would be difficult get Windows recognize but pressed repeatedly they'd activated eventually then they wouldn't. I ended up paying a local PC repair place 150 replace the keyboard a genuine Dell replacement HYYWM keyboard from Parts People in Austin. Well its started happening again.

I'm not a trained typist but a hunt--peck typist but surely this isn't right?

A little background I had download a fairly heavy file so I let the laptop do its job for 5 hours. Never touched it during that period. When I picked it up though it was extremely hot. So much that I could absolutely not touch the trackpad without burning my fingers but the fans hadn’t even kicked in.

It has been 2 hours since that happened when I booted it up check on it the trackpad region got as hot as before in a matter of seconds - before even going the windows 10 lock screen.

I didn't have an insane amount of money spend so I just went the base model the graphics card got a decent deal through the dell chat. I get around 7 hours watcing youtube or netflix at low brightness when I play any games I just have it plugged in. I just had a few questions about the smaller battery for the future 1. I know that eventually I will have replace the battery I plan use this laptop for the next 4 years through college I'd image I would replace it at around the 3rd year of owning it . Will I be able swap out the 56whr replace it the bigger 97 whr? I know the smaller battery there is some sort of extra drive bay or ssd slot Idk which but does this be in the way of the bigger battery? 2. Regardless of whether I am able get the bigger battery or not will I be able purchase a replacement 7590 battery from dell either 56 or 97 whr? I really would hate have use a third party battery as I've heard that some aren't good quality have destroyed the motherboards of laptops. Has anyone an older xps or any old dell machine where they replaced the battery by purchasing one from dell or what was your experience doing so?

I looked up some benchmarks the 10875H seems be approx 17% faster in benchmarks but are there any “hidden” boosts in performance for having 2 extra cores? I guess what I’m ultimately asking is is the performance boost big enough wait for them maybe offer the 8 core processor?

Other premium laptop makers offer better specs for less Asus Razer even . You can even pick up the 8 core variant of the MBP 16 1TB storage 5500M better speakers display build for a hair more or the baseline model 6 cores for similar. And probably still have deal the usual XPS garbage broken Modern standby Maxx Audio drivers potentially swelling batteries. Things that a four thousand dollar machine should not have.

When plugged in the left side using either USB c or the power adapter along the top above mostly between f2 f9 keys the unit gets incredibly hot. Fans go full speed. After a few hours computer slows down dramatically mouse keystrokes windows just about everything . However unplugged on battery no heat at all. When turned off but plugged in charge battery no heat at all. I prefer keep it plugged in my TB16 dock for Ethernet etc. while working. I have a good Dell warranty. Tech support tried all sorts of software changes but it didn't solve the problem. I finally gave up them. Anyone know of a fix this?

The problem I'm having is text looks blurry even at native resolution. First I thought it's because I'm used a much higher DPI. But the refresh at native resolution is also greyed out at 59.88 NTSC under System Preferences - Displays. I can change it a 60hz I switch a lower resolution. If I google I find several posts complaining how Mac's sometimes recognize Dell monitors as TV's force YPbPr instead of RGB. But under System Report - Graphics/Displays there's no mention of TV Dell OSD says it's RGB. Is this how it's supposed be? I tried U2720Q it can do 4K 60hz no mention of NTSC.
1,gktv7z,Dell,0,2020/05/17 04:28:24,Night,XPS 15 9570 Problem aftermarket battery So my original battery degraded very quickly I decided order a new one from amazon replace it myself. It came in I installed it it's not a dell battery some kind of knock off . The problem is I charged it a 100% watched about two hours of black mirror on battery it was fine. HWMonitor showed 97wh full capacity. When I went shut down the computer it just turned black like when someone pulls a plug on a desktop. And when I try power it on without a power adapter connected it either doesn't turn on at all or shuts off halfway into the windows boot sequence. If I turn it on the adapter plugged in then remove it everything works fine. Original battery doesn't have this behaviour. Is it just a shitty replacement battery or there is some kind of calibration process be done? I tried draining the battery 0 just left it in bios untill it shut off then recharging it 100% that didn't help at all

It has been an amazing Laptop one inexcuseable issue. Since I bought it I have repetedly gotten a BSoD the Error Message PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA. What failed WacHIDRouterISDU.sys about once or twice a week . The Bluescreen only occured while using the Dell Premium Active Pen. x200B After months of being in contact the support which was no help at all they blamed the issue on multiple reasons including my WIFI Router Asus mind the word Router in the error message . x200B Taking matters into my own hands I researched the problem found that it is caused by the driver of the Dell Premium Active Pen which is a Wacom Product the Dell brand on it. x200B After reinstalling the driver It has not gotten a new update since September multiple attempts at troubleshooting I experienced the problem again subsequently contacted the support again. This time they told me that they cannot do anything about the problem as the driver has not been fixed will never be fixed. So they told me reinstall my operating system but said they were not sure whether this would fix anything. Has anyone of had this issue their Dell XPS13 2in1 their Dell Premium Active Pen?

Ever since a few months within getting it it's been a long hard-fought war thermal throttling issues battery life. I've been fighting it by opening the chassis unplugging the battery. This would give me good performance only for a few days. After a while using editing software or even having multiple google Chrome windows open would result in an excrutiatingly laggy experience. I've even replaced the battery but didn't get any significant improvements in battery life. Essentially this laptop must be plugged in at all times as a college student that edits films this has been unsustainable. Also the fan is basically firing at full speed at all times now. At this point I wonder should bother trying under vault the CPU GPU get the newly announced XPS 17 better thermal management or just migrate a new system entirely Macbook Pro . Any suggestions would be appreciated. x200B CPU is low when doing intense tasks

But I take out the HDMI cable the Samsung goes dark . Because of where the Optiplex is located next TV it is not practical for me have two displays connected it all the time. I'm looking for a solution where I can get it work either no 2nd screen or somehow tricking the Optiplex think there is a second screen. It seems that somehow the signal that comes out of the Displayport changes in something the Samsung cannot recognize when there is only one screen connected. I was in contact Intel customer support Intel i5-6500T HD530 they checked that all the drivers were up date their guess what that the problem must be either BIOS corruption or that the manufacturer designed it this way.

My current laptop is yoga 720 15 I've never owned a 13inch device before. I have a GTX 1070 external GPU a monitor so the GPU in the XPS 15 isn't much of a deciding factor. My main problem is that 1. I don't know I would enjoy a 13-inch laptop more than 15 or I would miss the big screen after the honeymoon period. 2. I plan on doing some video editing but not sure the 13inch EGPU would be able handle it or I should get the H processors for future-proofing. I get the 15inch XPS I can sell my EGPU so effectively the price is about the same. However I'm going probably get the 4k screen the 15inch instead of full HD touch the 13.

While this is occurring the computer will completely freeze. I'm confused as what can cause this issue. All of the other components display normal usage levels but the GPU spontaneously gets swamped by these processes. This error is easily reproduced while playing games occasionally happens while doing mundane tasks like browsing the internet. Note that the problem occurs on the integrated GPU while the Nvidia GPU is being utilized by a separate program. I also have a second display connected through HDMI. I do not know how long this has been going on until I discovered activity from dwm.exe I assumed my laptop had common thermal throttling issues. Any ideas as what could be the source of this activity? Thank . Edit Sometimes this occurs while streaming video the video will freeze until gpu usage drops back down.

2,gkfenm,Dell,0,2020/05/16 11:10:22,Morning,SOLVED Auto Screen Dimming Adaptive Brightness disable on Inspiron Laptops If have sensitive eyes might have noticed that the laptop screen 'dims' when 'bright' windows are displayed on the screen. It appears that this has do some Intel 'automatic' power management Adaptive Brightness that somehow believes that just because more pixels are 'white' that somehow corresponds a need envoke some power saving in the backlight LEDs. There does not seem be a way disable this 'feature' in Windows or the Intel driver. See this post I was reviewing my BIOS settings I saw a strange setting for the Video submenu Dynamic Backlight Control Enable or disable the dynamic backlight control. Page 72 of 80 here I believe this is the key permanently fixing the issue - simply disable the feature in BIOS. I have not taken the time see re-enabling it in the Intel display driver will work. Once again it comes down RTFM

I'm just sharing two different experiences I had Dell Support HP Support in France 🇨🇵. I hope 'll have better luck than me your computer local support. So basically I own an XPS 13 9370 top specs 2k€ my girlfriend owns a HP Spectre 13 2019 top specs 1.8k€ . These devices have similar specs were the best of the highend ultrabooks that Dell HP sold by this time. We are both happy our laptops. I'm not mentionning the price of these PC show by balls but just have context for the following. More than a year ago my powerbrick died during premium support period . Same thing append for my gf few days ago. Here's how both premium supports managed our problems HP Me Hello my PSU died HP I'm sorry. You have premium support I'm ordering a new charger right now will receive it in 2 3 days. Total phone call duration less than 5 minutes litteraly Dell Me Hello my PSU died Dell Ok np just let me check few things it will be very quick. Dell also Ok give me access your computer support assist lol I bought my XPS Ubuntu hopefully I already installed Win10 plug unplug your charger 5 times from your laptop the power outlet do the same thing in BIOS again in testing mode. Me after 30min of tests Bro please I have work do can't just send me a new PSU ? Total phone call duration 45 minutes it could have been longer I didn't say stop. I think Dell in Europe have a lot of thing learn in Premium Support . I'm just sharing this particular experience because I can compare this exact same situation HP but I also get a lot of problems Dell Support on my XPS high end servers in my company I'm sysadmin . That's very sad because the only laptop that I feel like better than mine is the new XPS 13. But regarding the support I don't think I will ever buy again a Dell product.

My XPS was prone overheating a couple months back did some repasting adding thermal pads the vrms a couple of days ago I noticed one of the pads had moved was blocking the fan flow this was visible from under the laptop. Last night as I was removing the back cover a loose metal component was moved touched something on the motherboard which resulted in sparks. The laptop turns on but after 30 seconds shows two Amber followed by white led indicating cpu failure. There is visible damage link images at the bottom. The laptop was purchased off eBay dell have said that they can't provide support as the previous owner was meant send it back dell the laptop is on hold or something. They said the only solution would be contact the previous owner get him send it back which is just stupid really. Not feasible at all. My question is whats the solution here? I'm guessing the motherboard has be replaced but I'm hoping there's a cheaper solution. I'm a student so I'm strapped for money a new motherboard is approx 500. Also there's coursework on the internal drive I'm wondering the data is recoverable at all. Any advice or help is appreciated!

I plan install Linux mint on my XPS 13 9300. Am I right in saying that installing Linux on an XPS 13 will in effect make my warranty useless even it's a hardware problem? Will most things just work or will I need try find install drivers for every component in the laptop? Has anyone tried this? Was there much troubleshooting involved? Would really appreciate any input

XPS 15 9500 already launched in many countries so anyone has any information about an India launch it would really help. Also do I have any other options except buying it from Dell India? Getting it shipped from the US doesn't seem like an option in the current scenario the virus.

However yesterday one of the keys would tilt the side kind of get stuck. I took apart the key see what was wrong part of the little plastic hinge had cracked. I was really annoyed frustrated but figured I could just get a new key I wouldn't mind spending the few bucks for it. Except can't get keys for the XPS 13 9300. Dell doesn't sell em no third parties sell em. After digging through dells website not really being able find a good way reach them I decided message their Twitter support account yes I made sure it was the official one. A minute later someone got back me. And guess what I have ship the laptop back sell for repairs. But the crazier thing is that the entire keyboard has be replaced. They can't simply pop in a new key. Oh well wish me luck.

Issue The computer has been running a bit hot via CoreTemp Intel Extreme Tuning Utility 80-100C. Sometimes it will just restart. Sometimes a program will freeze then when opening task manager it will not open up will not restart without a hard shut down. The fans are not spinning fast seemingly ever anymore. I had this problem when I first got it but it's been running fine for about a year now until this. After a clean install all drivers are up date via windows update support assist. I re thermal pasted no change looked fine. Fans sinks are clean. It doesn't matter there is a fanned laptop stand under it. It doesn't seem matter what Dell Power setting is being used nor Windows Power setting. I've heard undervolting spelling can help but the option is greyed out I do not see any current help on this topic especially not the undervolting missing. I'm out of ideas. TIA

Called the bank straightened it out then called Dell finish the purchase. Or at least attempt . You'd think businesses would make it easy for drop 3 grand them. Nope. So far my experience included 78 minute hold times only be transferred someone who claims be a Dell operator who connects me another employee who claims be an operator. I When I did finally get an employee help they started doing shady things changing the order number using high pressure sales techniques. Then they get upset I didn't finance it would not take no for an answer. I've been a long time Mac user it took a long time for me try alienware. This whole ordeal has me thinking I should stick mac.

From the get-go I've realised that the laptop easily gets very hot the touch within a couple of minutes of turning it on I also realised that the fans were constantly loud even after I'd changed the fans be quiet. 3 days after I had started using my new laptop I was streaming Netflix the whole laptop froze I couldn't turn it off I couldn't move the mouse cursor or anything - it was useless. To solve this problem I had let the battery die. I've contacted Dell support the 2 people I spoke over the phone said these were common problems the model I own. Is this normal? Is anybody else having these issues? Can somebody try recommend some solutions these problems? I use this laptop for schoolwork I can't have it completely freeze up on me again or I'll lose time/work progress.

My first experiences this laptop were that it ran really hot on games like GTA V 90 100C it was frustrating me. I then decided under volt the laptop also disabled turbo boost that has been the best decision ever for me. Who knew gaming on just 2.6 GHz would still be smooth as hell Ultra graphics on GTA V. Temperatures sit around 60-70C while gaming for hours on end. Honestly now that the laptop runs so much cooler I'd say this laptop is perfect for what I use it for. I also am using a cooling pad as well.

I am kind of new all of this have been looking into undervolting so I can get better thermals while playing less-demanding games mainly right now apex gta v. I tested apex no undervolt settings at minimum a capped frame rate at 60 but was getting temperatures of a maximum of 99 degrees much too hot for my liking. I tried using XTU undervolt but on the version of the bios I have I guess that it is blocked. I just downloaded throttlestop it let me play the undervolt values but is it actually undervolting the cpu or is it still blocked like XTU? I'm on bios 1.6.0 it allows me undervolt on throttlestop what value should I offset it by considering that I have the lower-core i5. Thanks for the help!

1,gkcfk8,Dell,0,2020/05/16 08:33:21,Morning,Samsung PM1643 Enterprise SAS SSD won't work in Dell Poweredge R510 PERC H700 or H200a - why? I've bought some brand new Samsung PM1643 1TB SAS SSDs for my Dell PowerEdge R510 Server a PERC H700 RAID Controller. Unfortunately they don't work I don't know why. When I insert a SSD the Power LED goes up the activity LED starts blinking indefinitely. During that blinking all other installed drives stop blinking the host system freezes. When I pull the SSD everything goes back normal. The host works again the other drives are blinking again. So I assume that the SAS-Bus is blocked when I insert the SSD. I tested the drives also in a Dell Poweredge T310 a PERC H200a controller. Here the Controller recognizes the SSDs but instantly marks them as failed makes them unusable. The firmwares on the controllers are the latest. Does someone knows why this is happening or what can I do about it? FYI I work as a System Administrator this is my private home server I use as my homelab. Other 3rd-Party-SSDs like Samsung 860 Pro are working fine. Only the PM1643 won't work. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
1,gkc032,Dell,1,2020/05/16 08:10:32,Morning,Warranty help please I spent literally hours yesterday on the phone chat. On the phone I kept getting transferred different people which ultimately ended in me getting hung up on after loooooong wait times between transfers..... Chat just said call. I've sent emails which have not been replied as well. I bough a R7 used. I filled out the transfer request got a reply saying that it cannot be transferred because the service tag is under an active lease. 1 What is a lease what does this service tag being under an active one mean for me? 2 Am I under warranty right now? 3 What do I need do get it transferred? I really get this done since it still has premium support for like 15 more months! Thanks!

I've been gaming on this laptop for over 2 years without any issues getting constant 60fps at games ranging from The Witcher 3 GTAV but recently it's been getting REALLY hot I'll get random drops in frame rate often enough make the games unplayable especially in busy scenes a number of characters interacting . I even took the laptop apart applied thermal paste clean out any dust that I might have accumulated there was hardly but that has yielded no improvements or at least nothing that I can notice . At this very moment when I feel just above the keyboard I can tell it's somewhat hot HW Monitor tells me CPU temp is at around 60 across all cores GPU temp is at 55 at 0% utilization even though I just have a few tabs on Chrome open a few background apps which I've always had. My drivers are updated 445.87. I even tried a hotfix driver 445.98 but that also did nothing improve the situation. These are the specs Intel Core i5-7300HQ 2.5Ghz GTX 1060 Max-Q 16GB of RAM Windows 10 Home I'm no expert at computer hardware so please let me know require more info . Has anyone else had this issue?

1,gk6z7x,Dell,5,2020/05/16 02:57:18,Night,Experience the new XPS 13 Dells terrible QC Thought I'd let everyone know about my experience the a new XPS 13 Dells pretty terrible quality control/customer service. x200B First off the design of the XPS line is unreal its so far ahead of the competition. The trackpad is great the keyboard is almost as good as my ThinkPad. x200B 2 weeks ago I ordered an XPS 13 for about 1500 arrived a few days later there was a stuck pixel that was only really visible in certain conditions annoying but I get why something like this would pass QC. There was also a tonne of coil whine but I didn't report this as a fault. I get in contact Dell I'm offered a full refund or an engineer out fix it. When I requested an exchange I was told that wasn't an option. I spent over an hour on the phone before requesting a call back from a supervisor which I hate doing . The supervisor offered me an exchange which was great. x200B A week later the new unit arrives everything seems fine but I notice what looks like a bit of grit or a chip in the palm rest coating...it was small but on a 1500 premium device? Damn. This unit also suffered from coil whine when fully charged that got noticeably worse when scrolling around. I contacted support again I didn't go through the whole getting a supervisor thing I was tired of copy pasted responses via email so I accepted a repair for the palm rest asked that the engineer bring another motherboard so he/she can decide the coil whine was within spec it was possible I just noticed it more because the fans are rarely running . The following day I notice another stuck pixel again only visible in certain conditions but what the hell? I wasn't about have half the laptop replaced when it was 48 hours old. x200B After 2 weeks of faulty machines I'm done I'd rather have a thicker machine that doesn't give me a constant headache of faults.

Today I was running a game when everything started running at a snail's pace the whole thing crashed. Whenever I turned on the PC I would get a blue screen saying that something went wrong my computer needed restart. This happened a few times before it turned on a white screen this time a new message saying that the AC adapter type could not be verified that the battery may not charge. This happened a few times never letting me start the computer any further until I decided run the diagnostic which allowed me into the computer. I thought this was the end of it but I noticed that the charge of the battery was at 9% not moving up nor down. It just said plugged in didn't show how much time till fully chsrged. I downloaded an app verified that the battery was not charging. So I restarted the computer got the message about the AC adapter again so I tried a few other power cables all resulting in the same message. I ran the diagnostics checked the battery section this time. It showed that the battery health was excellent it showed the battery's voltage displayed that it currently had 7% power left. At the bottom next AC Adapter it said Unknown. I've tried unplugging the battery which is built-in the system by the way starting the computer but I still get the message after plugging it in again starting the computer nothing changes. Any ideas on what's going on here as well as how fix it? I can attempt get specific machine specs it's deemed necessary

Or even mirroring the screen correctly . Removing the battery powering on from the mains charger only. From what I've read I will have return the laptop Dell pay something like 800 replace the screen entirely. Would anyone have any ideas on what do? Is there anyway reflash the LCD firmware externally.

Nothing super fancy but it’s perfect for my new working from home occasional gaming regime. But sitting at my desk I put my phone on the monitor stand thought. This would be so much better this stand was a wireless charger. Then I wondered. Maybe I can buy a stand one built in? Maybe a 3rd party VESA Mount stand or something exists. And then... I find this in all it’s amazing glory!! It’s perfect the stand looks compatible my monitor a P2219HC! I’m set! But then I can’t find the part available on the website. Then after a long chat Dell I find out it’s compatible but they don’t sell it separately.... my heart is broken.... my dreams shattered.... the perfect monitor accessory that exists just isn’t for sale. But why Dell.... but why.... Just wanted share my story. Maybe someone has another idea for me? TL DR Dell have an awesome monitor stand built in wireless charging but don’t sell it as an optional accessory.

I was about buy the XPS 15 7590 brand new for uni but as the 2020 version has just been released I'm a bit sceptical that the 7590's price hasn't been reduced at all I'd hate pay 1500 just see the price slashed after a month or so. x200B Additionally is it worth trying save money buying a refurbished laptop from the Dell Outlet? My primary concerns this were that a majority of the laptops had 8th gen processors I get one that's fairly recent 9th gen or better so that it can keep up my needs for a few years not have worry about 'wear tear' for a while . My other concern was that the previous user was careless the laptop not in a cosmetic way but in a less obvious way like causing it over heat those issues will begin surface a while after the purchase having an impact on the laptops life span. x200B Any advice / input is greatly appreciated thanks.

I know Dell released the 9300 line this year that is supposed be an upgrade over last year's 7390 line. it does seem they upgraded some small things like like the screen ratio 16 10 vs 16 9 another keyboard upgrade. However it seems the newer processors are slower? There is quite a bit of an increase in the price as well. Newer models vs Older models 
3,gjum7g,Dell,13,2020/05/15 12:42:13,Morning,Troubles the XPS 15 9560 Unsure anyone else has had these troubles or this is the right subreddit for this.... My XPS CPU i7-7700HQ NVIDIA GPU GTX 1050 don't seem be distributing workloads quite right. I play a fair amount of video games Rocket League CSGO every now then my frames drop practically zero from 70. And it will hold that way for 10 seconds or so until things seem settle. When I open up system processes I notice that my Integrated Graphics usage seems be at 100% while my GPU usage is at 20%. And the only time my GTX 1050 seems be doing anything is in games. I went into NVIDIA's control panel set preferred graphics card for everything as my GTX 1050 yet my 1050 seems be doing no work at all unless im in a game. Even when watching youtube videos my integrated graphics card is doing all the work my GPU is supposedly doing nothing. And I mean nothing. Control panel says 0%. Anyone else had this problem? Do I have a dead/dying chip? Things note I am hooked up an external monitor via HDMI I noticed that the HDMI port is connected my integrated graphics card not my GTX 1050. Figured the integrated graphics card would just operate as a pass-thru... . I've had similar struggles however when not hooked up a monitor the monitor actually seems alleviate the problem somewhat. The spikes aren't as frequent or as bad.

Kinda disappointed that this has happened after only a few months' gentle use around the house. It started out by a mechanical separation of the toggle holding it in Since then the adhesive holding the strip in place has started fail across the rear strip. Now just a few days after this started I'm left gross dangling rubber grips I'm guessing the right adhesive could help fix this but I'm not sure which one use. Or I could just completely detach the strip. Any advice on what do? Edit I used some loctite super glue put the grip back on. It looks kinda shit but it's on the bottom of the laptop so ツ /

9,gjkbjg,Dell,42,2020/05/15 03:10:36,Night,XPS 15 9500 UK possibly applies EU  So as we all know the new XPS have dropped yay! . However the pricing in the UK EU stores is horrendous. There's also no option for the i7-10875H which the 8-core i7 version or the base 8GB RAM/256GB SSD so can upgrade yourselves for a lower price . Just thought I'd share all that I just got off the chat a sales rep she implied that while not yet available this processor more configuration options will be more likely than not coming this side of the Atlantic in the next weeks. Also I mentioned the price difference compared the US I'd just like for all be insistent on getting a good price as they can definitely go close the US prices. Don't get ripped off people an upgrade is not urgent just be calm wait as sales are coming in 4-6 weeks!

3,gjnjf4,Dell,9,2020/05/15 06:36:30,Night,Dell XPS 15 2020 56Whr battery? The new XPS 15 has been announced it is already available on the European store. While looking at the specs I had noticed that the cheap variant which is sold for about 1699€ of the model has a 3-cell battery 56Whr. IMO this is quite small especially look at the xps 2019 which had a 97Whr for all variants. But I'm also not willing pay an extra 400€ for the model 86Whr it also has a dedicated GPU which I don't really need...the integrated intel graphics card of the cheaper model is just fine . So I need ask how much is the expected battery life for the 3-cell 56Whr battery? Is it worth it spend 1699€ for such machine? I would like be able bring the laptop around me without constantly being forced bring also the charger every time. Keep in mind that I would be using it just as a regular user. No gaming no video editing or cpu intensive programs. But I sometimes use my current machine watch some youtube in my free time or use google meet skype etc. Any help is appreciated.

2,gjqvd8,Dell,7,2020/05/15 09:30:29,Morning,Dell G7 7590 high power draw at idle I have a brand new G7 7590 I'm trying figure out this laptop has a problem or this is just the design. Some online reviews have indicated an idle battery life of many hours plus a low idle power draw in the 10-20W range. This is what I was expecting based on other i7 Dell laptops I have. But this new beast will never draw less than 45W when plugged in or 30W on battery at idle . Since the battery only has 60 W-h this means the max battery life I can achieve is 1.5-2 hours completely idle. I feel like there's a setting somewhere I'm missing that is the key get this idle load much lower or there is some component drawing a ton of power. The laptop specs G7 7590 i7-9750H RTX 2060 CPU 32GB RAM 1TB Sata SSD NVMe 500 GB All drivers BIOS are 100% up date. I typically run it in Quiet power mode although honestly I haven't seen any difference in idle power draw no matter what I set this mode I do see a difference when under load however . Similarly setting the power mode high performance or balanced seems make no difference at idle. Update 5/18/20 I seem have found a fix for my high power draw problem. I went into the NVIDIA Control Panel changed the Preferred Graphics Processor High-Performance NVIDIA process instead of Auto-select my idle power draw dropped from 35-45W 20W while plugged in 20W while on battery. I have no idea why this matters but in case it can help someone else I'll leave this here. Strangely enough I lock my computer the screen turns off the power draw goes back up into the 30's until I log back in. And then it drops back 20W.

1,gju5pf,Dell,5,2020/05/15 12:18:19,Morning,Anyone who has experience the new XPS 13 models... Hello For anyone who has/had one of the new XPS 13 models I have some questions that I'd like ask. I previously had an XPS 13 7390 last generation an i7 8GB of RAM 256GB of storage I was very dissatisfied it especially for the price point. There were a few things that model that really irritated me I'd like know they were resolved in the new model. For reference I went through two separate models of the XPS 13 7390 they both had very similar not the same issues. The new XPS looks really nice but I don't really trust Dell anymore. Especially since all the reviews I see are filled overwhelming praise didn't discuss any of the issues I experienced 1 When the laptop is open 90 degrees does it tip over from side side when press down in the bottom left corner of the bottom panel near the trackpad ? This bugged me a lot especially when typing I heard absolutely no word about it from anywhere. I had put a few layers of tape on the bottom just so that it would remain stable. 2 Is the keyboard good? I heard tons of praise about the keyboard before buying but I was very disappointed in it. Although there is a large key travel the keys would very often get stuck the key wouldn't go completely down. Again very irritating when typing. 3 Is the fingerprint scanner reliable? In my experience it only worked around 50% of the time I ended up just using a PIN enter my computer because I'd be spending so much time fiddling the sensor trying position my finger in different ways for it work. 4 Does it take a long time wake up? I have a nearly 10 year old garbage laptop that wakes up very quickly from being on sleep but the XPS 13 consistently took over 10 seconds boot up I'd often have smash the keys or hit the power button just for it wake up from sleep sometimes I'd have restart it because it wouldn't respond . 5 How is the fan noise? In my experience it got extremely loud notably when charging even under very small loads. Seriously like a jet engine. I tinkered in the BIOS found a setting remove it but it compromised the performance of the computer. 6 How is the battery life? Again I heard lots of praise about this in reviews but it didn't meet my expectations at all which I'm not super surprised about because it doesn't have a big battery on paper . I'd have my computer on the lowest brightness setting on battery saver mode I'd go from 100% just below 80% in a 75 minute lecture doing nothing more than writing in a google docs document opening a couple PDFs so it would barely get me through the day. If guys have any experience one of the new XPS 13 models the regular or the 2-in-1 please let me know 've experienced any similar issues. I would appreciate it a lot! Thanks!!

Why do think they don't give a more precise date? And when do think it will actually release? Heard any rumors? I'm kinda torn between buying the 15 or waiting. The improved thermals in the 17 just sound so promising.

I’ve checked before buying that TPM chip is there. After updating latest BIOS 1.11 installing Windows 10 1909 I found that TPM chip is not working. The error is Storage TPM not ready . Screenshots here TPM 2.0 TPP in bios so it is a Intel Firmware TMP is there in Device manager but cannot use it. Dell support said after one a half hours of investigating me waiting ”Dell supports only the Operating system shipped the computer. Anything apart from that our support is limited. TPM bit locker is related window technology which we will not support as the system was originally shipped Ubuntu.” Just sharing I’ve lost 2 days find that there is no fix for this. Firmware downgrade is not possible. Any ideas for a fix are welcome.
1,gjnd0m,Dell,5,2020/05/15 06:26:55,Night,Please Help. My XPsS 9570 wont boot I’m panicking a bit here any help would be extremely appreciated. My 9570 will not boot past the dell logo this morning. It spins for a bit then seems show one frame of a 0% complete windows update then resets starts all over again. I’m unable get into windows. My laptop has not been able do Windows updates for the last 6 months or so. I know my fault for not keeping it up date. Problem was I would try the update would always fail revert back the same version I was on. I think this is a failed forced windows update that’s messed up my system. I backed up some important files last night because it randomly rebooted a “repair” mode or something last night that seemed like windows may have been trying force something but I still have more stuff on there I’d like retrieve. What do I do how can I save my files? Thank so much anyone who can save me

Ive seen a teardown by Dave Lee of the XPS 15 9500 noticed the cooling being somewhat similar the Dell g3 15 2019 I read an early review which mentioned that the Cinebench scores stayed consistent whereas the previous model would throttle at stock be it either thermally or power that it stayed at 84 degrees which seems cooler as previous models would reach 90-100.

2,gji9m0,Dell,7,2020/05/15 00:25:57,Night,Dell XPS13 9300 or Surface Laptop 3 ? Hello ! For a few months now I've been looking for a new laptop. I it look nice so it came down these two as I absolutely love the Surface's design the screen on the XPS is really sexy. I've recently found out that there are differences of hardware though. I'm going for an i5 model I saw that the Dell has the i5-1035G1 Intel UHD when the Surface has the i5-1035G7 Iris Plus. So is the one in the Surface gonna perform better overall the Iris Plus ? My usage would be - 90% web browsing Word stuff media consumption - 10% occasionally editing photos maybe light videos when I'm not home - 1% play some not very demanding games even at low settings x200B So which one should I prioritize ? Is it a real difference between the two ? And does it impact battery life as well ? Thank guys.

Apart from it being a beast an amazing screen I am having some I believe graphics issues that I haven't been able resolve. While on a video conference Microsoft Teams mostly the screen starts misbehaving. Scrolling stutters I see white black parts on the screen faces in the video conference stutter or freeze etc. Audio works fine. Sometimes there's a complete screen freeze frozen app view or desktop so I need do a hard restart. Sometimes it stutters then continues without any message on the screen - only an error in the Reliability Monitor. When this happens I am receiving a Windows / Hardware Error in the Reliability Monitor. My guess is that Intel Iris drivers provoke this error happen. I have Dell Command Update installed have already performed an Advanced Driver Restore. What would recommend trying next? Anyone similar issues? Thanks all best.

Half way through a game of League Tuesday night the team chat started sounding like they all went into different rooms. I rebooted all but I play a YouTube video at about 60% volume it has a very sharp crackly sound. It's bad. The little tones from Win10 notifications are also horrible. x200B Time for a new speaker on that side I'm thinking. I've had very good luck Dells in the past. The last service call I had make was like 9 years ago so I don't know the best procedure. Just call? Go the support.dell.com portal? Chat? What's the best way go about this?

As far as I know Dell doesn't require the device be totally cleaned up. I just remove any trace or my users windows google in the device. What's the easy way do this? I'm returning it getting a refund. Customer support seemed very casual about the return. Said I could just put it in the box wait for someone pick it up. When I asked I needed tape it up he said yea sure . Seems weird there are no specific instructions. I just be sure Dell won't have basis for not giving me full refund.

How can I return this 530 paperweight for one that doesn't have hardware defects considering I have a warranty until 2021? It is only 4 months old so I guess it came out of the factory sideways

I first looked at some gaming laptops but then decided scale things down until I found the XPS 15. It looked perfect within my price range dedicated graphics portable good battery life. Upon further investigation I found a plethora of problems on the forums Reddit. Thermal throttling battery expanding a poor wifi card. However I did also find mixed fixes the thermal throttling through undervolting repasting as well as upgrading the wifi card. Then I found out that a BIOS update removed the ability undervolt?? There were also positive reviews of the XPS 15 confusing me even more. This leads me my problem that I can’t find another ultraportable the same performance capability other than the XPS 15. I have seen the latest 2020 model I’m enticed by the improved cooling screen however there’s no option a dedicated graphics card within my budget. Would the XPS 15 be worth purchasing these issues in mind are they as prevalent as they seem?

I ordered a custom config XPS 13 9300 i5 256gb ssd/16gb ram on April 30 estimated delivery date was May 25. I received it today May 13 . It was delayed one day at the front end due a credit card issue on the back end it was actually supposed arrive yesterday but I got a notice Purolator that it had been delayed 1-3 days due current pandemic measures . I'll be returning this one as I ordered a different config i7 FHD 512gb ssd/16gb ram the one i wanted originally when I discovered it on sale after the first order. That order was confirmed May 7 estimated delivery date is June 3 but I am hoping I get a quicker than expected turnaround on the second order too.

Dell bios returns a fair status for battery health. After 18 months of using the machine I find it be way too much. I tried calibrating the usual way no avail but it is my understanding that Lith-ion require another procedure. There is also a strange thing happenig in order calibrate the battery I set critical charge at 1% in windows 10. Then I entered dell diag mode from the bios in order drain as much juice as possible. Strangely the laptop held almost an hour while probing such elements as the memory the UC. Meaning that calibration is more than inaccurate so much power is still available when windows shuts down the machine. Any idea on how set this straight? Many thanks

I say IF it goes sleep because sometimes it doesn't even do that. The screen just goes black the fans are still going for a long time. As a developer always on the go this is a real PITA because I am forced always restart my environment is eating in my time a lot. I saw this problem in a number of posts in Dell's support forums but none of the solutions there helped me out. I updated all the drivers I have the latest BIOS update maybe this made things worse I disabled hibernate mode made sure sleep mode is active I tried disabling the Bluetooth removing any peripherals when putting the laptop sleep still nothing. This is driving me insane. It didn't use happen that often. When it started happening I looked into driver updates also updated the BIOS. Afterwards it seemed that it started happening more more often that now it's almost all the time. I also checked the Event Viewer but everything seems clean there. There's only the error that mentions that the system was shutdown unexpectedly when I force shutdown the laptop . I will appreciate any help on this matter 🙏

1,gj8905,Dell,2,2020/05/14 13:30:14,Afternoon,I am required Disable Core Parking CPU Throttling in order use my audio Interface UAD Apollo Twin X . Question about disabling Intel SpeedStep C-State Control. XPS 15 9570  So in order use my UAD Apollo Twin X I need disable core parking CPU throttling. See below for the UAD documentation on this. Without disabling I am getting severe crackles pops during playback both normal playback of files in my DAW abelton the problem is resolved immediately upon disabling core parking CPU throttling in the BIOS. See below for my audio settings the optimizations I have implemented before disabling. I am very sure this is the issue disabling is my solution. With Intel SpeedStep Intel Turbo Boost C-State Control all diasabled via the BIOS my machine is running at a constant clock speed of 2.20 GHz - when idling while under load. This is logical however not ideal considering I am losing a considrable amount of performace. I have tested leaving turbo boost on this does not have a negative impact on my sound no crackles pops allows my machine run at a constant clock speed of 3.91 GHz. My question is 1 Is there a reason the clock speed is 3.91 GHz not the turbo boost speed of 4.10 GHz? 2 Is there an adverse effect of leaving turbo boost on while disabling Intel SpeedStep C-State Control? I understand this will consume more energy but in terms of temperature am I risking overheating? Will the CPU still throttle when it hits high temperatures? I have run some initial diagnostics Temeprature while idling max core temperature 55C average 54C. Temperatures under load max core temp peaked at 86C I would say average temperature is about 68-70C. 3 Is there any adverse effect of regularly changing the BIOS settings? For example leaving turbo boost off when I do not need the extra performance then turning it on when I do? I understand I am not the first person ask this type of question but the info I have found while helpful has not got me understanding 100% of the situation. I am eager learn thank for any help this situation!

2,gj1ig5,Dell,0,2020/05/14 07:46:12,Morning,1 year old Inspiron's battery goes from 50 0 in under a minute I'm so annoyed because I took the utmost care of it. What can I do?! On the day I bought this laptop I installed Dell power manager set it so that it charges between 50 80%. As soon as it hits 80% it stops charging uses wall socket power only Since I would use it as my desk most of the time . I thought that's the best care I can take of my battery. But a few weeks ago when I was using it while sitting on my couch the ''your battery is running low'' notification popped up. I thought that was strange because I distinctly remember it having a 50% charge. Anyway I didn't think much of it plugged it in anyway. The same exact thing happened today except this time I know for a fact that it had a 52% charge. I don't know what do I did everything I could take care of it didn't let it get overheated didn't keep it plugged in overnight even did the dell power manager thing which most people do not do. What can be causing this? Can this be a software issue? I'm running the latest version of windows. Dell power manager shows the health of my battery is completely fine. My laptop just got out of warranty I don't have extended warranty for it. Even I did since Dell power manager isn't detecting any issues it Dell won't help me out. I'm heartbroken. This laptop is my baby my work depends on it I can't be having problems an expensive thing like this. x200B

However I'm trying decide the 4K display is worth it or I should just go the FHD screen. I try make my laptops last as long as humanly possible--the laptop I'm replacing a 2011 model Macbook Pro lasted me 8 years. What is the more future-proof option here? Will ALL laptop screens be 4K in a couple of years? It's about a 300 difference so not an insignificant one. Also it seems like the battery life a FHD screen is FAR better. What are your thoughts?

I was thinking on upgrading my warranty for another 2 years. First I was wondering it is sent out for warranty do they fix mine send it back or do they take mine send me back a 9570 refurbished or a new 9570 or a newer model? Secondly I was wondering there is anyways I can get my 9570 upgraded the newest 2020 xps by paying extra bucks even? Any help would be appreciated!!

1,gj4fgy,Dell,5,2020/05/14 10:18:48,Morning,New XPS 15/17's released whats next? I was pleased see the new XPS 15/17 series released today. Does anyone have any idea or has seen any rumors of when they will release new Inspiron 15's or 17's the 7000 series or what ever they will call it this time ? I do the new 10th gen processor series but I do not quite need the other specs of the graphics other things the XPS is known for. I am just looking for the good upper level mid range laptop without going the full way. I know the Inspirons the same processors amount of ram HD size run a little cheaper. I currently have an Inspiron 15 an i7-6700HK 16GB ram 1TB SSD. The thing still runs like a champ rarely slows down but I do notice the fan running more as applications are now becoming more intense updates. I guess that is what a nearly 5 year old system does. I bought it as soon as they released it this processor. I really don't buy a new one but the case has some issues of holding together Dell had probs this particular 7000 series but never corrected it other little things like power cord not the best now hinges are getting weaker. All these little things add up fix taking the time do it 5 years for a system is really good. Any direction go would be great!

2,giz7vf,Dell,1,2020/05/14 05:39:34,Night,Dell XPS 15 9570 CPU error light code but working fine mini rant included  I recently had the BIOS chip replaced by a dell certified repair shop because the original chip failed. they did try reflash the chip but the chip itself had failed After the chip was replaced I got my laptop back there were 4 major issues The speakers were no longer working a problem the intel SST driver that took me around 2hrs of troubleshooting fix the driver I manually installed fix the problem The BIOS being Password locked the BIOS dump the repair shop used flash the new chip had a bios password but thankfully I was able fix it by using have press ctrl then enter twice for the password generated on this site work. it's a recovery password of sorts from what I gather the keyboard caps lock light being constantly on this might be a hardware related issue or a software one but here's what I could gather finally the one really annoying issue the charge indicator light flashing constantly in a 2 Amber 1 white pattern indicating a CPU failiure according the service manual. Even after the BIOS has been updated the latest version the processor working flawlessly even under stress tests undervolts applied the problem persists. I can't really think of a fix for this issue as I have already reverted all bios settings factory settings updated the bios twice. I can't open up the device for now as it would void my warranty as I would have break the stickers on the screws I do not live in the states hence why I had send my laptop into a certified shop not dell directly see I could fix the caps lock issue. I don't take my laptop back the shop as their customer support is garbage they took 2 months replace a simple BIOS chip. I'm sick tired of dealing the dozens of technical issues this laptop has. Everything from the DPC latency issues the extremely agressive DPTF throttling the sleep issues this laptop has been an absolute nightmare I would not recommend anyone buy any dell XPS machine until they properly adress the issues in a new chassis the 7590 shares some issues other XPS 15 machines dating back the 9550 . As a tech savvy indivicual most of the issues I was able fix but I can't imagine the amount of people who got this laptop had deal the dozens of issues without being able fix the issues. Any information or tips on how fix the caps lock charge indicator issue would be much apreciated.

It just so happens that I had JUST started researching getting a new Win10 laptop for running Ableton Live I saw lots of stuff about DPC latency issues the Dell XPS series so I was looking at other machines. Now we have the new models today so I'm wondering anyone deeper knowledge on the topic would know how likely it is that those issues would be resolved in the new machines or maybe point me in the direction of someone who is likely be looking into the topic soon?

1,gj29t5,Dell,0,2020/05/14 08:23:55,Morning,XPS 15 9575 different core temperatures Hey guys So I've been using my 2 in 1 for university for quite some time now I loved it so far. Since I'm using a 4k Screen I know its unnecessary but who cares I tried get a bit more battery life undervolted my CPU by 0 15V which is quite good I guess temps dropped for about 10 C which I'm totally fine . Well in Cinebench runs my CPU throttled down about 3 6 GHz maintain like 90 degrees. I know Ultrabooks tend get pretty hot so I was fine that since well thats just the trade have make for it being so light. Well since I was already tinkering my device I might aswell repaste the CPU am I right? Well thats what I did grabbed my iFixit kit opened up that thing carefully removed the Heatsink CPU removed that mess of old paste. You pictures? I got So after cleaning up that goo I slapped on some thermal grizzly spread that stuff nicely on my GPU CPU well put some Thermal Grizzly Minus Pad 1mm on my VRMs. So I carefully installed my heatsink again gave that baby a slight wiggle tightend the screws. The backpanel on powered on the machine Of course the Battery was disconnected while doing the repaste I might be stupid but not that stupid . Well getting into Windows everything was fine my Idle temp dropped about 4 ish degrees well I instantly started HW Monitor Throttlestop Which is always on by default CinebenchR20 for some nice Benchmarks. This is where stuff gets weird. Well I've heard about Dell devices being super weird about cooling but dang my 3/4 core temperatures were constantly higher than 1/2. While under high load 1/2 were running at 83 C 3/4 constantly overheated for no apparent reason. Well I thought might just be a bad mount am I right? Well turns out wasnt a bad mount I repasted like 2/3 more times no difference. I didnt notice such high temperature delta when I was dealing the factory paste so what have went wrong? I noticed the heatsink does indeed has much more Paste on the upper site where I installed the new Thermal Pad for my VRMs Only the upper 4 in this picture just simply removed the Pad. And voila suddenly temperatures dropped for about 8-9 degrees but I still have a temperature delta of about 10 C. I did notice tho that my Cinebench Score increased from 1700mCore Undervolt Old factory Paste 1880mCore now Undervolt New Paste I have mention tho that I had repaste so much I ran out of Thermal grizzly had use some other 3rd party stuff But new Thermal Grizzly along wit 0 5mm instead of 1mm Pads for VRM's is on the way . While my CPU seems run hotter under full load it doesnt seem Throttle 3 6GHz straight away it tries maintain 3 7GHz which is nice seems that in the end something did work out. My Idles well dropped for 3 C I guess which is okay but I hope the fans not kicking in as much as in the past will improve battery life. Tldr Anyone else having Issues cores having different temperatures after repaste despite a fairly good mount? And would recomend putting Thermal pad on the VRM's since Its connected the CPU heatsink?

1,gj0ux3,Dell,2,2020/05/14 07:09:25,Morning,9560 no battery has reset BIOS whenever AC is removed Hi! Not really looking for a solution as I have a new battery ordered arriving in the next couple of days just curious. I removed the battery from my 9560 a few days ago as the swelling had made the track-pad near unusable. Mostly the laptop operates fine as a desktop but I have noticed that whenever I lose AC power unplugging the cable or turning the plug off the next time I use the laptop I have first reset the BIOS default settings. I always shut the laptop down properly before turning the power source off. I have also noticed that the laptop seems turn on or the fans start the power button lights up at least whenever I connect it back power before I have pressed the power button. Does anyone know what causes the computer behave like this? I am more intrigued than bothered by it.

1,gizhn1,Dell,2,2020/05/14 05:55:16,Night,XPS 7590 screen/backlight flickering when using Nvidia GPU I've had my XPS i9 32GB 512SSD GTX 1650 4K LCD display for about 6 months I think this started around a month or so ago - when I run a game or something else that uses discrete GPU the screen flickers slightly. This looks like the backlight brightness level fluctuates a bit resembling the flickering can see on old CRT screens/TV. The flickering is not consistent across different apps. For example I can run my OpenGL demo see no issues then run a test scene in Unity the flickering will be very noticeable. In games this varies. This also depends on the view direction of the 3D camera in the app but I can't spot any correlation between the amount of stuff rendered the flickering strength. It also does not matter I run the app full screen or in a window the issue affects the whole display. The flickering depends on the brightness level. I usually keep mine at 20%. If I switch 0% the issue is gone. If I crank the brightness up it becomes less noticeable higher values. At 100% it's barely visible. This is also affected by battery level charging status. I normally use Custom charging mode in Dell Power Manager 50% - 80% . I tried charge up 100% the issue is less noticeable higher charge values. The issue is completely gone when the laptop is charging or running on battery . In other words this happens only when I run on AC power the battery is idle . I heard that AC can be not enough for the GPU so it can draw additional power from the battery as well not sure it's related. I'm lost here. I have all the latest drivers not sure this started after some update or this is a hardware degradation issue I hope not . Tried downgrading video drivers no luck

I purchased this laptop at the start of the month an expected delivery date of the 28th May. However since ordering the laptop I cannot find it anywhere on Dell's website. I have my order receipt etc although my payment is still pending but I am a bit concerned why the product is no longer even shown... do have any ideas why should I be concerned??

2,gitfk8,Dell,0,2020/05/13 22:23:05,Evening,XPS 9560 can't keep up unless I tweak drivers undervolt. I've been gaming my XPS for the whole quarantine now since i'm in a tropical country I get around 65-75 C. But get these temps I have remove some intel thermal drivers turn on my undervolt its respective settings. The thing is I could run video games like overwatch minecraft other low spec games before even without the undervolt tweakings but now even chrome starts get jittery at around 55 c. Note that i've damaged my laptop already water but cleaned it off extensively 100% alcohol in the past. However my laptop power limit trottles even at just 65c.
1,giw1cx,Dell,4,2020/05/14 01:54:48,Night,I return my XPS15 7590 what's your experience Dell's returns? I bought the Dell XPS15 7590 used it for one day. I'm disappointed at the trackpad quality speakers cooling system. I return it wait for the 2020 model. What's your experience Dell's return services? I read their return policy it seems that I'll be responsible for up 15% of the original price as a restocking fee sale tax shipping cost. My laptop costs 2150 150 sale tax. Do they charge the full 15% of the stocking fee? I'm looking into a total of 400 - 500 as return fee. Do think the XPS15 2020 worth it? I'm very frustrated this laptop the my purchase timing.

I have checked the specs of the monitor the power delivery of the monitor USB-C port is 90w. I have read that XPS/Precision can be charged 90w usb-c chargers.

1,gitb2y,Dell,3,2020/05/13 22:13:12,Evening,Dell XPS 13 9333 All audio has failed except HDMI So starting a couple of months ago my XPS 13's 9333 audio output pretty much completely conked out specifically Windows displays no audio device detected -- the laptop's speakers do not work neither does the audio jack. The one audio output that does work is via HDMI output. Since HDMI does have embedded sound support I obviously tried all the software-related fixes a problem like this e.g. driver updates BIOs updates my initial thought was that it was strictly a hardware problem since my laptop has a Linux dual-boot it too reports the same problem. However upon examining my computer's service manual I found that a single I/O Board controlled both the audio jack a USB port next it which is still working. This plus the fact the internal speakers were also broken leads me conclude that this also isn't the case of a single computer part failing. To that end does anyone have any tips on diagnosing/fixing this problem? The motherboard/hard drive itself is still working so I'd prefer keep buying a new laptop an option of last resort.

Do try again enroll this finger? in the Windows biometrics enrollment fingerprint capture Broadcom software it's a USH device . It's pretty frustrating not gonna lie.

The model I 32GB i7 is currently 250 off in Canada seems like a decent deal however that promotion ends Friday. Is it safe say that the price should go down once the new model is out since this model will be outdated? Is there a big reason get the new one over the old? I see the card was changed from 1650 1650 TI although I'm worried this might cause more heat/louder fans. Thoughts?
2,gioaw6,Dell,7,2020/05/13 16:40:33,Afternoon,Choosing XPS 7390 2 in 1 - right specs. I'm undecided on what specs get. Currently thinking i7 512 16 mem Or i5 256 8 mem My reasoning get the i5 is it should have a longer battery life. I doubt I'll every edit video on it but it would be nice in a pinch. Mostly note taking code web search typical work stuff word/excel/outlook. Beyond it being a good backup my 9570 I don't know the i7 is worth it. I'm on the fence. Would love hear have the i5 or i7 your thoughts on battery life overall thoughts about the 7390 2 in 1.

I’m looking for something up 950 which size is 13/14”. I’ll be doing university work on it I’ll be doing some recording on software create demos for band. So nothing too complex. But I do a laptop which is smooth. I’m not incredibly fussed about battery life. I just something which is a joy use! I have looked at the new MacBook Air which is 900 but that doesn’t seem have the best processor. I’ve also looked at last years dell XPS 13 which I can get for 850 new. I’m still not sure though. I did previously own a Lenovo but looking for something new fresh. Thank

If need more info please let me know because I'm not good computer terminology. x200B Anyway I've had my laptop for about 8 months now my warranty is still intact. That being said I undervolted changed things ThrottleStop XTU pretty frequently. The reason I'm making this post is that my laptop is overheating like crazy which makes some games pretty much unplayable. In the beginning it worked fine as I remember getting Destiny 2 playing that for a few weeks once my computer arrived though loading it up now results in insane frame drops I wasn't even undervolting when I first played it . I also was very stupid moved the User folder from my 100GB C Drive SSD my 1TB D drive HDD which I then looked up found out was bad I moved it back . I also retroactively did research found that for the same or even lower prices I could get a computer that suffers these issues a lesser degree even though I'm not sure a refund this late is legit . I really don't know what do as this laptop can only smoothly run games that a non-gaming computer can like Minecraft League etc . x200B I know this post is really jumbled but any of yall have suggestions as what I should do please let me know. I saved up for a long time get this laptop I'm a freshman in HS so no legit job yet I don't it go waste.

1,giemnr,Dell,20,2020/05/13 08:31:48,Morning,Thoughts on the G5 15 for University/Gaming? I'm looking into the G5 15 as a laptop for class gaming I was hoping hear your thoughts on some of its issues. I'm upgrading from a MacBook so I'd love the extra performance however its size weight would be a large downside. I appreciate the discreet styling of it it doesn't scream gaming looks professional too. I'd be hooking it up a monitor so I wouldn't mind the screen for gaming. Now onto the issues firstly being the thermal throttling. I'm in no way a computer person so reading all the reddit threads about issues heat kind of throws me off. Apparently the fans are really loud as well. I've also heard mixed reviews about the battery many youtube reviews praise it for long battery life compared other laptops but I see people complaining about theirs. On the go I'd only be using it for taking notes writing but apparently even then the battery is poor? In addition apparently there's a host of other problems such as issues opening it after in sleep mode handicapped performance. Many youtube tech websites seem give it positive reviews but this seems not be the case elsewhere. I was really interested in buying the G5 but after reading all these reviews I'm a bit wary. Are these issues commonplace should I still buy one? Thanks.

2,gi9jld,Dell,0,2020/05/13 03:37:02,Night,To buy new or repair? What do not despair Hello people despite the stupid title I am having a serious issue in front of me. I have had my lovely XPS 15 9550 for little over three years now it always treated me nicely. A couple of years ago I broke the palmrest next the left hinge ever since lived without one screw the palmrest that basically lifted away from the rest of the laptop everytime I moved the screen workaround was keep pressure while opening the laptop this probably caused the issues I'm facing now the power connector moving around in these two years I damaged the battery that now lasts me less than ten minutes making it a less portable portable computer. On top of that I've always been plagued by the shitty wifi card that wouldn't work bluetooth. Now my question is would it be wise repair upgrade the laptop buying a new palmrest which is expensive hard find it takes a long time get here a new 97Wh battery removing the HDD fit it buying a 500GB SSD upgrading from 8 16GB of RAM getting a Killer WiFi 6 module? All of this would cost me between €450-500 about a month waiting for the parts. My other thought was about getting a newer laptop used one maybe but I can't spend more than €800 is there anything worth it at that price range? I kind of fancied getting a 2in1 or touch display laptop for drawing but I doubt there is one comparable performance my XPS 15 at that price range. TL DR - My XPS pretty broke spend €500 repair upgrade or spend €800 get something else? Edit adding my current specs for context Intel i5 6300HQ 8GB DDR4 RAM 1TB HDD GeForce GTX 960M 2GB

1,gicbhg,Dell,18,2020/05/13 06:32:42,Night,Dell sent back a broken laptop? What do I do? Edit since title seems a bit weird my computer was not this damaged when I sent it in In a long story short I sent in my new laptop for repairs because it was under warranty was having multiple issues. I have an Inspirion 7000 that I received as a gift since I needed a new computer for work. I bought it brand new within the short time I have had it I have had nothing but trouble. x200B I reached out dell support they remoted into my computer see the issues were my drivers. They did a bunch of changes then because nothing changed sent me a repair. In the time between that day the box their virtual repairs somehow 'broke' my wireless chip. I received my laptop back yesterday the only thing that was marked as repaired was the wifi chip... nothing else. When I opened the computer itself the pen was jammed between the keyboard the pen rest. The pen was so damaged that now it is completely broken the battery in the pen was damaged where I cannot use it anymore the pen got crushed . On top of that whoever did this repair did not do it right. For example one of the issues I was having was the left speaker was failing because it was screeching the tech's fix? Just turn the speaker off. Now only the right speaker works. My biggest indicator is that when they closed my computer up 'fix' the wifi chip which only stopped working when they changed the drivers they closed it incorrectly damaged the left side apparently from the worker I spoke at the Dell authorized repair center here stripped screws because the bottom of the computer was not put on correctly. x200B I am at a loss. What do I do? I sent them photos they are apparently escalating it determine they can fix the computer damages they made. This was not even something that could have happened in shipping because the Dell technician not only looked at the issues but said that the computer was just so poorly messed up by Dell he did not even touch it. Do I have just hope pray they will fix the mistakes they made? Has anyone had this issue before? This is my first Dell laptop I needed it for my job since I have move around a lot. I was using my gf's computer do my work but ironically her computer just broke as well so I had call out of work today. x200B TLDR New laptop lots of manufacturing issues sent back Dell the only thing they fixed was the wifi chip that they broke due installing the wrong drivers . Sent it back broken are not telling me they will fix it or not. No repair center near me will fix it because of how poorly it was fixed . What do I do??
2,gi8ms4,Dell,7,2020/05/13 02:26:12,Night,URGENT - Window 7 Pro x64 ISO for Precision 5820T needed Hello folks! I try set up an Precision 5820 Tower Windows 7 I know bad but still needed for a few months . Sadly the drivers for nearly EVERYTHING are missing in the plain Windows 7 ISO from Microsoft. Even the keyboard/mouse does not work due missing USB 3 drivers. I already tried integrate the drivers using DISM but it didn't work so far. The OS Recovery Tool from Dell doesn't help because this Workstation was originally bought windows 10. The Dell support told me try the 5810 ISO but sadly again the keyboard/mouse does not work on this one either. As I am in a hurry have get this machine up running I wanted know anyone can help me out. Maybe an ISO or at least an working ServiceTag for an Windows 7 machine so I can download the ISO on my own. Thanks in advance!

1,gia03y,Dell,5,2020/05/13 04:09:31,Night,Dell 7567 micro freezes audio stutters Hello I have almost a two year old laptop Dell Gaming 7567 7th gen i5 GTX 1050 8GB RAM model. Recently I started noticing an issue random micro freezes when doing pretty much anything i guess more often when i am watching videos or playing games . It is a maybe 0.5 - 1sec freeze when the audio just does a crackling sound during that freeze when some audio is playing then continues normally when it unfreezes. During this micro freeze i am unable do anything it is super annoying. Sometimes it happens once an hour sometimes twice an hour there is no pattern. I tried do a clean reinstall of W10 it did not help so i believe it could be a hardware issue or some recent update problem. I read on Internet that uninstalling Dell Support Assist should help however it did not fix the issue for me... Not sure i uninstall every driver test one by one. Any tips or advice how fix my issue? It is just very annoying. Thanks in advance. Edit The freeze looks EXACTLY like this however uninstalling both of the SupportAssistant programs did not help me.

2,gi2sjt,Dell,16,2020/05/12 19:05:11,Evening,Dell refused give me a refund. I purchased an XPS 15 7590 in November 2019 so about 7-8 months ago yesterday it started overheating crashing while just browsing online running a word document. It got the point where the laptop won't even startup the LED is flashing 1 white 2 amber indicating a CPU/Motherboard failure. This is a big deal for me as I run an online business as my main source of income am currently a student. So not having a laptop is making things difficult. I contacted Dell ask for a refund as under Australian consumer law I believe this is a 'major failure' that entitles the customer their choice of repair replacement or refund. I wanted a refund as I believe the repair will take too long even done well I might have deal the same issue 7 months down the line which would be outside of warranty. I can't afford buy another one Dell replied The system has been in use for 8 months. With no dispatch history or opportunity resolve the issue under Australian Consumer Law we can always offer service as a resolution. For now we'll continue archive this case. This can be reopened within the next 10 days decide change your mind. This is the third XPS I've had problems have completely lost faith in Dell. How can I get my money back?

1,gi5i99,Dell,1,2020/05/12 22:16:17,Evening,Dell XPS 8930 Randomly Goes To Sleep  Hello everyone! A little over a year ago I bought a Dell XPS 8930 desktop computer. A few months ago I ran into an issue where my computer will go into sleep mode randomly I can't wake it. I do have a wireless keyboard mouse but supposedly I should be able wake it by pressing the power button but that does not work either. I connected a dell tech that went through changed my power settings never sleep or hibernate but this still happens. I could be in the middle of something then the computer just goes sleep. Other than this hiccup my computer has been flawless. It doesn't happen often but I work from home it's happened in the middle of a shift. No Bueno! I will say I have three monitors hooked up. I don't know that has anything do it. If anyone can give me any ideas I'll watch for replies let know anything regarding specific specs need them. I'd love solve this. I spent a lot of money on this PC don't take it a repair shop. My warranty just expired 2 months ago.

3,ghz3zu,Dell,5,2020/05/12 15:27:50,Afternoon,XPS 7590 Undervolting Advice for Light Gaming I am waiting on an XPS 15 7590 laptop that I ordered recently. I am beyond excited finally have my own laptop can’t wait start using it. I am attending college next semester am majoring in EE figured it would be best get a laptop a graphics card for some more intensive programs occasional gaming. Here are the specs -core i5 -8g ram -256g ssd -FHD Display -GTX 1650 -56 whr battery It is pretty much the base model the graphics card. I figured that I would prefer the lighter laptop the smaller battery considering that it will spend a lot of time plugged in in my dorm where I can just charge in between classes necessary it’s a small campus . Now for the gaming part. I get that because of thermals that this laptop isn’t technically a gaming laptop. For a long time I wanted a MacBook but realized that I wanted windows so decided on the similarly designed XPS line. It was the best option as the other options for me was the Razer Blade 13 or 15 inch models which was far too expensive for me. I come from Xbox I can manage 30fps low-medium settings on single player games preserve the longevity of the device. The main games I plan play when I receive the laptop is RCT3 I’m a nerd I get it Apex Legends Minecraft. Rct3 can run on my toaster Minecraft is fine as well. For Apex Legends considering the fact that I have the i5 model not the i7 what should I do in Throttlestop or any other programs keep temperatures down maintain a playable frame rate. Ideally I would 60fps even that means playing at low settings however I could in theory manage 30fps because this is what get on Xbox what I have been used my whole life . I would ideally keep cpu temperatures between 70-80C as I plan keep this laptop for a minimum of 4 years. What are the best values play or enable make this happen the i5 or is it even possible?

But it’s only seeing 2 cores Howdy I just upgraded my Dell Latitude E6430 from a Core i5-3320M 2C/4T a Core i7-3740QM 4C/8T . However Windows 10 is not seeing 2 of the cores 4 of the threads. Ie it’s running the 3740QM as a dual-core 4 thread chip. Anyone else run into this? Is there a BIOS update needed? I haven’t updated the BIOS. If so where can I find it? Any other ways make it see all cores? I’ve checked in the UEFI ticked all the boxes make it use all available cores. I’ve also done the same in MS Config Boot Advanced. Any help?
1,gi3n0c,Dell,9,2020/05/12 20:00:53,Evening,Dell Inspiron 7577 throttling Hi guys.When I bought a laptop it had problems the cooling system. After 2 months I went the store I completely changed the cooling system under warranty this is important for the further story .The problems went away for some time but it seems me that the change of season played a big role here for the winter I'm from Siberia . At the moment the problem has worsened again as summer will come again the temperature in the room has increased significantly. For example in a game GTA V starts after 10 minutes at low-medium setting. i7 7700HQ 2.8HZ 8 GB RAM GTX 1050 TI M . The first question is whether this problem can be solved somehow? I have not tried processor undervoltage yet. When I wanted clean my laptop replace the thermal grease I was faced the fact that the screw that holds the cooling system is very worn out. Also the screws are made of disgusting material that deteriorates very quickly. I did not disassemble the laptop before this was clearly done when replacing the cooling system The second question is - can I somehow pull it out replace it? By the way this is the last bolt on the cooling system it ruined everything The warranty on the product has already expired. And I did not find a problem earlier because for this it was necessary break the guarantee seal. Sorry for my bad language. 
2,ghz3zi,Dell,5,2020/05/12 15:27:48,Afternoon,2019 XPS 15 whining while connected power cord Hi everyone I started noticing this strange whine from my laptop about a month ago but I thought it was just usual coil whine that the fact that I'm almost always at home now make my work enviroment much more quiet. Tonight tho I noticed that it only whines when connected the power cord. As soon as I detach it noise stops. It's pretty audible annoying from standard desk using position distance. Btw I'm noticing just now 3 mins into the charge that it's already starting heat up quite a lot in the Shift key zone. An inch on the left of it it's umbearable almost. Battery was at 13% when I started but I usually use Dell power manager do not stress it... Would call this situation normal ? x200B Marginal consideration It's the third problem I encounter this laptop last two where about bad assembly in the fron led area some little but visible space between shells bluetooth module doing some strange things not software related I'm pretty disappointed it's my first high end PC I expected a lot more quality from Dell at this point. 
2,ghyw89,Dell,0,2020/05/12 15:16:06,Afternoon,XPS 13 9300 left USB-C port not outputting over HDMI? Turn off on Thunderbolt in the BIOS. Short XPS 13 9300 USB-C port not outputting over HDMI? Turn off on Thunderbolt in the BIOS. x200B Long I ordered a XPS 13 9300 the i5 16GB of RAM in March. There a promotion get ProSupport Next Business Day Onsite for free. When the laptop arrived it worked perfectly. Both USB-C ports could output HDMI my USB-C hub HDMI USB A SD card my external monitor. After about a month the left USB port stopped outputting HDMI. Power in USB still worked. Windows showed this error Display connection might be limited. I contacted Dell ProSupport. Because it was just one port we figured the port itself had broken. I sent the laptop in the entire mainboard was replaced. Because I had ProSupport it only took a few days. Laptop comes back works great. Then less than 24 hours later the problem came back. Again sent the laptop in comes back a few days later a new mainboard. It was working well until today about a week. Same error. I called Dell again. I explained the issue I was put on hold so an engineer could be consulted. While I was on hold I tried turning off Thunderbolt in the BIOS. I'm not sure why I thought of it. After rebooting my display worked again. I was able turn Thunderbolt on again the output still works. I would guess this issue can be fixed a BIOS update but I'm not sure.

1,gi1ts8,Dell,0,2020/05/12 18:05:50,Afternoon,XPS 13 9365 won't boot just constant blinking keyboard when plugged in I need some help A few weeks ago my laptop turned on for a few moments then crashed wouldn't turn back on. I looked up some videos saw other people had experienced the same issue were able resolve it by removing the battery CMOS battery holding power button for 30 seconds reconnecting the batteries holding down power button again. I tried this would only get blinking keyboard LED while holding the power button boot the laptop wouldn't power on. I figured I may have a drained CMOS battery as I hadn't used my laptop for a while prior the crash. I ordered a new CMOS battery replaced it today. I'm still only getting the constant blinking keyboard LED when trying power on but now when I plug in the power adapter the keyboard will blink constantly either battery connected or disconnected without me trying power on. Has anyone else experienced this know what the issue is/how fix it? Thanks

I was wondering this is going cause issues for my PC in the future. Thanks in advance!
1,gi1jvj,Dell,0,2020/05/12 17:49:38,Afternoon,Latitude laptops Do think a swap is worth it? Currently have a Latitude e6220 i5 2x4GB DDR3 max for the year i think . I've been considering ordering an e6230 i7 board putting it into my laptop along 2x8GB DDR3. The whole thing would probably cost a little over 100. So I have two questions 1. Is the i7-3540M noticeably better than the i5-2520M? 2. Has anyone got 2x8GB DDR3 working the e6220? Dell claims the laptop can only support 4GB per dimm but the processor should be able handle up 16GB total. Could just be Dell's limitations though. I love these old Latitudes I feel like I can get a substantial performance boost for only 100 I might as well take it. But it's not going make a huge difference it may not be worth it.

Idling is so loud it's in unbearable. It started 1-2 weeks after purchase looking through Reddit Google I'm not the only one this issue this model. Blue screens oh the blue screens. Can't watch YouTube I can hear it over the god damn fans it just causes blue screens. Any video causes it sometimes it's out of nowhere thread stuck in device or something. I've attempted every fix short of reinstalling windows. EVERY time I do a sfc /SCANNOW corrupt files are found apparently replaced Touch pad is horrendous but that's a matter of opinion Speakers are awful. Prison walkmans have better speakers.

1,gqnm9e,ASUS,0,2020/05/26 17:27:17,Afternoon,Help Please Asus X570-Plus - Can't Get into BIOS! Hello My computer has been working perfectly the last couple days. However yesterday I upgraded from an EVGA 1070 Ti a Asus 1080 Ti Turbo. I was sure uninstall the 1070 Ti device before shutting down swapping cards. Everything has been working perfectly. However I just realized that I can no longer get into the damn BIOS! It will be black screen for few seconds then boot the windows login screen. I have tried pressing Del or F2 keys very quickly holding down as soon as I see the lights on the keyboard turn on. Tried at least 30 times of various ways. I noticed this new card I don't even see the Asus boot up screen where it asks press Del enter BIOS. I have default setting show that for 3 seconds. It showed fine the 1070 Ti. I also tried the UEFI boot via Windows 10 Googling around seems be that certain GPU's don't play nicely the Asus X570 boards. What is even crazier is I have an Asus GPU too. Seems other people have had same issues where they had buy a different GPU then it would work for example this thread Unfortunately I have sold the 1070 Ti already so won't have access another GPU until next weekend. I don't reset the CMOS in case I can't boot into the BIOS as I do need my computer for work this week just in case I can't see BIOS screen. I have also tried swapping Display Ports on the GPU. I have a 3700x of course can't use the onboard Display Port I tried just in case but nothing shows that it is black since the 3700x requires discreet graphics. Also tried a full shut down disconnecting power cable. Holding down power for 5 seconds. Wait 3 minutes do it again then power back on. Hit Del or F2 numerous times or even once every second or other times holding it down but each every time it'll go the damn Windows login screen. This is driving me nuts. Anyone had similar issues before? Thoughts? Edit I have latest 1407 BIOS. Everything was fine until I wanted enter BIOS this new card. Was in the BIOS over 50x last few days before upgrade. Also everything is at Stock no overclocking plenty of cooling in a Fractal Design R4.

I am a Linux enthusiast so I had experimented few different OS on it. Its not surprising me that making use of the screenpad in Linux is not given its a new technology having Linux developers look at it integrate it would have wait till this concept is popular. My problem is once I did format the default system no matter how many times I tried get it back on Windows it keeps creating different issues. I have tried a lot of ways exhausted my mind. I finally have it setup now it works but only after booting. Then I turn of the display once it just stops detecting it completely. If someone could help or advise on this issue I would be appreciate a lot. Thanks in advance.

1,gqlaem,ASUS,0,2020/05/26 15:00:33,Afternoon,Lighting service crashing my pc Hi everyone so the latest update of aura is being really strange. A couple months ago I got a new graphics card PSU so I thought this would be a good time do a Windows reset. I went through the whole process of reinstalling all my software as do then every time I logged in after a few seconds it was always in the same amount of time my pc would completely crash deadlocked not being able do anything. I even struggled get into safe mode this was a problem especially my coursework deadlines coming up all my important files on my pc requiring my pc finish them send them off. I reinstalled windows a few times because of this it would keep happening so I thought it had be a driver or piece of software at this point I didn't think it would be a background service so I eliminated everything on startup that didn't work. I then thought I found a solution but I didn't. This was that wallpaper engine uses high priority on boot which was experimental at this point it would have made sense that this was the problem. So I got rid of the high priority on boot that worked but only for a couple weeks. After these few weeks I decided change up the lighting as I was getting bored of the colour scheme so I load up aura boom... Crashes deadlocked. So I force shut down my pc the problem was back struggling even get past the log on screen without my pc deadlocking. I then found a Reddit thread about this one guy found a solution but I can't find the thread so I thought I would tell everyone keep the problem updated for anyone that hasn't found the solution until there is a fix. Basically there is a folder called lighting service. If manage get into safe mode on windows then - go into your documents or file explorer whatever call it - go your main drive - access program files x86 - delete the folder called LightingService - restart your pc log in normally - search for AURA in the start bar then right click click uninstall - this will take a list of applications will uninstall AURA aura service - once this is done reboot log in normally - reinstall Asus aura follow the download instructions. So far this is working for me. I am not going denounce Asus as it obviously isn't a big enough problem on the scale of how many people are experiencing it but I am disappointed that an application such as aura has such an impact on my pc the point where it is unusable. I hope this helps people out as I struggled finding a solution online so I thought I'd post it myself once I found it. If this turns out be a temporary solution then I shall update this post.

1,gqbe2r,ASUS,4,2020/05/26 05:57:59,Night,Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi issues I built a system an Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi With a SAPPHIRE NITRO RX 5700 XT. I started play Battlefield 5 the game started present a black screen the pc froze no restart no ability restart via windows . Soon afterwards I started have issues while booting. Sometimes the board doesn’t pass the GPU verification white led the board won’t post. When it does sometimes I can play for hours no issues. Thought it was related the graphics card but even a new gpu the same thing happens. Have the latest bios drivers. I have seen other ASUS X570 users the same issues board replacement does not fix the issue as well. In the event viewer there are no errors logged only the kernel failure happens when the mobo suddenly loses power . So it's not a windows or driver issue its a hardware issue. x200B And it's related power since the bizarre problem happens a while on Windows when it crashes the PC but it doesnt reboot it rarely happens . b on the first boot of the day it takes several resets finally boot up the machine. The issue is becoming worse every day. At the beginning 3 resets i could boot up the machine now 6 or 7 I'm still not able boot up the machine. c once it boots I can run heavy duty games no hassles. Before I had frequent crashes in BF5 but after some tweeks on the power options of windows it stopped crashing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- x200B UPDATE I found the issue. On my MB I have the following layout X570 TUF layout So the green connectors are mandatory connectors the red one is optional go crazy on extreme overclock. My Corsair 750X had these cables Corsair PSU 750X 850X connectors I was sharing a 12v 6 pin connector feed my 5700x. Also the 2 pin that merges into the 4 pin do a 6 pin connector for the graphics card is a bit flimsy. You have connect first the 2 pin connector then the 4 pin one onto the GPU. This is because the 4 pin connector has a small plastic that holds the 2 pin connector in place. So connect otherwise the 2 pin can break lose from the GPU connector can cause these type of problems. Also I removed the additional 4 pin 12v connector from the motherboard connected 2 individual 6 pin cables the PSU connected each one the gpu. No issues now. Maybe this was a noob mistake since this is my first machine after being retired for the last 10 years but still I managed follow some instincts before starting send parts RMA.

I've tried a different PSU I've turned off every fan but the sound is still there. Has anyone else experienced this? Also I only successfully boot 60-70% of the time as well. Lots of errors that are reserved for future error codes. I'll be calling their support tomorrow set up an RMA.

I could easily get into the BIOS by holding down F2 for a while but today it stopped working. I held down F2 while powering on get into BIOS but I was greeted a black screen. So I restarted by the power button let it start as it should it did perfectly without any hiccups. But from then on I can't access the BIOS No BIOS wasn't updating then . It gets stuck there at the black screen when I trying get into BIOS. I left it at the black screen for 30 mins but nothing happened. The internal fans keyboard lighting were all working fine but I couldn't see anything on the display. I hooked up an external display repeated the same but nothing showed up in the external monitor. Then I removed the pre-installed m.2 ssd from the board put another blank ssd in it it booted it. It came the BIOS page as usual. But I can't access it without putting a blank drive. My laptop boots up perfectly functions well without getting into BIOS but it stays at the black screen during the BIOS. I need rearrange the boot order but I can't do it. I reset the setting in the BIOS while the blank ssd but that didn't fix it either. I am at a complete loss here. Please help me out.

I just got this new laptop ASUS TUF Gaming A15 AMD Ryzen 7 4800H Processor RAM 8 GB / Storage 512 GB SSD Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6 GB Full HD screen / 144 Hz Battery life Up 7 hours x200B x200B I made sure do detailed research before purchasing but now I'm not getting the performance as advertised. On Fortnite I expected my frames be well over 144fps so I could make proper use of the 144Hz. This assumption was backed up by numerous videos showing a streaming fps of around 110 at epic setting. I turned down my setting low cause I always play on low but the performance did not improve at all. The fps was unstable even dropping down 80 fps at some points. I have updated all the drivers windows as well as following multiple tutorials on youtube on optimising my laptop Nvidia control panel settings. Nothing seems be improving the frames performance. Please advise what I can do. I have noticed a lot of Asus software running in the background e.g. Asus software manager . Is there a way stop it from running maybe improve performance?

I am absolutely in love this system. I was at first unsure about the whole “mesh WiFi ” idea I had tried a couple of systems that didn’t live up my expectations was about go back my trusty AirPort Extreme when I happened come across the ASUS ZenWiFi CT8 whole-home mesh wifi system. Now I will admit it was purely the design of these things that I fell in love first followed by its impressive list of features some pretty impressive specifications. Just looking at the box this system comes in just know ’re getting a quality item inside. The box itself is simply gorgeous... I’d actually be sad throw it away. Inside I was greeted by two identical routers well-protected in form-fitted egg crate packaging. Interestingly there was no manual included none could be found online either. They did include a poster-sized quick guide that should get going but it won’t help anything else. Nonetheless the interface is pretty familiar know Asus routers their awesome User-friendly firmware. And can go online find manuals for similar routers that will help a lot. These routers are gorgeous. I really love the look of the sleek black finish the brushed-metal texture. Picking one of the units up I was impressed the weight of it. Shining a light inside the vents I could see some substantial metal heatsinks inside which gives the product some good heft. And the silicone base covers the entire bottom of the unit keeping it firmly in place safe from sliding or tipping over. The air vents are attractive well-designed for maximum air flow keep these powerful routers cool. The power adapters are very small light resemble iPad chargers. The Velcro strap that’s on the power cable keep it tidy is a nice touch. Setting up the system was very straightforward only took about 10 minutes get fully up running. You have the option set the system up either through a web browser interface or the Asus Router App your iOS or Android device. I tried both methods although they look slightly different visually both methods accomplished the same result. Basically they’ve made the setup process almost automatic only prompting enter a user name password an SSID. I appreciated that they’ve included the option split my WiFi network into three SSIDs so I can control which devices connect my 2.4ghz band which would be better served by the faster 5ghz bands. Once everything was all set I was stunned at the speeds of the wireless backhaul. When I tried a speed test the units about 20 feet apart I reached speeds of around 350Mbps which I thought was quite impressive. But I have Ethernet cables running throughout the home so I was able connect them hard wired get the full speed I pay for from my ISP which is 600mbps. I get this speed all over my house yard I love that my phone signal never gets dropped as I move from one point another. The aiMesh roaming capabilities are impressive seems work flawlessly almost always keeping me on the closest node giving me the best experience possible. Even around 35 devices on my network both wired wireless I just can’t seem trip up this system at all. I even tried streaming high definition AND 4K video on every display in the house simultaneously - 11 video streams - still couldn’t break the ZenWiFi. It didn’t even buffer the videos at all there was no degradation or skipping of the picture whatsoever. I was very impressed this system’s overall performance. I actually loved this system so much that I felt confident enough purchase the wifi 6 version of the ZenWiFi extend my coverage capabilities even more. To my surprise they were recognized incorporated into the system as soon as I plugged them in. Now I have the benefits of WiFi 6 802.11ax it works my existing system seamlessly I love that. Who is this system for? I think this system would be perfect for homeowners or small business owners who are looking for a truly set-it--forget-it Home Networking experience while still having the advanced configuration options power users need. It’s also a great system for those who need the flexibility add their system as their WiFi requirements grow. And ’re looking for a mesh WiFi system that delivers your true maximum internet speed pretty consistently then this system is for . Mine is 600mbps I often get 650 on WiFi. And since are getting two identical powerful routers in one box ’re getting excellent value for your money as well. I think ASUS has hit it out of the park the ZenWiFi system. And the two year warranty I expect these provide years of trouble-free WiFi. I hope enjoyed my review found it helpful!

Only months ago I had literally no clue what WiFi 6 was let alone a “mesh”... I certainly had no idea I would soon be on the search for the a new WiFi system... And upgrading my phone... And my internet plan... basically in the process of future-proofing my home networking gear kick off the 2020s in WiFi style. And the growing number of smart devices being added my network on a regular basis I came realize that a mesh WiFi system was something I should consider when looking at my next WiFi solution. In this review I will explain why I made the decision upgrade my WiFi why I chose this particular system out of a muddled sea of choices. So why did I feel the need upgrade my Wifi? I was perfectly happy the trusty AirPort Extreme which still worked perfectly had stellar WiFi 5 wireless coverage provided amazing speeds. Long story short WiFi 6 is why. The latest standard in WiFi. Well I pondered my own situation for a moment came the conclusion that maybe it was time retire my AirPort which is almost 10 years old. I first looked Apple but unfortunately they’ve decided exit the home networking industry are now just recommending any mesh system Mu-Mimo/OFDMA. Now I had no clue what a mesh system or any of that even was. But the more I learned about it the more I realized that WiFi 6 whole-home mesh system was the way of the future that’s where I wanted go my own home network situation. So how did I decide which mesh system get? There were about a half dozen contenders available that seemed suit my needs but the ones I really wanted were way out of my price range. I learned really quickly that I wasn’t going get the speeds I was looking for unless I adjusted my budget accordingly. With these new mesh systems definitely get what pay for in terms of raw performance but I decided look in the mid-range of the mesh system lineup. So I narrowed my search down a few flagship WiFi 6-capable offerings from a few top brands. Lucky for me my search quickly ended when I found the ASUS ZenWiFi XT8 whole-home mesh WiFi system. So I purchased a set I can’t wait share my experience. Spoiler alert... I love it!!! First of all the design was the number one thing that attracted me this system. I was immediately struck by the beautiful charcoal finish of the ASUS ZenWiFi routers I was really intrigued by the possibility of incredible WiFi speeds through the dedicated 5GHz wireless backhaul. I also needed a system that accommodates the ability expand as my network grows... This system strikes the right balance between price value for what get. It’s a very high quality piece of equipment can tell right away when get them in your hands. To me they were worth every penny. Each router is about 6 inches wide by 7 inches tall 3 inches deep. So they are a pretty decent size but not terribly huge like some others. Accompanying the routers is a basic but informative easy understand quick-start guide. I was disappointed that they didn’t include a user manual this system neither could I find one online. But the user interface is familiar there are manuals for similar models that will help. Underneath the routers we find a single Ethernet cable two 19w charging adapters. The charging adapters cords feel well-made come a Velcro strap on each one for cord management. On the bottom of the routers we have a fully non-slip base the weight of the giant heatsinks inside these units ensures they won’t easily be tipped over or pulled. I really love the way these routers look... I think they’re just gorgeous I think they would suit just about any decor. They can be proudly displayed on a shelf or hidden among books or picture frames without drawing too much attention. They come in two colours white charcoal black. And although I think they look great in white I really wanted get the Charcoal ones. But these were impossible find at the time of purchase so I settled on white. That being said I was pleasantly surprised how beautiful they looked when I actually saw them in person. The plastic has a modern brushed metal texture it even has subtle hints of sparkle on the surface which I think is a nice touch. The top has a decal an interesting 3D texture it as well. On the front near the bottom we have a single white LED which can shut off in the settings prefer. The LED colour indicates the router’s status lets know of any problems. On the back of the router we have a 2.5G Wan port which is unheard-of on most high end routers let alone a mesh router! And we also we have four 1G LAN Ports which can be used connect devices or a switch can be used connect many more devices. A USB 3 port is included can be used for printer sharing or connecting an external hard drive for personal cloud storage. I can even do Time Machine on my Mac this router. The setup process was incredibly easy. I simply plugged in the power cord connected one of the routers my ISP’s modem brought the second router close the first one for the setup process downloaded opened the router app from there the App pretty much took over. All I had do was follow a few prompts. The router initially created its own setup WiFi which the router app then connected facilitating a perfectly streamlined automatic setup process. It only took a few minutes. At this point I was given the option name my WiFi network I was even given the option separate the WiFi bands into separate SSIDs I wanted which is a feature not found on a lot of mesh routers. At this point the node is automatically set up as well that the network was all set ready use. You can bet first thing I did was check my WiFi speed. Incredible! I had recheck it since I didn’t believe it at first. But yes... I was seeing download speeds of 740mbps! On WiFi! On my own little private miniature cell network! Even as I moved from one end of the house the other it seamlessly connected me the closest node! I was truly impressed see true wired speeds on my WiFi network. I easily reached 700 Mbps in all corners of my home. It’s amazing. And I didn’t even plug in the Ethernet cables I had running all over my house. So I thought why not connect them all by Ethernet test the wired backhaul performance. It so happens that Ethernet backhaul frees up the second 5GHz band for use by devices! This is a huge advantage over some other systems which don’t have this option because now I have a total of three SSIDs connect making my network faster more efficient by selecting which band is suitable for a particular device. Smart connect seems work beautifully automatically steering traffic connections the appropriate bands ensuring a solid consistent WiFi experience all day long never dropping a connection. But I chose disable dual-band smart connect because I personally prefer choose which band is best suited for a particular device. Whether it’s through the app or through the web interface this router is rife configuration options. You can adjust fine tune settings just the way like any other router. A lot of mesh systems have an overly-simplified interface which can be frustrating for someone who wants fine turn their system their liking. The ZenWiFi system lets choose a simplified interface or a more advanced option which tinkerers will appreciate. When open the app get a visual overview of your network a clear visual picture of how the network is structured sharp colourful graphics a ton of menu options. All the information pertinent your network is available at-a-glance at any time anywhere are in the world. All the connected devices are listed can do many things personalize your network such as creating user profiles for family members limiting bandwidth or blocking certain websites for certain users or devices. Restrict internet access certain times set bedtimes for the kids’ WiFi. With free lifetime online protection can be sure the network is safe from malicious attacks viruses intrusion which many other router manufacturers charge for. And just a few clicks I can adjust settings for all my wireless bands enable or disable wireless backhaul add more nodes check track internet bandwidth usage manage my cloud storage my external connected hard drive...even add a vpn. Finally I feel better knowing that the app will notify me of new device connections suspicious activity firmware updates. Staying on top of those important things is something that’s not easy on other systems. Although the app is impressive it is quite buggy for a mature firmware platform. I found several little quirks oddities throughout the interface that hindered the experience sometimes even required a full factory reset. Sometimes when I make a change a setting apply it the system simply reboots ignores my wishes lets me believe it changed the setting when really nothing actually happened. For example when I disable the switch for wireless backhaul the router reboots the wireless backhaul remains enabled the switch turns back on. Although un-hiding the 5GHz-2 SSID opens the third band for use there is really no way shut off the wireless backhaul there’s no option for 160MHz channels a feature I expected be available on this system based on early reviews I saw. I also tried turning down the radio transmit power experiment my cell size the setting actually seemed do nothing affect the transmitting power. Another frustration was when I wanted dedicate the third 5GHz band WiFi 6 mobile phones exclusively by enabling the “AX Only” option. But changing it AX Only didn’t seem work as expected because non-WiFi 6 devices were still able connect even AX Only enabled. Some settings just seem be for show really do nothing at all simply rebooting. Although it does says it’s applying the changes I made the results are hit-or-miss. But despite its many quirks the interface is actually very good. Just like any other ASUS router interface. And most important it just works. So who do I recommend this for? This is not a system for everyone. The XT8 is a mid-range mesh system meant for folks who a balance of speed ease of use value for the dollar. It’s best suited for home or business owners who wish stay on the cutting edge of new technology future-proof their small networks. But there is an early adopter’s tax for WiFi 6 as it is still a fledgling standard WiFi 5 continuing exceed the needs of most people these days it’s hard justify the higher investment in WiFi 6 when there are adequate WiFi 5 systems that will do the job at half the cost of a WiFi 6 system. So for those more modest wireless networking needs I’d recommend the ASUS ZenWiFi CT8 mesh system instead which is sure be more than enough for 99% of people’s current future needs. But ’re paying for gigabit internet access wish realize those incredible speeds consistently on your WiFi 6 devices this system can do it all day long in the right conditions. For me the ASUS XT8 Whole Home Mesh WiFi system has worked perfectly it just hits all the right notes so it gets my enthusiastic recommendation. I couldn’t be happier it. I hope found my review helpful!

In the last 10 years the quality of there product's have gone so down hill! I bought a 3000 laptop that stopped working just after a year a half of proper use. The customer service following that absolutely terrible. Alongside the ridiculous repair quotes. Then I look into the forums on Reddit other online resources see a shared opinion not by just a few people but almost everyone!! It's sad how corporate development has such a negative effect on a business. Killing off loyal fans but maintaining the bottom line because there is just so many people in the world now the company is big enough portray quality that leads making enough off the ignorant. I'd love find smaller company's that still hold traditional values create quality products. I don't think I'm going give Asus anymore of my money even get this repaired. I'll take a 3k loss move on. Any suggestions?

I have a pet peeve always have the latest drivers installed. Naturally the drivers are outdated on the official Asus Downloads page as usual. Took over an hour track down all the latest drivers. Latest drivers for the Asus X570-Plus AMD Chipset Realtek Ethernet Realtek Audio - UAD Note1 X570-Plus Follow instructions for ASUS PRIME/TUF DTS Custom motherboards Note2 My understanding is UAD is newebetter but must have a Windows 10 flavor that can use the Microsoft Store. IE Windows 10 Education won't work so then will have go the HDA driver. Please correct me I'm wrong! Realtek Audio - HDA Note Use this do not have Microsoft Store on your Windows 10 or using super old builds of Windows 10.

1,gpdtz3,ASUS,1,2020/05/24 14:15:11,Afternoon,Need help! ASUS Q535UD Laptop won't boot! Hi I've noticed lately that I'm having trouble getting my ASUS Q535UD laptop boot up. The lights on the side like the power button the one next the battery icon the squiggly lightning inside it are both lit up but the cylinder shaped icon doesn't blink indicating any activity. It does this sporadically. Sometimes I plug in the power cord within a few minutes it boots up. Sometimes I have literally unscrew the back lid take out the battery from the inside plug in the power cord boot up then replug in the battery. It always boots up when I resort the worst case scenario last step. It's a royal pain getting this thing opened. I already went ahead purchased a new battery just in case I need it in the future. I got this laptop in Nov 2018. I use it alllll the time for 3-5 hours a day or more. Sometimes I use it as a Plex server google street view or google earth that's really the only time I hear the fan blowing unless it's 90 degrees outside which can't be helped but I'm not doing serious gaming on it or photoshop etc. I replaced the HDD it came all of my drives are SSD. So I know it's not a drive failure. I THINK but I'm not sure it's the battery that needs be replaced but I just find it strange that I would need a battery this soon. I thought batteries lasted 1000 charge cycles or 2 4 years. I did a battery report it says I only charged this 137 times. I'm just incredibly worried that it's something that will cost me a small fortune fix bc I don't have get this laptop replaced. I love this laptop. It's the nicest one I've ever owned I already threw down so much money on it. If I took it UBreakIFix would they charge me look at the laptop? If anyone has any suggestions or can give me an educated guess as what the problem is please let me know. My product is out of warranty as well. Is it worth it get an Asus Warranty extension? Ideally I this laptop last me 5 years or more...

Hello everyone recently my UX433FA's keyboard is behaving extremely weird starting from repeated key presses key pressing on its own key not registered when being pressed this recent anomaly. The 'B' key some other keys was registered as another keypress I included a video where this happened. When I press the 'B' key the Ctrl key was registered. when I spammed it finally the 'B' key registered. oh also recently the spacebar doesn't register x200B All these anomalies come go randomly so on one day I can use the laptop just fine on another I was figuring out how control my keyboard like a caveman. Those anomalies almost cost me my exam during my online exam my down arrow key started pressing on its own I couldn't scroll back up since it's spamming the key. All these behavior started when I stopped using my laptop for a week I turned it off not sleep for a week. When I turned it on its like the keyboard caught covid-19. I tried use an external keyboard see the problem is software related it functions fine an external keyboard. I also tried the laptop keyboard in BIOS at that time I was testing the right arrow key since it was unresponsive it wasn't responsive in the BIOS too . I tried reinstalling windows 10 used the laptop in Ubuntu 20.04 in both case the problem isn't solved. My BIOS version currently is 309 I also updated my touchpad drivers etc through MyASUS software. I purchased the laptop in August 2019 so the laptop is almost 10 months old now. I'm planning take it a nearby ASUS Service Center try RMA it or replace the keyboard. This is driving me nuts anyone have any idea what caused this or what can be done before I take it a service center?

Still useable at the moment. I have the GPU under warranty as I bought it fall of last year so it's under warranty I have it registered. So now the RTX 2070 has been replaced the 2070 Super. What are the chances that Asus sends me a direct replacement? And also do they give the option get a different GPU lets say 2080 Super can pay the difference? How does the process work exactly? Thankss!

So this was solved I would really appreciate the link. Thank guys. So this is my problem. About one year ago I bought an Asus N580GD. I don't use it for gaming well sometimes haha . Basically I use it for Lightroom Premiere Atlas.ti an the office suite. About two days ago Windows upload some updates. Unfortunately I don't remember which ones. It wasn't a big one that's for sure. After that some software start fail. Adobe Premiere Zoom Discord PowerPoint wasn't work because of the microphone. In the case of Premiere all the audio wasn't working. So after trying every solution I found on internet I chose reinstall windows. After that everything went super wrong. SUPER WRONG. Long story short the battery went crazy. The battery have a design capacity of 48.105 mWh. And the full charge capacity went down 14.830 mWh. I noted that something went wrong after install Windows 10 because the laptop shut down sudenlly like 40% of battery. I tried some solutions I found on the web but nothing worked. Except for one. I calibrated the battery manually. I monitored the charging using command prompt cmd powercfg/batteryreport . The 100% battery was about 14.830 mWh. And then because no reason the battery report marked 260% of battery about 38.000 mWh. Then I unplug the laptop use it until the battery was totally discharged. Then I charge it again until the super 260-266%. Everything seems fine in that moment. That was yesterday. And today my laptop about 40% of charge shut down again. And the battery marked 1%. Now the 100% is about 23.608 mWh. And now after curse the charger it marks 173% a total of 41.000 mWh. Maybe is the charger? It seems that Asus Battery Health Charging doesn't for this model N580GD . I really don't know what else do. And will understand that it is difficult leave the house in these times. I hope someone can help me here. I need your wisdom guys. Please! I added som images the battery report Thank guys!!! x200B x200B

Whenever i restart the laptop it doesnt boot back instead the screen just remains black while the keyboard's backlight the fans work. The only way get out of this state is by holding down the power button for 5 seconds. Although this does the trick forcing shutdown whenever i boot up my pc is bad both for my hard disk battery. Is there anyway I can prevent this issue from happening whenever I restart or is a hardware issue? Thanks in advance.

1,gommml,ASUS,2,2020/05/23 08:34:11,Morning,Can I install the “Asus TUF Z390 — Pro Gaming” BIOS on the “Asus TUF Z390 — Plus Gaming WiFi ” motherboard? If look at the Drivers Tools page specific for my motherboard — Asus TUF Z390 — Plus Gaming WiFi — ’ll see that the most recent BIOS is v2606 released on November 1st 2019. However I accidentally pulled up the wrong product page earlier when looking for the board I have came across the “Pro Gaming” version I have the “Plus Gaming” which has a more recent BIOS release — v2804 released on May 15th 2020. You can see that page here — Asus TUF Z390 — Pro Gaming I guess it’s possible that they’re working their way towards releasing a new BIOS for my specific board. maybe it’ll be released in the next few days but I can’t imagine there’s that much different between the “Pro” “Plus” Gaming boards. The only concern I had was that the BIOS for the “Pro” version wouldn’t have the instruction set for WiFi but I use Ethernet-only my computer so I wouldn’t be upset I lost it. Regardless I just wanted know it would brick my board or not. If ’re wondering why I’m so seemingly antsy flash my BIOS it’s because I’ve had a not-fucking-fun-time the current BIOS release Build 2606 has been a nightmare for me. Thanks in advance!

3,godo27,ASUS,7,2020/05/22 21:54:46,Evening,Zephyrus S Poor Thermals My Zephyrus model is pretty much underperforming on the cpu-power field due bad cooling. This thing's 3 months old so definitely not dust on the heatsinks. When taking a load cores 0 2 just overheat all the way up 95 degrees then it gets throttled down while the other 4 cores are down at 78-86C. Even turbo disabled cores 0 2 are at 85C while the rest of the cores are at 75C. While Idle they all sit at about 59-63C I feel like this thing needs a repaste but I can't really go a service center during quarantine.

1,goghm3,ASUS,0,2020/05/23 01:57:53,Night,Scar II GL504GS weird fan behaviour Copy pasting this from asus forums because nobody replied me there oof So I have a Scar II recently I noticed that the fans do not spin enough on overboost. This resulsts in the GPU CPU both reaching 90C when playing relatively light games. Here's the weird part - when I set the fans silent BOTH the GPU CPU temps drop by around 10C !!!! in around 10 seconds while the fans dont seem change speed. After a while the temperatures slowly catch up the 90C from before. Is it possible that Silent reduced GPU CPU TDP? But it gets weirder. When I set it back overboost the fans start properly ramping up now on normal overboost speed instead of the previous overboost speed but after a few seconds they ramp back down. This is a recent software issue because I know the cooling system is more than capable of keeping both the CPU GPU cool because the fans do not spin as fast as they used . The only time they spin fast is when i switch overboost from silent but they ramp back down anyway after a few minutes. If it matters I have a 90mV undervolt which reduced the CPU TDP by around 10W under load but I still get crappy temps because the fans dont spin. EDIT Are there any programs that allow manual fan control for this laptop? I tried speedfan it doesn't detect anything.

Because of this I need go through the ASUS RMA process. I tried creating an RMA claim through the web portal in an incognito window when I click submit I get a response that my Serial Number Undefined already has an RMA ticket open Undefined . Because I was having trouble opening an online RMA I decided call the support number listed for motherboards on the support site I attempted call the 1-812 number at 4 30 PM Central time or 2 30 PST which falls between 8AM 6PM PST however I do not hear a ringer I am disconnected after 2 seconds. What is the best way get in contact ASUS issue an RMA request? Edit I just attempted fill out the RMA on my phone. When I hit submit on the RMA form I got a Connection Failed dialog box. Up until this point I've only had positive experiences ASUS. But the frustration I'm finding getting in contact RMA personel not even the RMA process is making me seriously consider cutting my losses simply purchasing an MSI product.

Recently purchased a new ASUS TUF Gaming laptop FA506-II. Unfortunately it's been giving me some serious trouble screen flicker. It can be present infrequently while I have it plugged in but it is most noticeable when it is running off battery power. Switching 60hz from 144hz seems make it less frequent but it still occurs. I've tried all the standard solutions that are out there for screen flicker issues but nothing seems help. As far as I can tell the flicker does not occur in safe mode but it does occur in all windows OS screens in normal boot mode. I've contacted ASUS they've offered have it picked up for an assessment but I have a feeling maybe it's just the laptop's power not being able keep up the screen. I'll probably send it in regardless but I was wondering anyone out there has had any similar issues or knowledge about what settings are making the difference here make this no longer an issue?

Hey all I've recently just built my computer sometimes I keep getting an issue where there is an Orange DRAM light lit on the the motherboard the nothing happens. My AMD Ryzen 3700X GeForce 2060 SUPER G SKill Trident 3600 MHZ all turn on except the computer does not. I've tried resetting the BIOS by putting a flat screw in CLRTC pins cleaning testing each ram stick installed all the drivers listed from the ARMORY CRATE. In addition I can't even get the BIOS. I've noticed some people have had the same issue in other subreddits there still seems be no fixes. Is there anybody facing the same issue found a way around this or do I need replace my ramsticks or motherboard?
1,gntuq8,ASUS,0,2020/05/22 01:43:53,Night,Need some help an Asus X470 build I need help a build I am helping a friend . I am having an issue a Ryzen 3600x build Asus X470 Cross hair hero Vii. The issue is that the USB header from Corsairs CPU block plugged in the system will not post. The graphics card fans spin up then spin back down spin up again. The post indicator goes crazy does not settle on a post code. With the USB header on the cpu block NOT plugged in the build posts fine boots windows fine. Ofc we can't control the pump speed or fan speed from windows without that USB header plugged in. If we plug in the USB header while booted into windows corsairs Icue software detects the AIO we can control it. However we restart it will not post until we remove the USB cable. The USB cable is plugged into a USB header on the motherboard the only header not a Corsair fan hub because we don't have one. We've already installed latest bios X470 chipsets USB drivers through windows control panel. I'm inclined think it's the AIOs problem not the board but I'm curious anyone here has run into something like this.

1,gnqm02,ASUS,6,2020/05/21 20:59:38,Evening,Replacing Graphics Card on Asus Vivobook Please excuse this computer noob here. I know a bit but not much so please explain things in a somewhat simple way. As much as I would love buy a nice desktop setup I don't have the money probably won't for a very long time since I'm on a temporarily lay off until god knows when. I really play The Witcher 2 but so far it's not running well on my Asus Vivobook I'm aware the game is more demanding than TW1 according a friend the rest of my specs on my laptop are fine I just need a new graphics card. He said I could get a cheaper one for around 100 give or take. My questions are 1. Is it even possible switch out my graphics card on this laptop so can I do it on my own without likely breaking it? 2. If the answer question 1 is yes where can I get a good decently priced graphics card that will fit this? 3. Or scrap questions 1 2 tell me that just upgrading the graphics card in this laptop is not going run TW2 any better. Here are the specs Manufacturer ASUSTek Computer Inc. Processor Intel R Core TM i5-8250U CPU 1.60GHz 1.80GHz Installed Memory RAM 8.00 GB 7.89 GB usable System Type 64-bit Operating System x64-based processor Graphics Card Intel R UHD Graphics 620

I'm already really frustrated that this 4 week old product has issues. ASUS claim that I have damaged my X-470F motherboard won't even look at the issue until I pay 385CND for the repair. The M2 cover plate stems are the issue apparently? First this is unrelated my actually startup hardware issues. Second I unscrewed screwdriver stems came right off the mount it is therefore defective. Third why would I pay this I can buy the same board at significantly LESS price than this price in CND ? I had go back the ASUS chat where they have escalated this the repair centre again. If I get push back on having repair their crap defective M.2 mounts I'm really going lose it. x200B x200B 
1,gnnl2h,ASUS,2,2020/05/21 17:30:19,Afternoon,Samsung M.2 SSD 970 Evo Plus not detected in BIOS I recently purchased a M.2 SSD 500GB for my TUF FX 504 where I would like install my OS then replace the stock 1TB HDD a 2TB HDD. The problem is that my SSD isn't showing up in the Boot Tab of the BIOS but is recognized in the Advanced Options NVMe Configuration . What should I do fix this? I've also considered using Samsung's Data Migration Tool migrate from the HDD the M.2 SSD but does that entail completely wiping my 1TB HDD then migrating whatever is left which would be my OS onto the SSD? I'll provide more detail as needed. Update Looks like everything is working now. To fix my SSD not showing in the boot tab of my BIOS I opted in get a fresh installation of windows on my HDD includes wiping it completely then using Samsung Data Migration Tool migrate my OS from HDD SSD. Once completed I restarted my laptop accessed my BIOS where my drives then appeared on the Boot Tab enabling me set my SSD as my 1 Boot Drive. Also I'm not sure this had an impact but might consult this video by pre-LinusTechTips about enabling your drives.
1,gnmlgv,ASUS,0,2020/05/21 16:28:32,Afternoon,Asus Zephyrus G15 Liquid Metal repaste. Thermal design is a huge disappointment After using this laptop for about a week it is clear me that this laptop runs HOT. CPU temperature on idle can be anywhere between 50-60 C under full load the 4800HS can easily hit over 100 C. And the GPU temperature is not looking good either hovering around 80-86 while gaming 87 C is the maxium limit this GPU is allowed hit . And of course the fan is loud constantly spinning. So I decided open it up gave it a repaste liquid metal today. And the result is incredibly disappointing... basically nothing change! I believe the laptop is already at it thermal design limitation there's nothing could do improve it unless open the air vent void your warranty . For comparison my Alienware 17R5 temperature drop by 20 C after I repasted it liquid metal.

1,gnl54v,ASUS,2,2020/05/21 15:02:44,Afternoon,Issue a new Zen 2 build Hey I just build a new PC based on a Ryzen 7 3800X an ASUS ROG Strix X570-F Gaming. Everything seems be working fine one exception VGA display. The first time I booted the PC my screens were showing “no signal” / turning off / showing “no signal” etc. in a loop. I had force shutdown it unplug the graphic card an RTX 2080 Super boot the PC without it once then re-plug it boot it again have it working. I got an error message telling me that the VGA adapter was incompatible ???? that it automatically changed some settings I did not write exactly the message sadly . Then when I boot my PC everything works fine my displays are working. But I reboot my PC well this time I have nothing on my screens the PC won’t event boot the same “no signal” loop . The “VGA” LED is on on the motherboard. I have force shutdown my PC then boot it it’s fine. Obviously very annoying when PC reboots when updating Windows for example. Is there a known issue around that? Any idea what could cause that? The GPU is not at fault because it’s behaving properly on an other build Ryzen 7 1700X an other ASUS motherboard . EDIT I have updated the BIOS in case there were some bugs that might have been fixed since manufacturing but no avail.

The lights on the ram are on so I know they work but they are not recognized by armoury crate at all. Is there something I could possibly change in the bios of my B450-F mobo help this? I tried completely remove armoury crate but I couldn’t figure out how so I decided do a complete reinstall of windows wipe my SSD where the program was installed. That didn’t help. I tried switching the slots the ram is in but keeping dual channel that didn’t work either. Any help would be appreciated. I have yet contact ASUS support but will do that soon.

2,gn0xuq,ASUS,5,2020/05/20 16:28:34,Afternoon,ASUS WTFast Promotion a Scam also their customer service is horrible deal  TLDR Do not buy their video cards in anticipation of receiving the 6 month WTFast subscription may God have mercy on your soul have deal their customer service. My Experience Purchased an Asus 2070 Super in December the 6 month subscription WTFast promotion being a key factor in the purchase. I went through all the steps redeem the subscription which includes pulling your video card back out of PC find a tiny PPID that they need a picture of above beyond serial numbers proof of purchase etc . Although a bit of process could do all that in 15-30 minutes. A code was sent within a week or so redeem on the WTFast site which I did the time was added. Except that it was a 14 day subscription not a 6 month subscription as was advertised. I contacted WTFast the response was that the codes are pre generated sent ASUS that they sent me a 14 day code. Although frustrating seemed legit. So off I go ASUS. Starting their online chat service this required several separate chats before a legit ticket could be made they asked me reapply for the subscription. Which lead no record of redemption . So the email game began. Over 30 back forth emails have now been sent for about 2 months. During this time Have dealt 8 different people had at least 15 different case numbers assigned for future reference I have been asked provide an invoice at least 8 times. Provide screenshots of the error which every time I have told them there is not an error they gave me the wrong code 6 times Provide the serial number or PPID twice above the 5 times I have applied on the website Received cut paste messages about my video card or warranty issues a few times Told my video card was purchased in new zealand I live purchased the video card in North America not eligible for NA service told I had not provided necessary information the information in the previous emails being replied Literally every person I have dealt through these emails well over 10 has either not read what I have wrote not gone through the notes or quite simply does not seem understand the issue no regard for trying figure it out. Even compiling every single case number every person I have been in contact into a single email resulted in please reapply again which I had been directed do several times already . Eventually they got back me a code after I had snapped. I was happy relieved this was all over. Except as I entered the code my computer recognized it immediately. It was the same 14 day code I had already entered almost 3 months ago now. And here we are over 3 months since applying for a 6 month code still no code. What's up ASUS? Are just intentionally trying do everything can make me drop this forget about it absolve fulfilling your marketing promises? Over taxing your customer service the point they can't actually take time read through the case see what issues are without having resort sending cut paste responses things that have already been addressed? Rhetorical questions but this is absolutely ridiculous. If 're going promote something follow through your promises. This experience turned 20 years of loyalty ASUS upside down. I have purchased multiple laptops mother boards video cards other products over the years was always quick use my word of mouth promote ASUS. But now when people ask I'll have talk about the darker side. Let's hope there ends up being some light at the end of it.

1,gn3rz1,ASUS,4,2020/05/20 19:26:13,Evening,Has ASUS repair downgraded my RAM? December last year I sent my Laptop ASUS vivoflip 14 the Asus repair centre. They replaced my motherboard that seemed fix the issues. When I got it back I realised that my laptop has only 4GB of RAM instead of the 8GB originally came . So I contacted the support centre they're claiming it came only 4GB of RAM that they cant help. However the 'service form' states that prior the repair it did have 8GB on the laptop box it says RAM DDR4 4GB 4GB on board . Therefore the laptop should have 8GB total right? Has Asus reduced the amount of RAM in my laptop or does the onboard memory not show up? I be sure before I start calling them being placed on hold for hours. Thanks!

However on ASUS website motherboard compatibility list this motherboard is not listed. Surely being one of the higher end motherboards on this platform should have a feature like this available. Has anyone ran into this? Does this motherboard support this feature it’s just not listed? Does the PLX cause an interference that cause incompatibilities intel vroc? Any information help the progression of this build would be greatly appreciated. Thank best regards.

I have noticed that I am now getting a white VGA light on my mother board occasionally my bios wont prompt but my comp will still start up.

However now it has just stopped. My issue is the battery is dead so I can't try any software fixes it also doesn't run while plugged in the power cord connected.

I've build a new computer the following specs Processor i9-9900K Mainboard Asus Maximus XI Hero 2x this set - Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x 8GB DDR4-3200 DIMM 288 RTX 2070 If I try start the computer all four RAM-Slots populated I'll get the errorcode b1 or maybe 61 I might not read it correctly . Before it shows this errorcode it reboots a few times in a relatively short periode of time . If I use just 2 sticks of ram it won't make any trouble start the system. Also I can use any two sticks in any slots it does work I saw the correct positioning in the user manuel of the mainboard tried this a few times . In the UEFI I disabled XMP but it doesn't make any difference. It's my first build using four sticks of ram. So my question is do I have do something special in order make it working? I'm hoping there are some pro-tips from the community around this issue. EDIT I've ordered some new sticks but this time they worked as intented. It looks like the other sticks had hardware issues.
3,gm9u2a,ASUS,2,2020/05/19 12:46:21,Morning,ASUS in my experience tries very hard weasel out of warranties This is just my own experience Bought an ASUS chromebook from costco within a year the automatic ASUS warranty period it simply stopped being able charge. After checking the ASUS website I quickly found that this is a common issue that can generally be fixed by hard resetting the chromebook which is already rather dubious. Unfortunately by the time I noticed the issue it was already fully drained could not be reset. Seeing that the product was still in the warranty period i contacted ASUS customer support was informed that for some reason they had my serial number dated a purchase in 2018. As proof of purchase they continued demand a valid invoice from costco containing certain details about the order. The issue is that ASUS policy seems be that for a valid proof of purchase the provided invoice/receipt must include the serial/model number. In the United States distributors like Costco NEVER include the serial number in any invoice instead using their own records item number . This ended up being a massive pain in the ass going back forth between costco asus customer service reps. What's appalling me is that there exists such a ridiculous disconnect between these two companies despite costco selling numerous asus products that the burden of solving this ridiculous miscommunication between these companies lies entirely on the consumer at least in my case. TLDR I would not recommend buying ASUS products from costco or any other warehouse type companies that know don't provide the serial number in the invoice it's important note that I do not blame costco for this because in most cases this information is not required for validating a warranty .

Just sold my google Wifi system because even though coverage it was decent I needed more Ethernet ports on the main router in the office. So I decided on the ASUS. GT-AC5300. I add a second AIMesh compatible router. I would it be the cheapest I can get. So my questions My AC5300 is Triband From my understanding on AI mesh on a triband router I can dedicate 1 of the 5.0ghz networks as the dedicated backhaul. But then does my 2nd “mesh” router also need be Triband dedicate one of its 5.0ghz networks as backhaul too? What my second Asus AIMesh “node” is only dual band will it use the its only 5.0ghz band for the backhaul then place all of my devices on that side of the house connected its 2.4ghz?

As it did for me it tried update it WITHOUT the BIOS being updated 308 beforehand which resulted in a BSOD a keyboard that no longer works. So see MyASUS trying update ROG KB Firmware Update tool 2.2.4 DON'T LET IT at least until flash your BIOS the new 308 version. Since this is a firmware problem using restore point or any reset function in Windows didn't help. I flashed my BIOS 308 afterwards even after updating the hotfix trough MyASUS it still doesn't work... Pretty reckless move on Asuses part hopefully they'll be able fix it without telling people send in their laptop. I've already read multiple people reporting the same thing happening them on the official ROG forums.

My laptop was purchased a little less than a year ago. Whenever I update my laptop sometimes completely randomly my laptop will get stuck on the ASUS In Search of Incredible logo screen. The loading circle/icon will continue spin constantly the mouse cursor will be show up move use the trackpad eventually when it does end it will just go a black screen where the power button will have be held down shut it off start the process over again. I can even hear my bluetooth headphones sync while it's stuck on the ASUS logo screen. This repeats about 2-3 times before it finally gets my lock screen I can enter my laptop. When I try update it will show the windows update screen for a little bit before going the screen going black the issue above starts. Again other times it will just happen without even updating it. The laptop's fingerprint sensor also seems have issues as well but works well apart from that. Does anyone know this is a software problem? A driver problem? Is there any solution this issue? I'm worried about it doing this at an inopportune time. If anyone has encountered a similar issue has an idea for resolving please let me know. Thank .

So I updated my RT-ACRH13 router's firmware Version 3.0.0.4.382.52134 a few days ago ever since then the connection drops randomly. The 5GhZ band disappears completely while the 2.4G band still shows up on the list of networks.

It's been a nearly a decade since I've built a PC so I'm just getting back into the game. The goal here is build something super cheap that can be used for office work web browsing watching videos. I was reading that the current Ryzen chips need a bios update use them. I decided go an A8-9600 chip. Does anyone have any experience these? Am I going need flash the bios just like I would for a Ryzen? Also I was reading through the QVL memory guides on the ASUS website. I was a little confused because these G.Skill Aegis' are listed but these are not. The both seem be the same 288-pin DIMM. I apologize this is a bit of a newbie question- its been awhile. If its not on the QVL does that mean it should work but there's no garuntee that the timings will be correct? Thanks in advance for your guy's help!

Trying get the screen look Normal as in close the color brightness etc of my previous laptop however I am having some issues doing so was wondering I could get any help this here. In Nvidia Control pannel I have two options. Other applications control coller settings This option makes Black look like Grey It makes White look horrible over all looks extremely washed out. This is the setting the monitor started on I can't find any way change it. My other option is use NVIDIA settings. Here however i cannot seem get the Brightness Contrast Gamma balance right look normal not dark not bright. I've tried looking for videos but couldn't seem find any answers so I decided come here. Currently my settings for NVIDIA are 37% brightness 27% contrast 0.55 Gamma. I'm horrible these settings so it has been trial error until this point that I've decided ask.

1,glmk6q,ASUS,9,2020/05/18 12:20:30,Morning,Are my ASUS ROG laptop thermals normal? I bought a gaming laptop about a month ago. I've never owned a gaming PC of any kind before so I'm still being initiated all of the nuances rules of thumb mental torture involved in optimizing for gaming. The specs of my laptop are - ASUS Zephyrus G GA502 - Ryzen 7 3750h - Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q - 16GB DDR4 RAM - Windows 10 I've been playing a game that is somewhat CPU GPU intensive 60% CPU load 60% GPU have been noticing high temperatures I know shocking for a thin--light . With the 'Performance' power management mode enabled in Armoury Crate I'm getting high rock solid frame rates. However I've noticed that after a few minutes the CPU begins ramp up 90 C. While this is happening there is very little response from the fans pretty much until it hits 90 then the fans kick into overdrive. The core temp goes back down 80 or so then the fans slow down again the process repeats I have Core Temp overlaid on top of the screen so I'm watching this happen in real time . I get that ASUS wants make their laptops quiet while maximizing performance but this fan curve seems very delayed. I don't seem be experiencing any thermal throttling so presumably this kind of fan behavior is what ASUS designed for. As an experiment I tried playing the same game under the same conditions but the minimum fan speed set 50% saw much more comfortable temperatures - avg 75 C more noise but I typically wear headphones anyway . So obviously the cooling system works but ostensibly ASUS believes that as long as I'm below 90 it's all good. The fans do a decent job of keeping the CPU temp stable below 90 brief excursions above 90 are not frequent usually only occur when loading a new map etc. so I guess this is just the temperature it was designed operate at? In summary my questions are 1. Is 90C actually an acceptable temperature run for normal gaming sessions? The consensus I see repeatedly online is that it's probably fine but not really ideal. In fairness the max rated operating temp of the Ryzen 7 I'm running is 105C so I'm well below that. Also I don't seem be experiencing any performance hits at that temp. 2. Should I try setting a more aggressive fan curve bring the temps down? I'm not interested in re-applying thermal paste or undervolting so this this seems like the easiest solution me. 3. I know that running the fans more increases wear on the bearings but I'm assuming that having those croak is preferable potentially shortening the life of my CPU/GPU or other heat-sensitive components. I don't game a whole lot a few hours here there on the weekend. Is my thinking correct here? I sound pessimistic about this but in general I'm very happy this laptop. I have just been going a bit crazy over the past few weeks trying get a straight answer on why it's running hot that's actually Ok. Advice / education on this topic is greatly appreciated!

The problem has been random instability. Using bios 1405 it went from random restarts nothing in logs nothing like a BSOD refusing boot requiring shorting the CMOS boot. It would hang at the ram led. Got the point where it would run for days fine then unusable for days at a time wouldn't post would run for a few hours that kind of thing then run OK. I was ready send it back when 1407 came out. Using bios 1407 the instability seemingly stopped until this morning when it shut itself down for no reason. Now it restarted just fine today but now I'm on watch. Reading through various threads I'll log for future use the idea of disconnecting the Sata drives see it'll bring back a boot without messing the bios. I was surprised when I saw a post a similar setup having instability problems so I wanted put this out there see it is still occurring what's been going on. Because I'd like go back Asus AMD because my 8 year old PC my kid uses has uptime measured in months. So I don't think it's unreasonable instability be addressed.

2,gld72t,ASUS,8,2020/05/18 02:27:39,Night,Any thoughts on the Asus TUF A15? Hello everybody! I'm looking for an upgrade for my 4years old laptop I came across some pretty good deals on the Asus TUF A15 gaming laptop the Ryzen 7 4800H the RTX 2060. I have some question for fellows who already bought this laptop I'm looking for some constructive criticism on it as I have plenty other options for a new laptop atm. Nothing related performance because I already know this is a beast of a laptop in it's prince range! Firstly I saw some reviews that complain about the 144Hz monitor mainly complaints about the response time the facts that it feels kind of slow comparing it a 60hz bumped display instead of a smooth 144hz one. I am upgrading from a somewhat bad 60hz display I am really looking forward that 144hz smoothness feel that it provides. Is this panel good or perhaps decent or is it kind of bad doesn't provide a good 144hz experience? PS I don't really care that much about color accuracy contrast. I a good display for gaming some student work not for video or photo editing. The next question is about build quality. I know your experience as of now the plastic variant the black lid one. I am a student I travel the train quite a lot carrying a lot of baggage from my dorm my parents house once a month. I be sure that it doesn't crack it is sturdy enough not brake while carrying it. Also I would like some views on the hinge possible. Lastly I am asking about the any other complaints might have other suggestions have in your pocket as of now from owning it or maybe complaints from a friend or relative that owns it atm. Thanks for your time I'm looking forward for some replies! Have a great day!

1,glc9ca,ASUS,0,2020/05/18 00:58:40,Night,Ripple effect on the bottom sides of the lcd panel Hi everyone I recently bought an Asus Vivobook 15 yesterday I noticed that when i move the lid close it or just by gently hitting the table so that the lid wobbles very little on both the right left areas exactly where the hinges are that causes very small ripple effects like when press an lcd . I had noticed the same effect on an Acer laptop that i then sent back the store I wanted know that’s normal. The effect is really little unnoticeable I hadn’t seen it in the first place. My suggestion was that maybe the hinge keeps the lid more straight in those places so when i move the screen that’s the part where it is more rigid. Let me know what think cause it doesn’t bother me at all I just wanted know it’s harmful sorry my English is not perfect but I’m not a native speaker!

I have no computer background but do know the basics of a computer. I have recently purchased the Asus Zephyrus GA502 from Best Buy as an open-box purchase. I am constantly monitoring the laptop temperatures using HWMonitor just make sure everything is fine. On idle the cpu gpu is around 39C -45C on performance mode. Whenever I am just watching lecture videos taking notes my cpu will jump 70C - 79C. I was wondering this is normal for a laptop reach these high temps by just taking notes. My concerns I continue take notes like this will it affect the longevity of my laptop parts since its in the 70s C. Is there anything I can do help thermals? Is this normal temp range for thi AMD CHIP? I bought a cooling stand from Amazon that is coming shortly. The specs for the laptop are AMD Ryzen 7 3750h 1660ti Max-Q 512 GB SSD 120Hz 1080p screen 16 GB Ram.

So my G751 i7-4720HQ GTX970m has been getting rather hot lately CPU at 94 GPU at 88 in Dark Souls III 1080p max settings the fans ramping up quite high as well. I think a cleaning a repaste would be in order. I've got some Kryonaut which helped some of my older laptops considerably but I stumbled upon a problem when reading disassembly tutorials for my G751. I can't really tell thermal paste will be enough or I will need pads as well. The heatsink itself has different levels so it should contact the vrm's closely enough not need pads on some of the photos the stuff that was factory applied looks just like paste but on others it looks more like pads. Has anyone done this already can answer my question? And even haven't maybe just take a look at the photos tell me what think. EDIT I think I might not have been clear. I am wondering I could get away just slapping some Kryonaut on the VRM's. x200B EDIT 2 I just finished. It was just thermal paste on all components no pads needed.

I have an ASUS TUF B360 Pro Gaming Wi-Fi motherboard have two sticks of Kingston HyperX 8BGB 2666 DDR4 Whenever Ive built a PC in the past the norm is insert the RAM sticks into identical coloured slots. two grey or two black but keep the colours the same i assumed. Im not sure I have this right though need ask for peace of mind. So the two sticks are installed at the moment in A2 B2 ive enabled the XMP profile however from the manual it says that A2 A2 would be a single channel which woudl be a black a grey on the MB next each other. So without dissembling trying in real life maybe mucking something up I'd like some advice please should the RAM be installed as A2 B2 in colour identical or A1 A2 ?

1,gkwow0,ASUS,0,2020/05/17 07:41:20,Morning,0A /or CC code a possible fix I share a story of getting these qcodes especially 0A as many people may RMA their mobo when a simple solution does exist. Worse yet they may spend a lot of money on a new mobo cpu. I recently took apart my pc cleaned it upgraded the custom liquid cooling loop. I put it all back together bled the air out of the loop finally turned it on only be greater “0A” a qcode that no one seems know what it means. After hours of searching online unplugging everything except the cpu ram I had determined my mobo /or cpu were dead would need get new ones. I took the pc apart expecting get a new mobo cpu. After learning that all ASUS ROG Maximus Hero XI are sold out I decided mess around eventually I figured out the problem The CPU heatsink in this case XSPC raystorm neo was tightened too much! I was able boot no heatsink dangerous I know but I had nothing lose as I assumed it all be dead . So I put the heatsink back on then I started getting QCode “CC” instead. After loosening the heatsink it eventually booted. I stress that the heatsink screws were not cranked down when I started receiving these errors. Likely it is the fact that the heatsink uses springs so even though the screws weren’t tightened too much it was applying a lot of pressure on the CPU mobo possibly warping it having poor contact. TL DR tighten your CPU heatsink too much may get “0A” or “CC” qcode. Relevant specs i7-7700k XSPC raystorm neo metal waterblock ASUS ROG Maximus IX Hero no Wi-Fi

I am currently in the process of doing a new PC build I have ordered the Halo Lux Digital fan frames from Phantex go over my noctua fans. I have ordered 4 of the 140MM frames 3 of the 120MM frames. They will be installed in either a ASUS Helios case. The issue I am having trouble finding an answer is how effectively set up the RGB fan frames my motherboard still be able run the Neon RGB strips from Phantex. Doing RGB is still new me so forgive my ignorance however from the info I have gathered my motherboard ASUS Crosshair VIII Hero x570 has 2 5V addressable 3 pin RGB headers that are rated for 3A each. From the sources online each Halo Lux Digital fan frame 1A each. So does this mean no matter what I do I can only have 6 fan frames installed? Or is there another solution I can do? Like I mentioned earlier I would love at least get the 7 fan frames sync ASUS aura software then eventually add Neon RGB later. Hopefully someone can explain this me like im a 5 year old.

I get the point where I need create partitions select where I install it but it always gives error messages. One additional thing is when I click on the Format button it does not do anything. We tried a couple of possible solutions from clean formatting in command line but no success. I have also tried install Ubuntu but that also stops without any error just before I could select the the installation destination. It is getting quite frustrating. Does anyone else had similar problems?

I've gone as far as ordering a new bios chip since I thought it was bricked. I later realized that it wasn't bricked when I connected it an EZP2019 usb bios programmer . My bios was on version 1701 flashing that bios the programmer fixes it . I have tried the USB EZ Flashback as well as the EZ FLASH 2 method in the bios itself. After the update is complete it reboots gets stuck on 'bios is updating do not shut down...' No drives or other usb devices are connected. What am I doing wrong?

1,gkc324,ASUS,4,2020/05/16 08:14:59,Morning,Frequent laptop freezes/fluctuating FPS while gaming on ASUS TUF FX-504GD I purchased this laptop about 2 years ago I've been gaming on it since then. I undervolted the GPU soon after I got because the GTX 1050 tends get pretty hot while gaming leading some throttling.The performance was fine until now but I've started notice freezes happening in games like Doom eternal Halo 2 Anniversary.The FPS fluctuation is more noticeable in halo 2 where the FPS jumps from a solid 60 around 45ish then back up 60. I checked the GPU temperature during one of my play sessions noticed it was maxing out at 85 C. The fan is on overboost while gaming I've updated the latest version of the BIOS so I'm not sure what's leading this sudden temperature spike. Anything I'm potentially doing wrong that's leading the high temperature? Any solutions?

The aura lighting effects intermittently start flickering badly strobing really very high RPM . What's weird is that this only happens on light transitions rainbow modes changes in brightness on static it's fine. Weird thing 2 is that it's not persistent - it seems happen upon boot sometimes but then another day or after a few restarts will be absolutely fine. Weird think 3 is that normally a reboot is the only way get it stop but on one occassion updating the Armory Crate drivesoftware it was both at once restarting it did the trick. Anyone else experience like this?

I ve been using it mainly for gaming I have this feeling that this pc is way far from its peak performance measured by the numerous benchmarks i saw online . I ve tried it all updating graphic drivers windows update bios update armory crate uninstall re install ... The main game i am using solidify my point is warzone i ve seen people using the same laptop getting nearly 90 fps everything on high while i mstruggling get 40 50 60 in best cases fps on medium settings . Same goes for CS.Go i m getting 80 90 fps on high preset while benchmarks are giving double those numbers for the same cpu gpu combo. The only difference is that I m having the 8gb version single channel memory i know ryzen cpu benifits from dual channel memory performance wise but would it be the point that having 8gb of ram cuts down the performance by half ? I mean even in League of legends i m getting like 70 90 fps which is not matching the high hopes i had for my very first gaming laptop . I appreciate any help already have a nice day

2,gjnznv,ASUS,4,2020/05/15 07:01:04,Morning,ASUS Ux481 Zenbook duo non-touch main screen upgrade? Hey guys Hope y'all are well. So I recently bought the zenbook duo the non-touch enabled main screen for about 1 200 I bought it near-mint condition original packaging etc it sells for about 1 600 new where I live sales tax included. i7 256gb 16gb RAM so not the top of the specs list but all right. I like the laptop but I'm not loving that the main screen isnt touch but I thought that it was just standard so had kinda given up. Now I'm seeing that the version main screen that is touch enabled is going on sale for 1 500 excluding sales tax I'm wondering it would be worth it splash the extra 3k for the main touch screen 1tb ssd. What do guys think? I'm thinking maybe I'll sell the one I currently have because I don't see the touch version coming my region any time soon I did buy it for good value then buy the new version from the US or something like that. Do think the screen touch main screen the extra storage is worth the money? I mean 3k is like 1/4 of what I paid for this laptop so I know it isnt a lot but considering that I'll use this for at least a few years it feels like maybe it will be a worthwhile investment? Thanks y'all!
2,gjlvv6,ASUS,2,2020/05/15 05:00:45,Night,Troubleshooting Crosshair VII Hero. So my setup has been fine since i built it around 8 months ago or so. I ordered some new 200mm case fans as they needed replacing. New fans come in i power down install them. Simple stuff as ive been doing this for over 20 years now. I double check all my connections as i usually do in case something got unplugged. So i boot up the new fans bam! automatically powers down. I unplug the new fans put the original ones back in. Same issue. After hours of troubleshooting taking everything apart nothing seemed work then I realized i never tried clearing the cmos. For some reason clearing the cmos allowed it boot into windows. BUT as soon as i restart or powerdown the issue instantly comes back until i clear the cmos again. Aside from dismantling the entire rig ive also tested the PSU in another setup its fine ive also reflashed the bios the issue still exists. Pretty sure these fans i bought shorted something out on the mobo. As all the other components inside the pc work in other rigs. Anyone have any insight or something i might have missed? TLDR PC works fine installed new fans PC shuts down no q code read. Clearing cmos fixes it until i reboot or shutdown problem comes back. Thanks for reading.
1,gjpsnd,ASUS,2,2020/05/15 08:35:30,Morning,ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo UX581 i9 9980hk major CPU cooler flaw I dont know it's just an issue mine some or all of these. But after using one for 3 months i have stumbled upon an odd issue. When it was new i like benchmark my laptops see how they perform at the same time i'll check CPU temps how much they throttle. Generally use Cinebench R20 as it's a good all core load will show issues. mine scored around 3300. not bad i've seen higher scores upto 3600 around the web others similar scores mine which seemed fine me. now maybe 2-3 weeks later i noticed it was getting hotter quicker throttling more. ran cinebench R20. 2800. let it cool idle. 2850. very odd. at this point i could have sent it into asus but 6 weeks turn around time wasn't an option for me so i took it into my own hands. Decided apply new thermal paste the CPU GPU cooler. So i pulled the base off took the cooler off easy process FYI cleaned all the old paste off applied some new one. i used - cooler master gel maker great stuff. similar thermal grizzly Kryonaut. Turned it on. ran cinebench R20 3600. awesome. Undervolting decided do it. Just see what it can actually do. it's also safe so why not try. -0.120 was the sweat spot for mine. Cinebench R20 - 4020. brilliant. Fastfoward 3 weeks later ran cinebench R20... 3300. wtf? applied the undervolt. 3600. wtf? first thing i noticed was CPU Core 3 was hitting 96 deg while the rest sat around 75-85. That would cause the CPU throttle down very quickly. it wouldn't even hit the 4.2Hz all core boost. so i thought it may have been an issue my application. pulled the plate off nope looked good. cleaned it all applied some more past. same results as previous. 3 weeks later. again noticed the CPU core 3 was running 15-20 deg hotter than the rest. WTF? cinebench scores where 3200 now. i believe the issue is the Cooling block. The CPU section of the block only has 2 screws on opposite corners not allowing even pressure over the whole CPU die. Thermal expansion heat cycling over the few weeks of use must have moved the block enough lose contact on the CPU die causing thermal issues. Also the laptop chassis could have made do some more vents. or bigger. Awesome laptop well built. but flawed by the CPU/GPU cooler not having enough airflow though the vents. x200B If anyone here is reading this has the same laptop please post your thoughts on it. or run cinebenchR20 share your results. TL DR. CPU/GPU cooler is a flawed design causing thermal issues.

The thing is he got no receipt for it. The only thing that makes me trust this guy a bit more is that he got like 50 active items for sell on this site so he must have a way of getting them all cheaper maybe . So my question is...can it be a fake gpu? Cand i somehow check the authenticity of the gpu by only looking at the information on the box?

I recently purchased a used Gladius II from Amazon the USB dongle that came in the box is apparently for a ROG Fusion wireless headset not the mouse I ordered. So that's pretty weird I guess the original person who returned the mouse Amazon put the wrong dongle in the box as they look similar it got passed on me. Anyways on the point of this post I was really hoping someone could help me. I thought even though it is a longshot it is possible that someone here has a broken Gladius II mouse lying around a dongle for it collecting dust that I could buy. Either that or anyone has any information on how track down one of these I would be very grateful. I already spoke Amazon they actually eventually gave me a refund for the mouse didn't ask for it back I spoke Asus they said that they could not or would not help me. Thanks guys.

For my cooling fans I am running 3 CORSAIR HD Series 140mm for one top case fan two for my front. Then I have a 120mm for the rear fan.

7,giz1yp,ASUS,4,2020/05/14 05:29:54,Night,Did anyone manage get Asus ROG STRIX-2070S-A8G work in SLI? Is it a hidden feature? tldr solved - yes this feature is available on 2070S some benchies show its faster than 1080Ti. hope it helps make your decisions! Apparently the PCB is based of the 2080 founder's edition has this capability. I just got one it definitely has the NVLink port ready. x200B Asus box/online specs mention nothing about this but i have since researched found some sources talking about this NVIDIA carved the RTX 2070 Super out of the TU104 silicon by disabling an entire GPC worth CUDA cores leaving the chip 2 560 out of its 3 072 CUDA cores enabled besides 160 TMUs 64 ROPs 320 Tensor cores 40 RT cores. The memory subsystem is untouched. 8 GB of memory ticks at 14 Gbps sits across a 256-bit wide GDDR6 memory interface churning out 448 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The GPU clock speeds are increased too up 1770 MHz GPU Boost frequency compared 1620 MHz on the original RTX 2070. Another neat little perk of being based on the TU104 silicon is NVLink support which enables 2-way SLI. x200B Being based on the RTX 2080 the RTX 2070 Super gains a larger cooler a beefier PCB support for a feature which Nvidia has phased out of their lower-end models SLI granting the RTX 2070 multi-GPU support. This enables Nvidia users access multi-GPU RTX performance at much lower pricing than their original RTX 2080 which is great news for multi-GPU enthusiasts. x200B x200B Can some one please help me make sense of what is happening? is this a feature which we will be able unlock in the future? I understand Nvidia were looking set SLI feature premium cards only i.e. xx80s but I don't see a reason block a feature which is already in the PCB. x200B I would appreciate any feedback sorry this is not the right place - i tried do some research but wasn't able find something conclusive. x200B edit1 port s/SLI/NVLink edit2 additional source edit3 this is closed - officially supported 
1,gj9vi9,ASUS,19,2020/05/14 14:55:45,Afternoon,Does ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme Alpha have the best overclock performance among the TRX40 mobos? Hi. I have Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Xtreme mobo worry about changing mobo ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme Alpha . In 2019 December I bought TRX40 mobo Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Xtreme ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme Alpha had the best VRM among the TRX40 mobo. Both of them have 16 phases Infineon TDA21472 70A MOSFETs. As Gigabyte one has true phases VRM while ASUS one has teamed power stage design called 'dual output'? I judged Gigabyte mobo would have better overclock performance so I bought it. However ASUS Alpha now has Infineon TDA21490 90A superior both non-Alpha's Gigabyte's. But it still has teamed power stage design. x200B In this case would ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme Alpha TRX40 have a more powerful overclock performance compared Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Xtreme? Or not because of ASUS's non-true phase VRM design?

While hooked up an external display playing Burnout Paradise the laptop basically dropped frames 1 fps. Not exaggerating. Only happened once I was also downloading more steam games at the time so I wrote it off as a bug. But now... Tried again. Burnout loaded in at 5fps. Barely got the start screen. Then it locked up the point I couldn't even do anything had force restart. This isn't a high requirement game. This is old. Hell the I7-9000 should be able run this without a goddamn GPU. Half joke . Wtf is going on the laptop? It's an ASUS rog g531gt. Where do I start for troubleshooting?

2,girffz,ASUS,0,2020/05/13 19:57:15,Evening,Zephyrus G14 Refresh Rate Battery/AC SOLVED 1. Stardock Deskscapes 10 forced the platform timer resolution the highest level even though it was not being used at all causing massive battery drain. 2. The screen remained at 120Hz even on battery despite the fact that in theory it's supposed adjust automatically. SOLUTION 1 Platform Timer Found the problematic program powercfg -energy. - Uninstall Deskscapes. SOLUTION 2 Refresh Rate Installed this script followed the tutorial here In order import the task scheduler tasks need specify a user for it run under In order use the script it must be edited for 120Hz instead of 144Hz toward the bottom . You must perform the edit BEFORE signing OR enable all not just signed PowerShell scripts on your computer. ORIGINAL POST I have a new Zephyrus G14. One reason I bought it is because reviews raved up down about its battery life. My battery life is horrible think 5 hours on a full charge watching videos or surfing the web . For some inexplicable reason even when Armory Crate reports GPU is Power Saving the system is on battery both Windows Radeon settings report a 120Hz refresh rate. I can manually change this in Windows settings new Display settings - Advanced display settings - Display adapter properties for Display 1 but that seems kind of clunky. I installed Chipset Version V26.20.14001.64002. AnandTech had a similar problem though their specific issue was that the RTX2060 was waking up not the Vega GPU insisting on running at 120Hz while on battery. The machine has not been formatted it is the out-of-the-box Windows/software install.

2,gipcxl,ASUS,0,2020/05/13 17:44:00,Afternoon,Absolutely HORRIFIC RMA Experience! Looks like this is SUCH a common issue but I just gotta rant somewhere! Some months ago my PC suddenly turned off wouldn't turn back on. After much troubleshooting I came the conclusion the MB had gone bad. It was an Asus X470-F. There was no physical damage but it simply wouldn't power on. All other parts CPU Ram PSU GPU NVME etc worked in another PC. Contacted Asus. Sent it them for RMA paid my own shipping of course.. . Few weeks later they sent me a 'new' MB. I could see that it was used... way more used than mine had been... but it looked in decent enough condition. Hooked everything up then went put the NVME drive in. On taking off the M.2 heatsink first thing I noticed was the stand-off holding it up just... fell off. That seemed odd. Then I leaned in put the NVME drive in... was met this Immediately contacted Asus again. Never turned the PC on no way I was risking my parts the condition this MB was in. MB had been in its box up the moment of being built the PC has no water cooled anything it was built in a room no liquid allowed anywhere again it was never even turned on though it was connected a brand-new PSU plugged into a very good UPS only verify the status light turned on show it was getting power... then unplugged put the NVME drive in . I explained all of this them. They gave me a case number. This should have been a clue something was wrong since this probably should have been part of the same RMA. Few days later I'm asked send pictures. Which... I already had. Sent them again explained I already had explained the situation again . Said several times that this was a replacement board that Asus had sent me. And that it came me from ASUS like this. They emailed me back advising I 'send it back the place of purchase for a refund'... which again clued me in that they weren't understanding that they had sent me this board. Emailed them back once again reiterating that this was a replacement board from ASUS . Emailed me back that they were escalating the case. Received an email back today that simply said 'based on the damage shown this is not covered under our warranty. Sorry good luck!' Immediately emailed them back a... very angry email AGAIN explaining that they sent me this board it came me like this then called. Yelled a lot at the poor phone support guy I know it's not his fault he's just some dude trying read off a script he finally understood looking at the notes that everyone had been working based off the assumption that this was a new case. He then...... created a new case... said he'd be escalating it. Put me on hold a few minutes then came back said 'it looks like it was already escalated?' facepalm I explain that yes it had they'd already contacted me back saying they weren't going cover it because of the whole assumption this was a new case which was what we had been talking about this whole time . So now he's sent it back escalation I should hear from someone 'in the next 24-48 hours'... which... is what I keep getting only for the person it's escalated not understanding this was a board sent me like this from Asus . At this point it has been almost two months since I had a working PC. Asus please... I just my PC working again! This MB was absolutely amazing I just it back. I had given up on Asus more than a decade ago because the only time I've had parts die were always Asus I finally decided give y'all another chance /

1,girtiq,ASUS,0,2020/05/13 20:23:24,Evening,Zenbook Flip 14 trackpad issues Hey there I've just recieved my Zenbook Flip 14 UM462DA but for the life of me I cannot get the trackpad stop responding very weirdly. For example I move my finger in a straight line across the trackpad the cursor will move generally in the same direction but erratic movements in random directions sometimes. When the issue presents itself I can hold my finger perfectly still on the trackpad the cursor will spaz out a little. Sometimes even clicks/right clicks without me wanting it too. I've googled the best of my ability tried everything I found. The only thing that seemed have any effect was updating the laptop firmware through Windows Update missed that somehow the first time round but the issue is still present just less frequently/severely. Things I've tried Updating the BIOS the latest version Disabling any other mouse device drivers Updating/rolling back the trackpad drivers tried every single one I could find on the ASUS website as well as the Windows default ones Resetting factory settings/reinstalling Windows Updating through Windows Update like I say this had a noticeable effect Some threads I've seen say there could be a grounding issue ASUS trackpads on laptops metal cases. Given the way the issue presents itself over time it kinda seems like this could be the case the firmware update has just mitigated the issue slightly... Any things I should try before I RMA? Have 3 exams in the next 10 days so kinda fix it keep it around in the short term.

1,gir9cd,ASUS,0,2020/05/13 19:45:56,Evening,Should I buy the Zephyrus G14? So in early March I bought an HP Envy 13 13-aq0003na spent 1050 on it I needed a very light laptop a dedicated GPU was under 14 . It was my best option at the time . I originally planned buy a laptop later this year replace my crappy University-supplied Toshiba my mid-2014 MacBook Pro but had buy something early because of COVID-19. So the Zephyrus G14 will come out later this year I would like some advice as I should sell my HP Envy 13 for a Zephyrus G14 GA401H/GA401II keeping in mind that I'll be selling at a significant loss. I'm currently a final year PhD student who is getting a non-funded extension due COVID so money may be a bit of an issue. I do some 2D 3D CAD work simulations coding I sometimes game so I'm interested know guys think my HP Envy the Nvidia MX250 is enough for games or I should go for the G14 the 1650/1650Ti?

1,gippm8,ASUS,4,2020/05/13 18:05:45,Afternoon,Can't access GUI after new routemesh install I just upgraded my home system an AC3100 as a mesh router. The install was straightforward as I've come expect from ASUS. My plan was convert my current AC 1900 router AC 1750 node into nodes. I've done this type of setup before without any issues the 1900 as the router the 1750 as the node. This time it was difficult get either router set up as a node. They both repeatedly failed sync the 3100. Yes I reset each factory default updated the firmware...more than once! I was finally able get the 1900 set up as a node but as soon as everything was working as it should I lost the ability log into the 3100 GUI at all. I keep getting the following error x200B This site can’t be reached 192.168.1.1 took too long respond. Try Checking the connection Checking the proxy the firewall ERR CONNECTION TIMED OUT x200B The router node as well as the entire network function as they should. I just have no way currently manage any of it. I've tried logging in from my desktop laptop phone but always get the same result crazy definition right? . I did not set up SSH access as I have never used it a router. Other than doing a factory reset of the 3100 starting over any suggestions? I was planning on calling ASUS customer service tomorrow but figured I'd get a much quicker response here. Thanks for any help Jay

Apperently Asus need SN number for RMA the motherboard that only has it on the box but not the motherboard itself. I found 2 numbers barcodes that are not SN number on the Z170 motherboard. Backside has no number nor sticker about SN number. So I have a bricked motherboard that I cannot send for RMA because I threw away box awhile back. Is there any support I could get maybe retrieve this SN number for this motherboard? —- this is what happened—— I updated my bios since I have never done it before this motherboard. I used Bios update via Wlan connection which is from Tool section of the bios. After the update my motherboard just does not post. Specifically LED only goes for CPU RAM but never reaches VGA. Motherboard just does not post screen from igpu nor gpu. I tried one stick of Ram resitting cpu different psu cpu CMos reset none worked. I did however felt warm from all the heatsinks from motherboard gpu cpu so i know they are getting power. This was a photo when it worked before. only stickers it has d’oh! i just found hidden sn D

I believe that as it's working MacOS is recognizing the ZenScreen as an Ink Tablet as a new icon appeared in the System Settings so it receives the clicks from it it relays them whenever the mouse cursor happen be. Do know of any way I could fix this or force the clicks always happen on the second screen? If not the touchscreen would be mostly useless me because I'd need move the mouse cursor the second screen click thus defeating the whole point of it. By the way I've searched through the manual FAQs Amazon Reviews etc. without being able find any answer. Thanks in advance for any help can provide.

1,gicdun,ASUS,13,2020/05/13 06:36:26,Night,X570-P owners comment on chipset fan? Just wondering the chipset fan works as I have read that it can be noisy even at idle? I am interested in this board but I think the chipset fan can't be controlled e.g. by any software not even in the bios . I don't know it matters what hardware use. I think I read some claims that certain graphics cards might help as their fans might help the chipset fan? Supposedly Gigabyte maybe MSI have software that can control the chipset fan - e.g. fan stop? I think the X570-P is probably the best budget X570 but a noisy fan can't easily control would be a deal breaker for me. The alternative motherboards are the Asrock x570 phantom gaming 4 Msi x570 a-pro Gigabyte x570 UD. Not much competition for the X570-P but any of those offer control of the chipset fan that is crucial.

So my summer classes coming up fast cabin fever getting me I need buy a new laptop. First what is the best gaming laptop ASUS offers in your opinions? For fun let’s say no budget. Something that can run the beefiest games on the highest setting has the best specs of all of them sorry I sound like a dork I don’t know much about computers . I would really prefer get something portable hence why I’m not building a PC. Second would I be able sell my old laptop or at least the parts? I’d hate see it completely go waste. Apparently it died because of an issue the motherboard so I understand that renders it worthless. Please let me know soon! Thank so much for your help y’all.

1,gi2ea6,ASUS,2,2020/05/12 18:40:30,Afternoon,Asus ROG Strix X570-i TMPIN4 at 90C when computer asleep When I put my computer sleep whenever I turn it back on my TMPIN4 starts out at around 90C then slowly drops back a more reasonable level of 60C. Does anyone know what this temperatures sensor is associated I should be concerned about it at all? Using HWMonitor monitor it haven't had any other issues other than this. I did some research it appears that it isn't uncommon for motherboards report faulty values for some temperatures but because this slowly drops by 30C it seems like it's actually a valid temperature reading. Thanks for any help!
1,gi25ai,ASUS,3,2020/05/12 18:25:16,Afternoon,Breaking the 5 GHz barrier Excuse me I sound like an idiot I'm not super versed on the ins outs of overclocking. I have a ROG Strix Z390-E an i7-9700k. No matter what I do I can't seem exceed 4.9 GHz. At 4.9 GHz my system is rock stable I can run it for days without a crash or core dump. Bump it up 5 GHz my system core dumps like every 5 minutes. It's immediately unusable. Temps 4.9 GHz in Intel XTU are around 70 C. I've tried using AI Tweaker which normally chooses a 38% 41% overclock 5.0 5.1 GHz at a cooler score of around 160 170. Without fail this causes my system become unusable frequent core dumps. I've tried using AI Suite 3 which sometimes chooses a 4.9 GHz overclock sometimes a 5.0 GHz. If it chooses the 5.0 GHz overclock my system becomes immediately unusable. The only way I can guarantee stability is manually set my core ratio 49 for a 4.9 GHz overclock. So my questions are mainly what's going on? I thought that instability increases gradually as core ratio is increased temperature increases as voltage is increased? Right? So how come everything is perfect at 4.9 GHz 1.32V I think everything immediately falls completely apart at 5.0 GHz whatever voltage AI Tweaker / AI Suite chooses . I feel like 70 C is pretty cool for a max temp do I have some temp overhead? Again I have a very limited knowledge of this stuff sorry in advance. PC

1,ghqr99,ASUS,7,2020/05/12 08:23:41,Morning,ARGB issue PRIME x570 motherboard I just built a new PC an ASUS Prime x570 Pro motherboard. My case has ARGB fans but they don't show up in any software despite extensive troubleshooting. They are connected via the 3-pin Gen2 ARGB port at the bottom of the motherboard. I then bought a cheap generic ARGB strip kit that uses the same connector those don't even light up much less appear in software control them. I'm working this from the fan end of it too but I'm leaning toward the problem being the motherboard which works flawlessly outside of this problem given the problem the strips. I really don't RMA this thing so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
1,ghq31d,ASUS,2,2020/05/12 07:50:00,Morning,GX531GS plugged in no power indicator no power Hi all I have a GX531GS that I purchased about 1.5 years ago. The other day I left the computer unplugged powered down but when I tried plug it in the next morning use it there was no indicator light on the laptop that it was receiving power the battery was completely dead. Normally there is a battery issue I would imagine the laptop itself would still receive power. I used a multi-meter on the AC adapter it's still reading 19.8 V so the AC adapter should still be fine. The only thing I'm thinking is that somehow the contact connector between the AC adapter the power receptable on the laptop somehow isn't good thus it isn't transferring power. Didn't drop it at all or anything so there's no reason why it would stop working suddenly that I can think of. Anyone have any suggestions? I'm out of warranty I have no feel for how good Asus repair services are or how costly
1,ghpqzh,ASUS,2,2020/05/12 07:32:10,Morning,Asus FX553VD keyboard malfunctioning Edit Model is FX503V. Hello there Today I realized some keys on my laptop weren't working well. It all started the letter B N. I realized that I hold those letters for a couple of seconds they worked. So I reset the laptop. Once in the system again I realize that some other letters aren't working too. Z X are the ones. To be short what seemed be the problem of only two letters is now the problem of more B N Z X – SPACE ENTER F8 0 this last one from the number pad I uninstalled the keyboard driver reinstalled again nothing Ran W10 in safe mode nothing Took out the keys from the keyboard cleaned nothing Everything seems work fine but I can't find what was the problem why it expanded other letters. Any ideas?

2,ghk4nr,ASUS,4,2020/05/12 01:06:23,Night,How often should replace thermal paste on a gaming laptop? I have mine for a year now during that time it was sent for repair because of a mobo defect. Now everything is fixed however i am very much concerned about my temps. I am nowhere near the temps shown on the tech reviews on my laptop in youtube. I even tried playing in an airconditioned room cooler stands all. On idle it runs about 50-60 on both cpu gpu. On gaming gpu tops at 86 while cpu goes 90 even on games that are not that heavy. I have already tried undervolting the gpu which worked out fine but my cpu temps are still going 90 plus. I was thinking they did poorly on the maintenance. So is it okay i change the thermal paste?

Bought this mobo in January. If I download the driver package from the Asus website there are a bunch of install files - i always click asussetup by default after extracting run as administrator. I get a small white installing box a prompt pops up saying I need restart pc which I do. It seems have installed the drivers sonic studio/radar. The drivers do seem work - but there is slight crackling in some games when using dolby. digital output Siberia 840 headset - firmware is up date Furthermore I have no audio manager aside from the windows 10 sound control panel. Sonic studio crashes upon opening as well. So i cannot use case audio jacks or control audio in any way? thinking realtek HD manager or supremefx which i had my strix x99 mobo - no issue ever. If I uninstall the audio drivers revert windows standard - no crackling BUT i still have no audio managecontrol. So my question Can i just download the standard realtek drivers from their site use as normal get full use of mobo features some sort of audio manager or do I NEED utilise the mobo specific drivers sonic studio. If i do how do i get it work as intended? x200B I'm pretty good this sort of thing but audio drivers look like a real deep dive!! Thanks in advance.

1,ghdyll,ASUS,13,2020/05/11 17:20:32,Afternoon,FX 505 Fan Rattling Hello I just got this laptop about 4 - 5 months ago the CPU fan started rattling recently about a couple minutes after it starts up. It usually disappears which is when the fan is running at about 5000 RPM but comes back whenever the fan is only around 2500 RPM. Sometimes this also prevents the fan from going 5000 gets stuck around 3500 . Is this simply a problem dust accumulating since it took a while before it started happening simply requires cleaning or do I need replace the fan? x200B EDIT Just additional stuff sometimes when it does get 5000 I go back Silent Mode the GPU Fan goes back down immediately but the CPU Fan seems be stuck on 5k until about a minute later.

1,gh7ktd,ASUS,1,2020/05/11 11:17:32,Morning,Deciding on the A15 I have been wondering how the asus community has felt about the A15 or A17 i have decided on that laptop because i an a student i wanted something that was tough had a decent battery was well rounded for school games basically anything i did on it. My worry is that ive noticed people having a bit more trouble drivers noise thermals tho ive seem the thermals on the A15 are acceptable that come along asus computers. Can anyone tell me about their experience the computer or other asus producs are these people issues the minority?
1,gh5yom,ASUS,2,2020/05/11 09:49:33,Morning,Asus TUF A15 fan control doesn't seem ideal Hi I got a new Asus TUF A15 a couple days ago overall very happy it. The fan speed logic seems like it could be better though 1 -- The minimum fan speed seems be 2200 RPM when it's not stopped. This seems unnecessarily fast for a minimum it produces a pretty noticeable amount of noise. Also when the fan starts spinning from a stop it blasts up 3000 RPM before it quiets down 2200 RPM. When I'm using the laptop in silent mode it will cycle between being completely silent fan stopped then occasionally loud when the fan starts then quieter for a while 2200 RPM then silent again. Surely it would be better overall then fan just ran slower all the time like 1000 RPM or so? 2 -- When in silent mode the fan will often start spinning when the temperatures are only in the mid-40s start spinning faster when the temperatures are around 50. How does this make sense? The laptop is designed for gaming temperatures in the 80s sometimes 90s. So why is silent mode trying keep the temperatures below 50? Surely it could let them get up at least like 60 before spinning up the fans?

My computer worked fine until one day suddenly it said ”no boot drive” detected on start.

Plugged it in the computer still didnt detect any drives in bios. Figured it might have been the sata cable so bought 2 new sata cables none of them worked either the sata power cables from the power supply are working because i plugged in 3rgb fans into them test the power the fans lit up. The drive is not detected in bios or windows installation program here are some picturesin bios all ports are enabled everything. Id also like add this is an brand new build everything was new Chassis Cpu Gpu Psu motherboard except the 5 year old ssd which i kept from my previous pc as i said i ran that drive for about 1 month it worked fine until i got this problem.
6,ggxiv9,ASUS,2,2020/05/11 00:10:37,Night,Asus Tuf VG32VQ review Hey all I wanted do a review of the VGVQ because I have not seen much posted about it the only reviews I can find are sponsored sites or dedicated hardware review sites. TLDR for the current price of 450 shipped I could not recommend this monitor enough. For a 1440p gaming experience this thing delivers. x200B Lets start off the good The panel ships both HDMI Displayport cables in the box this is a move I found particularly wise because at this price point many people may be upgrading from an HDMI only display might not even have a displayport cable lying around. VESA standard support supports both 75x75 100x100. 144hz Freesync G-sync compatibility. Also supports Asus' elmb which some find be nauseating but I don't personally have any issue. Asus advertises 1ms response time real world this feels more like 3-5ms but at true QHD this is expected. Shockingly thin bezels. Good screen curvature. Price performance is the best I have seen in this level of monitor speaking only the brand new market . HDR while not great ability allows play HDR games content. x200B The Bad Out of the box color brightness was atrocious. To properly calibrate this display get a brightness that could be seen without damaging my retinas I had spend around 40 minutes tinkering around windows settings monitor settings. HDR is more of a gimmick on this monitor it allows windows play HDR content but 400 ish nits of brightness is nowhere near a good HDR viewing experience. This is more of a personal gripe than anything but the lack of USB ports on this monitor is probably one of the things that cause this monitor be ignored by most consumers reviewers. x200B Closing thoughts I have been using this monitor for about a week for productivity gaming media consumption. I am genuinely impressed this monitor it competes directly its higher priced Asus ROG 32 cousin. your budget is around 500 for a monitor this one will not disappoint.

1,ggy2o5,ASUS,2,2020/05/11 00:59:33,Night,Did I kill my Vivobook? Desperate college student in need of help. Hey everyone. I have a 14 ASUS Vivobook Flip 2-in-one tablet/laptop that's giving me issues. It runs Windows 10 on 64 bit Intel Core i5. It's about two years old at this point. A few hours ago it was working just fine. Then something under the right hand panel just under my keyboard started making a weird gurgling or churning sound. Didn't pay much attention it because everything was fine for the next few minutes. I was working on a scholarship application listening some music on Google Chrome but when I tried open a new tab in the window I was working from I got stuck on Waiting for cache... for a really long while. I decided restart my computer since it seemed like I was disconnected from our WiFi network. Restarted it just fine programs like Chrome Discord Slack Microsoft Teams took a bit longer boot up but it was whatever. Managed reconnect our network by moving my laptop closer our router. Finished the scholarship application in around 20 minutes. Then did a speed test on Xfinity's website speedtest.net. Results were typical. Moved back the living room where I was working before. Tried do the speed tests again no luck. Tried restart my computer again. Programs took even longer boot up. Fuck it decided do a system restore 5 days ago see that helps. Tried doing so 3 times at 2 different checkpoints besides the one my laptop automatically created on May 4. This all happened around 9 30 P.M. I've been continuously running system restores restarting my laptop for nearly 6 hours now no progress made. Now only my cursor works. Everything beyond my login screen is basically unresponsive. Every time I try run a system restore I get a message saying it failed extract a file associated Norton Antivirus. I Googled it saw that turning off or disabling your antivirus might help but I can't even access my control panel at this point because of how slow everything is. Did I fuck up my hard drive crack it shift it out of place etc. ? I've done a lot of traveling this laptop it's never given me issues quite like this. Did I somehow damage whatever is under the right side of the keyboard? Should I seek a professional's help? I have quite a few final projects due for school in the coming days I would really appreciate getting some help so I don't have use my dad's laptop. I'm sorry parts of this post are incoherent it's now 4 A.M. I'm tired pissed. I can supply some photos videos needed in the comments. Thanks in advance.
6,ggp35l,ASUS,2,2020/05/10 14:23:06,Afternoon,One of my RAM sticks doesn't light up. I just built my new PC yesterday I noticed that one of my RAM sticks doesn't light up. I use the Asus B450-f Gaming Motherboard in the manual it says the primary DIMM slots are A2 B2 but whenever I insert them into the slots I noticed that only my A2 RAM stick lights up. I'm using the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro sticks at 3200mhz it's not like my motherboard doesn't recognize that there's two RAM sticks in there because it works I have my full 16GB but I've tested this out the only time my RAM sticks light up is when they're both in A1 A2 both B1 B2 don't allow my RAM light up for some reason. If anyone can help me I'd really appreciate it because it'd suck I get more RAM only half of it lights up not mention I don't sacrifice performance just so my computer looks pretty. EDIT Omg so I just now realized that my motherboard actually doesn't recognize my second RAM stick in the B2 slot but that's one of the primary DIMM slots I have dual channel available so can anyone help me?

I got this machine in mid-March from Best Buy have barely been able use it because of these issues. The first thing I noticed is insane high pitched coil whine. A quick Google search informed me it goes away I use the LED backlight on the keyboard... Okay that's weird but okay I guess. The big issue is after about three minutes in any game the computer starts throttle very harshly down live five frames per second in most instances this throttle repeats itself every fifteen seconds or so even on the lowest possible graphics resolution settings. What is going on here? And does anybody know how fix it? I've been scouring tech support forums Reddit threads looking for solutions reasoning I've tried them all. I've updated the BIOS first 208 back when I got it now 302 since it released hoping for a better result. I haven't removed the black film on the heat pipes or fan covers because I don't void my warranty. I'm using all the ASUS drivers from their site I have the 'Armoury Crate' software installed along 'ASUS Live Service' all the other stuff that it seems is essential even get the laptop run using its GPU I've tried every setting in Armoury Crate... Et cetera. Does anybody else have this machine? Have had these issues or been able fix them? How? Thanks for reading I'm hoping somebody can help.

1,ggo7os,ASUS,0,2020/05/10 13:34:32,Afternoon,Can’t figure this out please help! First off thank anyone who can contribute in any way this this has been baffling me like crazy... Ok so I built a ROG Strix 570-e system a 3900x a 2080 ti when I first went boot it I noticed it wouldn’t start. All I got were two flashing red lights on the GPU. I couldn’t find a fix for this so I decided just try check the connections what not. Well that’s what I did... then magically everything just turned on the second time I tried boot it. Ok so at this point I thought maybe there was a loose connection or something. This was 3 days ago. Today I finish my cable management the computer boots up as normal no issues or anything like that. However I decide test out the USB Type C connection in the front since that’s the only thing I hadn’t tested it caused a USB power surge or something. At this point I’m freaking out thinking what the heck something is wrong the mobo. So I shut down the computer boom here comes those flashing red lights on the GPU again. The computer won’t turn on so I decided unplug the USB type C connector from mobo try that. BOOM that made the computer boot. At this point ’re probably thinking like I am that it’s the USB port or something right? Well I shut down the computer plugged in the USB Type C cable into the motherboard I get those flashing red lights on the GPU again. Again the computer won’t boot. So I decided let me unplug replug the GPU power cables check that. To my surprise the computer booted up the USB type C port now seems work perfectly fine when I plug in my iPhone. What in the world is going on? Should I be worried? Has anyone ever had this type of issue? I don’t think that I move my PC this will start happening again or something. Super confused would really appreciate any advice on the matter. I contacted ASUS support but they said they couldn’t help me over the phone because of Clovid-19 there’s not enough reps. So I went the chat after 3 hours of waiting I gave up. This is my first experience ASUS support so far I’m hating everything about it.

3,ggdrme,ASUS,4,2020/05/10 03:19:39,Night,Irks Armoury Crate/Armoury II ROG peripherals This is more of a vent than an actual ask for help but any advice would be welcome appreciated I'll have built my rig a year ago in September as a uni student limited funds I've built it up steadily when I've had the spare cash. So far I'm running the Maximus Hero XI Black Ops 4 edition mobo Ryujin 240mm AIO Strix RTX 2070 Gaming OC graphics card all from Asus. The case is NZXT's H500i memory is Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 3200MHz Also running an i5 9600k CPU but that's being swapped for an i9 9900k at some point in the near future . For peripherals I'm using the ROG Spatha Strix Scope RGB also from Asus. Don't get me wrong when the lighting works for my setup it looks beautiful I'll try include some pics of my rainbow unicorn barf below but throughout this build I've had several persistent issues either component design or software that have made using my lighting effectively a bit of a chore 1 Parts don't light up properly on startup at all sometimes. When I boot up my PC it sometimes takes a few seconds for the lighting come on sync up everything else it's be expected as that's just a given when a system starts up. But more often than not at this point either peripherals stay unlit or my RAM doesn't sync up the rest of my lighting meaning I then have go into armoury crate either set the lighting scheme or manually re-sync components that don't do it for themselves which feels unnecessary for a system that should work as intended. 2 Parts don't light up properly on shutdown/sleep. I love that I can have a little hint of lighting coming from my computer even when I'm not using it as it gives my room a little more character too thank's Corsair's iCue platform my RAM can have lighting effects running specifically for when the computer's on standby. However since the only Asus part of my build that lights up on standby/shutdown is my mobo the lighting effects don't sync up in these states I tend keep it on a static red scheme goes the red in my case too . Lately though my mobo has taken staying on rainbow mode even though it's set the static setting in armoury crate which can be very distracting when trying watch TV or sleep. 3 Parts have obscenely bright LEDs that I don't or can't turn off. This applies in majority the Strix RTX graphics card which has a pair of LED indicator lights on the 8 pin connector ports show they're in use. The graphics card has a physical LED on/off switch on it but it doesn't affect these tiny pinpricks which for some reason have enough power light up the entire inside of my case on their own steam just the aurasync LEDs that I running when the PC's running. Would it really have cost so much make these LEDs work the POST only setting in BIOS give the option disable them when the PC's off for the same reason of just how damn distracting they are when trying sleep? And why so fricking bright?! I could light the bottom of the Marianas trench how bright these 2 little suckers are!! 4 Ryujin's OLED screen doesn't show what ask it . Having a mini OLED screen in your PC that can show animated ROG symbols System info such as fan speed CPU temps etc. My personal favourite is a stroke of brilliance that really adds the functionality eye-catching factor of one of these builds. I love being able glance at my tower when playing a game just make sure I'm not melting my CPU. But I hate that half of the times I turn my PC on I have go into armoury crate manually reset this feature given it has reload when I do this I can only assume it's some sort of firmware crash that causes this . It's a pain for the same reason as point number 1. I know Armoury Crate is a beta app but the fact can't use the screen without it as far as I'm aware means that this part should at least be functionally polished before they rolled the product out onto shelves. 5 Lighting profiles/layouts don't always load on app loading. Another damn good idea imo being able set lighting keyboard profiles trigger when starting a set /series of app s is awesome... When it works as intended. You're going on Spotify? We gotcha your lights are set music mode . Playing LoL are we? There's your key settings sorted ... Except when it has a brain-fart have try get into Armoury crate from a full screen game change profiles since setting it function on app loading seems override the ability bind it a hotkey one of the reasons I bought the Scope in the first place . Also why did they remove the Smart lighting setting The one that used Red/Yellow/Green lighting indicate CPU/GPU temps/usage from profiles? That was a handy feature for early access games like Satisfactory indicate just how heavy the game was running on your rig. 6 ROG Spatha doesn't work Armoury Crate yet . This will probably get fixed/added later on in Armoury Crate's beta roadmap. But AC is supposed be the 'one app for all your ROG needs' solution having loads of lighting on your rig isn't it? Because it only works Armoury II at the moment this means that the Spatha can't take part in the flashy lighting sequences my other components got going on leading it stick out like the awkward kid at the school dance Totally not speaking from experience there . This also raises another issue that will be addressed in the final point of this rant 7 Armoury II Armoury Crate DO NOT play well each other... AT ALL. Since my Scope can share its lighting sync the rest of my build naturally I have it set in sync the rest of my rig except the aforementioned Spatha poor thing . However this also means that while the Scope's synced the rest of my rig in Armoury Crate the bouncer won't let me into Armoury II adjust the Spatha's settings such as thumb button settings etc. . This is infuriating as it means I first have go AC unsync my keyboard so I can then go into AII adjust my button bindings still winds me up that they didn't add individual entries for the thumb buttons act as individual intended thumb buttons instead requiring either a keyboard or function binding which can make it difficult set up for some games looking at Satisfactory other functions. Now I can hear the comments of just use Aura Sync AII instead of AC it'll make your life a load easier rushing in but the engineer in me wants see AC really function as intended because it DOES have the potential be a powerful tool for enthusiasts as well as act as a great platform for future innovative leaps that Asus could make in the future. However it also begs the question of it works AS why doesn't AII work or even be allowed work as it gets disabled AC?! Allowing it function in conjunction AC would surely be more streamlined than forcing unsync from one gain access the other. If it's an issue the settings of one app interfering the other simply disable access the peripherals using the other app control the settings continue supporting the ones that aren't rather than disabling a whole app. I am not a Software engineer Mechatronics Robotics are my forte so I can't begin grasp at the technical aspects growing pains creating supporting this sort of program is probably challenged by. However prior experience has taught me that writing programs can be a major headache when have isolate fix/remove bugs that can break the intended function of that code so most of these gripes will probably be ironed out as AC leaves beta. Certain design choices by the engineers at Asus however do beg the question of how rushed their production cycles must be meet market deadlines they are missing logical leaps that would make user experience far more enjoyable. Their products are high quality some innovative twists the design but I wish those innovations wouldn't come at cost the quality of the ecosystem running the show. I'm sure garnering a good reputation for reliability the user base is more profitable than pumping out new designs every quarter but they still have a decent way go before they get my full 5 stars. x200B TLDR I decided gripe about my main windups the Asus products I'm using in hopes that someone will learn from my mistakes. P.S If managed read all the way through this post I hope enjoyed it had a laugh. I'm still working on my build get it ROG perfection but for now here's a few pics of my setup as it currently is. Please also feel free suggest any build tips or correct my spelling

New reddit Last year my laptop got stolen now Its gotten the point where I really need save up get a new one for life work. I've been trying do a lot of research into what laptop I get so I can pick one know what save up for but I have a learning disability that makes me unable comprehend numbers which makes looking at lab top specs really really overwhelming Im also just not the most tech savy on top of that my previous laptop was a macbook that gives any implication on what I know about laptops . I started looking at gaming laptops first Im not an intense gamer I play ps4 nintendo regularly but casually start getting into some PC games eventually twitch stream for fun as well so I figured since I have save up anyway I could get a gaming laptop kill two birds one stone. I travel a lot for work so Id need something not extremely bulky I have run programs like photoshop video editors. I deduced that ASUS seems the best way go originally I found the ASUS ROG Zepheryus g14 its got amazing reviews seems be really well rounded for my needs of travelling/photoshop/games/ etc but it hasnt been announced when it will released in Canada Im worried it will be a long time because of Covid when I can't wait too terribly long since work never stops so I thought I would ask what people thought on some other ASUS gaming laptops I was looking at such as the following x200B -Asus Rog Strix -Asus Rog Strix 3 -Asus ROG -Asus ROG Zepheryus thin x200B Does anyone know when the g14 might come Canada? If were me couldnt get the G14 which other laptop would get why? Any input is appreciated! Ive tried sort through lots of threads about each laptop but am still struggle figure out things......

1,gg7c8r,ASUS,1,2020/05/09 18:48:54,Afternoon,AiMesh not working consistently for all devices I set up an AiMesh network in my house using a RT-AX88U router connected the CAT-5 ethernet plug two RT-AC68Us as AiMesh nodes. The setup is have my AiMesh router upstairs where the CAT-5 plug is have one node directly downstairs Living Room one node further away downstairs Bedroom . When I first set the whole thing it everything worked great. But after a day I noticed that devices connected the furthest way Bedroom node was not getting any internet connection. It only happens certain devices on that node. For example yesterday it was my Samsung TV which WiFi receiver is working fine as I connected it my mobile hotspot it worked while my iPhone works then stops. To fix that I switched the RT-AC68Us then both my Samsung TV iPhone worked - not really sure why that fixed it but it was late so I accepted it went bed. Today I checked my Amazon Echo Show which is closest the Bedroom node it appears have the same problem as my TV yesterday - it connects WiFi shows strong signal but no internet connection. I have not turned on any filtering or blocking. I like not having switch different WiFi networks so I didn't just use the RT-AC68Us in repeater mode but the unreliable internet connection is driving me nuts. Here is a quick shot of what my setup is like Here is the Bedroom node 3 devices connected Would like help on where start troubleshooting this... interestingly enough the closer Living Room node doesn't appear have much issues. EDIT I also have Adaptive QoS enabled for adaptive QoS Automatic Setting prioritizing Games .

1,gg3rb8,ASUS,1,2020/05/09 15:02:11,Afternoon,All ASUS build Hey guys. I am moving toward an all new build all ROG/Strix components. I got my Gladius 2 mouse a couple days ago the Strix MX Cherry keyboard Balteus Qi should arrive this weekend. Recently I plugged in my Gladius installed Aura Sync on my fully up--date Windows laptop. It’s been buggy at best. It randomly stops lighting effects seems have a mind of its own. I read that I should try Armory Crate as that is essentially the ASUS hub for all devices moving forward. So I uninstalled Aura Sync tried Armory Crate. It detected updated my mouse drivers then the mouse disappeared from AC. After several complete uninstalls that included wiping out all installation/program files leftover several reinstalls from both the ASUS download site the MS Store it still fails detect the mouse. This concerns me enormously. I have a ton more ASUS components on the way which will have run through Armory Crate for fine tuning lighting effects. Should I abort this build send this stuff back? Maybe Gigabyte Corsair would be better?

I bought an Asus Pro WS X570-ACE today but the memory QVL is kinda sparse its listings of approved ram kits. QVL here So the kit HX432C16PB3AK2/16 is listed under the 3200mhz section as well as the kit HX432C16PB3AK4/64 but this kit HX432C16PB3A/16 is listed nowhere on the QVL even though it looks exactly the same as the other two kits follows the same serial no. naming convention. Do think the HX432C16PB3A/16 1 x 16GB kit will run at the advertised 3200mhz even though it's not on the QVL?

There were relatively a lot of posts about ASUS MB's doing LED firmware upgrade for 40 minutes at every single boot. Others a q-code reader have concluded that it must be a hardware problem there were people who fixed this solely by taking their PC apart assembling it again. I try out taking it apart but I'm waiting currently at the updating screen. If it really doesn't update the LED firmware then can I shut it down without making things worse? It's been doing that for at least a week every day when I turn it on I start get very annoyed...

1,gg0qd5,ASUS,3,2020/05/09 12:16:46,Morning,Asus Q551LN Screen Backlight Problems Hopefully somebody familiar my laptop model can offer a bit of advice x200B I've had an issue the display on my Asus Q551LN laptop. A few years back part of the bezel that covers one of the hinges bent a bit the laptop hinge would scrape pop against the bent bezel every time I opened closed the laptop. A friend of mine coincidentally also had a Q551LN that she was scrapping for parts because it wasn't working I should clarify it had nothing do the display so I swapped out the bezel-screen assembly from hers because the bezel was in a much better condition. While swapping out the bezel-screen assembly I failed disconnect the battery before plugging in the video cable from the new screen into the motherboard. Upon powering up the laptop the screen backlight would not illuminate the screen. Holding a flashlight the screen would show the screen image very faintly. I read online that can be a result of either a blown backlight potentially caused by failure disconnect the battery before swapping screens or a bad inverter board. Not wanting spend the money on a new screen test it I shelved the laptop for a couple years. x200B Fast forward the present. I recently ordered a new screen just the screen not the bezel from eBay swapped the old screen out the new one. This time I made sure disconnect the battery before performing the swap. After I plugged everything back in I discovered I had the same issue as before where images of the desktop cursor can be faintly seen while shining a flashlight on the screen. x200B Doing some searching online I read that inverter board are only used for LCD screens because LED screens don't consume enough power require an inverter. Looking at the specs for the screen I ordered on eBay it seems the screen for the Q551L is indeed an LED in fact the Q551LN may not have an inverter board at all. Since I know it's not the screen or the video cable what else could be causing this issue? I don't have any multimeters or tech tools narrow it down individual components on the motherboard but I was hoping somebody could point me in the right direction so I can do more research on it. x200B Thanks for your time.

1,gg0f2e,ASUS,0,2020/05/09 12:00:31,Morning,Testing inner workings of Aura Hi there Armoury Crate worked for the last few weeks but today it broke I'm messing it for hours. Well I uninstalled it tried install Aura it worked. I was amazed opened it but the motherboard the ram are still missing. My understanding of the app is that the software checks for all aura capable components writes it the LastProfile.xml file. My really stupid idea is that maybe it is possible initialize components by manually adding the parts. But for this I need the parts from another profile. In my case I am missing the parts for my b450-i motherboard XG258q the Gskill trident Z memory. Thanks in advantage

I have only 2 mainstream options of memory pair my 3700X ASUS X570 GAMING PRO both on the gray market imported without taxes Ballistix Elite DDR4-3600 UDIMM C16 16GB 2x8GB sticks - BLE8G4D36BEEAK - around 155 dollars free shipping . G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4-3600MHz C18 16GB 2x8GB sticks - F4-3600C18D-16GTZN - around 170 dollars free shipping . i was about pick the C16 version for 20 dollars less but the exchange rate rose dramatically after some stupid shit our president did on the past days they all sold out. I understand the differences between C16 C18 I really don't mind a RGB-less stick but i don't know which chip brand is better MICRON 1st or SK HYNIX 2nd how it would impact my gaming daily tasks. also I have an official store selling the HyperX Predator RGB DDR4- 3200MHz C16 16GB 2x8GB sticks - HX432C16PB3AK2/16 for around 150 dollars . this particular model is NOT SUPPORTED on que QVL but it's RGB-less counterpart is. do think it would work? so it all comes down 3 questions 1. which model should i pick why? 2. how much would the C18 impact on my daily performance? 3. would the hyperX be a good deal even 3200MHz C16? would it work on my ASUS mobo? thank all in advance.

Essentially I use it my non-touchscreen Win10 laptop as a secondary screen for markups basic diagrams note taking etc. Essentially turn it into a large Surface Pro albeit tethered my laptop . I'm not an artist so I don't need lots of pressure sensitivity etc. but I would still need a stylus be more than 1 of those rubber-end sticks.

I have the g.skill trident z rgb RAM remembered I had trouble getting them work when I first built the PC but I knew that using Aura Sync I was able control them. Upon trying boot up Aura Sync I got the error Aura Service is currently unavailable . Since then I have tried everything I could think of. Numerous Reddit threads youtube videos where every solution does nothing fix this issue. I've tried a fresh download downloading an earlier version unblocking the file before extracting it rebooting my PC unplugging it reinstalling the RAM using Task Manager try manually start the service but absolutely nothing changes the outcome. At one point I even gave up on Aura sync tried use the g.skill software but that does nothing change the RAM. As of now I have no clue what do the only progress I've made was somehow freezing the default rainbow effect where my RAM is stuck on half green half yellow upon rebooting the PC once. Any help is extremely appreciated. x200B TL DR Keep getting the Aura service is currently unavailable have tried everything I could think of fix it.

1,gfotdm,ASUS,2,2020/05/08 23:52:19,Evening,What is happening when my GPU fan is spinning fast loud before my PC screen comes on? ASUS Prime X470-pro Is this the forum get help from Asus on motherboards? I have a R5 3600 cpu 16gb 3200 ballistix LT sport a Strix GTX960 in my ASUS Prime X470-pro the newest BIOS. If I load optimised default settings in the BIOS it will set the ran run a 2400 the GPU fan will spin fast loud for around 8 seconds before the screen comes on the PC boots up. The GPU didn't do this on my old Asus P6T motherboard. So what's happening? Is this when memory training is happening? If I activate DOCP in the BIOS the RAM runs at 3200 Post/boot is the same most times but sometimes it gets stuck at the loud GPU fan stage never boots until I press the reset button several times or hold the power button until it turns off then turn it on again it might do the 8 seconds loud part then boot. I've been experimenting the Ryzen DRAM calculator 3200 safe settings all entered in the BIOS sometimes the PC will boot very fast the GPU fan only spinning for a instant before turning off the screen coming on. Which is a tantalising glimpse of how good it can be but I turn it off switch off at the wall the next boot will have the loud GPU period of slow POST.

1,gfjkom,ASUS,0,2020/05/08 17:18:32,Afternoon,What Are My RepaiReplacement Options For A Laptop Without A Screen Asus N550JX ? Pictures x200B The laptop's screen housing are completely removed from the laptop so it only has the keyboard. It is just the keyboard touchpad the screen completely missing. The hookups/wires for the original screen are still there. Works fine when plugged into an external monitor. Here are the options I was looking at 1 Cost 80- 200 Buying the parts repairing myself. This one stumps me because it is a touchscreen laptop. I have never repaired one of those only smartphone screens. Going here gives me the option for LCD Screen Touch Digitizer. If someone has a definitive answer for this one then I would have no problem putting all the pieces together. So far the only thing I know definitely is that I will need the LCD back covehinges combo the LCD screen 1920x1080p glossy/matte options . But I don't know the touchscreen digitizer is required. 2 Cost 40 Portable monitors. This is actually not a bad idea never heard of them until now. It's an intriguing enough option that I would consider selling off my main computer 2600k running an egpu setup the Asus N550JX. Then when I needed work from the living-room just bring the portable monitor along. It's ghetto looking but it would work . Picked up a USB powered one from AOC for cheap it works perfectly. If it came down it could a 3D print housing be made permanently attach it the laptop? The only con about this is I am still not 100% sure how this would work. Does the portable monitor need the main screen be attached? Are there touchscreen options available do they work? Is a portable monitor a quality downgrade from the original monitor? And finally the expense of an egpu that can handle an FE Vega seems unlikely at under 200 so am I missing something there? 3. Cost 49.99 Are there wireless displays that I can use? This would actually be the most convenient but the last I even heard of this type of setup was Intel wireless display. I think that's dead. This is a bad idea for multiple reasons after looking at the current technology screenbeam . And now that I have the portable monitor it really seems pointless. If I am wrong please correct me. 4. Cost Arm a leg Just send it a local repair shop. Wouldn't mind I know a few mom pop stores that could use some business right now. Did this wow would not recommend. Even the most basic of questions was answered 'Bring it in we don't know until we run a PAID diagnostic'. It was like talking a Skyrim NPC that only had 3 lines. Extras In the event that I go option 2 is there a 3d printing place I can contact make a clip on cover for the exposed part for where the monitor used be? That way it looks like a smart keyboard rather than a broken laptop no screen. What would be the cost what information would they need complete the project? Thanks.

The reason I found why Aura Sync was not running is because of Valorant. If play Valorant also need install their anti-cheat software Riot Vanguard. Riot Vanguard will block certain files upon starting up your pc. It is dumb annoying but I believe Riot is trying limit how many files it will block. That file that was blocked might have been something that Aura Sync requires. I personally don't play Valorant because I was never really interested in FPS games so I simply uninstalled Riot Vanguard it Aura Sync worked fine afterwards. TL DR If have something like Vanguard something that will block certain files from loading uninstall it from your system Aura Sync should work properly afterwards.

2,gf3mnm,ASUS,2,2020/05/08 01:51:07,Night,ASUS Laptop CRITICAL PROCESS DIED can't boot up in Safe Mode can't access desktop. Help!! A few weeks ago I had an unfortunate spill on my laptop. However after drying it out over night it's mostly been fine - it just seemed that the battery was shot as I could no longer unplug my laptop but the computer itself worked just as it usually did. Whenever I had move the laptop from room room I'd put it in Sleep mode unplug move rooms plug it in again press a key wake it up. This worked fine though sometimes I pressed a key by accident while moving the laptop it would attempt wake up then shut off since it wasn't getting any juice from the shot battery. Yesterday I was noticing that the battery light on the side of the laptop had started flashing no clue why. And then when I'd put the laptop sleep as soon as I unplugged it from the power source it would attempt wake up then shut off . This was annoying having endure the long boot up process every time I changed rooms but it was manageable. Also the battery icon on my laptop now had an 'X' over it hovering over it would tell me it was 255% charged . I tried fiddling around Battery drivers reinstalling or enabling/disabling them but this didn't change anything. Then one of the times I was moving the laptop it was taking abnormally long boot up stuck on the ASUS screen then eventually started performing a Startup Repair... This completed then I was able log-in like normal. Then it did that again the next time I booted it up but failed now I'm getting a blue screen CRITICAL PROCESS DIED no way access my desktop through safe mode or otherwise unable do a system restore I've tried three times all of them have failed I'm at a loss. Any help at all would be appreciated. It's an ASUS X556U running Windows 10. I have access the troubleshoot menu which allows me get into command prompt but there's an error every time I try safe mode. Thank in advance.

I have nothing downloaded on it except for Bitdefender your basics like Firefox Microsoft programs. My laptop has never been dropped no one uses it but myself. x200B I have noticed over the course of the last 2 - 3 weeks my laptop - Has a small group of black pixels at the top left of my screen that lag. I'll open a program they'll remain black for a half a minute before changing whatever colouimage should be there like a thumbnail picture . - My browser has been freezing becoming unresponsive despite only having 2 - 5 tabs open? Ie. 5 tabs of Reddit lol - My laptop seems have moments where after it turns on it cannot find any WiFi connection despite me having two different internet providers set up. - It blue screened a couple of times saying that there was an an error it needed restart. Stop code WHEA UNCONTROLLABLE ERROR. x200B I always update my system make sure that my drivers are up date. I recently used Geek Squad support who said that he found a couple of updates that needed be done ? that everything should work fine now - obviously it is not. Does anyone have any idea as what may be causing these issues? Is the pixel situation something that they're able repair? x200B Thank for your time I appreciate it.

A couple weeks ago my VG278Q went all white i opened a case asus. pretty straight forward stuff they created an RMA case for me shipped them the monitor. they are now claiming that there is a scratch on the screen they are refusing repair the unit.

It also doesn't seem matter them that i have been a long time customer of theirs have spend thousands thousands of dollars on asus product as a consumer a small business consultant. So I'm pretty disappointed say the least. i feel betrayed. now i have go replace my 300 monitor like.... i would have just bought a new asus monitor but i don't now. but i dont buy a different brand because i really like asus everything i have is already asus. so yeah... pretty bummed out right now

1,gexl4f,ASUS,1,2020/05/07 17:54:46,Afternoon,Zephyrus S GX701 Black Laptop Screen - but displays on external monitors fine? Hi all A little while back as I was using my Zephyrus laptop I heard a very quiet popping/static sound my laptop screen went black. I've tried draining the battery cannot remove on this model booting in 30 second increments but I've had no luck. I'm fearing that the laptop screen burnt out but I'm wondering this might be a pinched display cable instead? If I connect an external monitor it's working just fine so I'm not worried it's the graphics card. I had updated drivers factory reset it no luck. I'm very apprehensive about attempting an RMA given COVID19 the recent stories posted from users.. I'm wondering it's worthwhile dissemble check the cable the screen. Just curious anyone has had a similar experience this is most likely a cable failure a screen burnout or something else. This is a new purchase from January so I'm really hoping something hasn't completely given out already.

At first she would get an average of 40 fps a minimum of 29 after we tweaked some settings in Nvidia Control Panel tweaked as in copied my settings she got an average of 70 fps. We have the same game settings same Nvidia settings she still is some fps behind me. She did everything we could think of including updating Nvidia Driver update Windows latest release did the whole registry import set the game priority high this one in particular did nothing improve framerate . Our laptops were bought in the same month so it's not an age related problem. x200B Here are our specs My specs My specs 2 Her specs Her specs 2 And here are some print screens of the benchmarks My benchmark Her benchmark In her current benchmark her refresh rate is set 60 Hz in the previous one it's set 144 Hz.

I barely dropped this laptop caught it last minute but the fall still damaged it because the front part of the screen fell off. I am super stressed out right now because this laptop is borrowed it’s imperative that I get it fixed i feel horribly bad. It didn’t fully fall off i didn’t get have a good look at the damage because I was in shock i just scrambled put the screen back in its place. It snapped back on easily it’s holding but the screen is staying black. Laptop makes fan noises/keys light up but the screen seems be dead. I’m not including pictures because it looks totally normal now like it never even fell so pics wouldn’t be very useful. 1. Does anyone know of an estimate of how much this could cost? 2. Is this an easy repair buy a new screen screw it on that I could attempt on my own ? 3. Do have a post/article redirect me the info I need? 4. I live in Montreal Canada. By chance do know a legit/trustworthy repair shop that is still open? Sorry for formatting as can guess I’m on mobile -

1,gemzpn,ASUS,5,2020/05/07 08:14:15,Morning,Boot issue screen stays black not every time  Hey guys i have an issue my ASUS G531GV i7-9750H 16GB RAM Intel UHD 630 RTX 2060 . For a few weeks now I encounter the problem that turned off for a while sometimes the first boot makes the keyboard on the laptop USB devices connected light up but there is no ASUS logo it stays semi-black as blacklight is on. Sometimes force shutdown starting it again fixes the issue. Sometimes it needs multiple up 5 restarts. And some days it boots like a charm. The laptop works great otherwise booting correctly there are no issues working/gaming it. The issue came up for the first time after I took it off the power used it for a presentation. One day I hooked it up an external screen when it had its hiccups. I dove into display settings it could not find the built- in screen. But after a restart everything was fine again. If I try force the issue by shutting on off multiple times I doesn’t occur. I updated the graphic drivers both intel nvidia. I checked via MyAsus too. I am now restoring the laptop as the issue came up ca. half a year after purchase bought in August 2019 in hope it’s something of a driveprogramme messing it up. Due the current world situation I would prefer not send it ASUS but I strongly think it’s a software issue. Any advice? Thanks in advance stay healthy guys.

1,gemanc,ASUS,2,2020/05/07 07:36:34,Morning,Zenbook 15 Flip external Monitor QHD Rant TLDR Question has anyone managed hook up an external monitor their Zenbook 15 Flip QHD or 4k in 60 Hz ? UX562FD x200B I recently started going Uni again do my Masters needed a new Notebook. The last notebook i owned was a Dell that i bought in 2011 ! that came both HDMI miniDP ports only used a desktop for the last 5 years. x200B I guess I fucked up by assuming that a modern laptop that came out that much later would have the ability hook up an external monitor transmit 4k images let alone QHD in 60Hz didn't do enough research. I was just really convinced by the rest of the specs compared other 2in1 notebooks. x200B So the somewhat premium notebook that i bough in 2020 for more than 1000 € can only power 1080p through the HDMI 1.4 port what the ASUS support told me which is the only way connect an external monitor. x200B No HDMI 2.0 released in 2013 ! No Video capabilities on either USB 3.1 ports. I guess that's easy or modern DP alt mode over USB 3.1 gen2 released in 2014! So far I was unable convince the Intel Graphics control panel allow me set a custom resolution of QHD at 60hz both the internal Intel HD 620 the Nvidia GTX 1050 maxQ should have enough power run 4k. there's even a version of the same model a 4k screen x200B Direct quote from the ASUS product page for the UX562FD Convenient connectivity A comprehensive set of high-performance I/O ports gives ZenBook Flip 15 the ultimate hassle-free connectivity for versatile flexibility whether ’re in the office or on the road. And the integrated gigabit-class Wi-Fi gives wired-equivalent network speeds — without the wires! x200B x200B Unfortunately the return period ended before I noticed the problem now i'm stuck it. So anyone managed get the notebook working an external monitor a higher resolution please let me know.

At first I thought it was a no-brainer that the G15 is better in everyway a cheaper price of 1500 CAD the latest AMD far better performance power consumption. But after doing some research watching online review on the G15 I realize that the G15 actually has a much worse built quality also some thermal issue. So the only upside of getting the G15 is better CPU performance slightly cheaper price I guess . So I would love hear what guys think. x200B M15 2019 vs G15 2020 View Poll

For some reason the touchpad does not work unless I uninstall Smart Gestures . However this means that I don't get any gestures which have become mandatory for me at this point. I was wondering anyone else has ever had this issue? I've overriding the Synaptics driver. The touchpad ends up working but I still get no gestures. I've tried uninstalling all touchpad/keyboard drivers rebooting. This didn't help either. I've also tried updating the latest version of Smart Gestures which doesn't help. One thing I noticed is that even when the touchpad is functioning albeit without the gestures I try press Fn F9 enable the touchpad all I get is a message that the Touchpad is disabled. The settings for the touchpad in Windows 10 Settings app don't seem have any affect either. But when I change mouse settings through control panel it does. I'm at my wit's end here. I tried everything I can think of so any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm running the latest version of Windows 10 on the Asus N550JK-DS71T.

0,gea2zy,ASUS,1,2020/05/06 16:52:00,Afternoon,AX3000 AX56U So I just upgraded my network the ASUS AIMesh system using 2 AX3000s a single AX56U between them. I have 3 floors multiple devices. While this is certainly overkill for the size of my house I could have been fine just a single AX3000 this system will carry me into a new home next year which will likely be a lot larger. With that said I understand all 3 feature 1GB Wan 4 GB LAN ports. My question is why on the router interface it is showing 100MBPS for all 4 LAN ports? I should probably just go test see what speeds I should be getting connected directly this laptop which should have 1GB Lan port but I'm running CAT7 cables directly into a FireTV RJ45 adapter a Panasonic Tough-book in my office for work a DECA adapter that wires the other 2 routers through COAX. I know the DECA cap at 100mbps I know the tough-book is likely throttled I don't have admin access change it it even features the 1GB Lan but are the Fire TV adapters really only 10/100? Ultimately could it be the router needs the ports reconfigured? Why have the capability they are capped no way change it? I can not find a setting on the router interface adjust this. Not sure anyone has had similar experience. Any help appreciate. I may just be misunderstanding something here.

If the laptop goes sleep once or twice I’ll have problems the keyboard no longer operational. No key but the power button works. The only way get it work again is unplug the power cord hold down the power button the laptop off keep holding until it powers up then off again. Then on restart it’ll go through it’s memory disk check all will be well. Support on this was really of no help. Now the RGB keyboard is glitching. The X key is the only key that somewhat works. If I do the rainbow aura effect it’ll either not light or be off from the keys around it. If all other keys are orange it’ll be red. If all other keys are cyan it’ll be dark blue. If I do static green it’ll be off. It just seems like it’s off beat the rest. Any idea what do sync it back up? This laptop has had no previous damage. No drops no spills or falls.

I've been using OPolar vacuum coolers on all of my previous laptops but none seem work the design of the pro duo. All of the cooler models that I found require either a flat resting surface or room on the laptop itself for the cooler hatch/hook onto. The problem is the surface directly adjacent the fans on the pro duo is the second screen so the second option would not work unless I'm ok having something obstruct part of the screen--I'm not. I'm hoping someone here has found a vacuum cooler option that works for this laptop model can give a recommendation. Thanks!

I’m assuming hostname is the domain I updated so we’ll say example.domain.us. I’m assuming username password are the randomly generated credentials for the domain. With those plugged in I get an authentication failed. PS1 script still works so I know creds are still good kinda at a loss.

1,gdkk0s,ASUS,1,2020/05/05 13:27:10,Afternoon,AiMesh router instability w/ 2 nodes - halp? Okay I've been searching all over can't find a good answer. I have one Asus RT-AX88U as my primary router two RT-AX92U as AiMesh nodes connected via WiFi. The AX88U is basically dead center in the house on the main floor. In the living room feeding all the TV devices one PC via Ethernet all its Ethernet ports full. One AX92U is at one end of the house on the main floor Dining room in the very front corner of the house mostly acting as a WiFi--Ethernet bridge for an Ethernet-connected speakestereo more than anything but it gives WiFi coverage that side of the house better. The other AX92U is literally as far away as can get from the other AX92U - in the very opposite corner of the house in the basement home office. The annoying thing is that this node prefer connect the other AX92U rather than the AX88U that is much closer! I was trying use it bring more stable connection the multiple computers in the home office - connecting via Ethernet this node. But this node off I get WiFi speeds sufficient saturate my internet connection 100 Mbps but I turn on the node my speeds drop 5 Mpbs! Because it's connecting - badly - the other AX92U at the far end of the house. Anyone know of a way force the AiMesh nodes both connect the main router rather than one attempting piggyback off the other when it's a far worse signal? If I turn the dining room AX92U off then turn on the office one it of course connects the main router. But I turn the dining room one back on the office node switches connecting it instead.

Hey all as the title implies I have 4 Ram modules 8GBx4. They are all G.Skill Trident Z 3200Mhz. I have the Asus TUF x570 Plus Wifi. I was always able see control my DRAM RGB module on until a few days ago where I no longer am able see/control it. I can't see it in Asus Aura Asus Armoury Crate or G.Skill Trident Z. I see the ram light up but do not have access it. Is there anything else I should/can do fix this? Steps Taken I re-installed Asus Aura several times while using REVO uninstaller remove the registry keys. I even installed the G.Skill Trident Software several recommendations not it sees the DRAM but cannot control it. Ran through power cycles. Valorant seems be giving issues the lighting control.

But local stores only sell the 48WHr battery version. I'm not sure why - they just told me that the 90WHr battery isn't meant for the European market which isn't it just that 90WHr makes it last longer? Why wouldn't it be for the European market do we not use laptops as much? Confusing... Anyways. I'll be using my laptop on the go a lot so I really could use the bigger battery. Is it possible get a laptop that ships the 48WHr battery later replace the battery the 90Whr version? I'm a bit of a tech noob so sorry it's a ridiculous question... Thanks for any all advice in advance! Also anyone know 48WHr 90WHr is a big difference? To me it seems big but maybe I'm wrong?

My current RAM 16GB 8GBx2 DDR4/3200MHz Dual Channel Memory Patriot Viper Elite I have a question specifically about the RAM I install onto my motherboard. When looking at my user guide it says According Intel CPU spec DIMM voltage below 1.35V is recommended protect the CPU. I also printed out the QVL qualified vendors list help me search for. However I noticed there were only three options when it came sticks a voltage score below 1.35 the list is dominated by 1.35V sticks the three that were lower aren't available for sale at 3200MHz. This also led me realize my current sticks are 1.35V So my question has become Is it OK install 1.35V when the user guide specifies recommendations for a voltage below 1.35V?

Today I tried turn it on for the millionth time when plugged in it miraculously works! Thing is I don’t know absolutely anything about computers I don’t know there’s something I can do know what was or is wrong it will happen again or what may have caused it fail in the first place. I really can’t take it tech support because of the lockdown this brand isn’t available in my country. So anyone has gone through something like this I’d appreciate any advice!
2,gcw6vq,ASUS,0,2020/05/04 11:06:14,Morning,Owners of ROG Strix G531GU does your laptop also perform like this out of the box? Is this normal? Hi! Last month I bought the G531GU-AL012 i7 9750H 1660 ti 16GB single channel RAM for both gaming being able have good performance in general for various university tasks 3D digital art etc. but I was rather surprised at how underwhelming the laptop performed at first.. The CPU was only going at 3GHz instead of 4GHz as I had previously seen in reviews such I thought I was losing on performance. Did your laptop also perform this way? I used Throttlestop Speed Shift the CPU higher clock but that meant it would overheat 95C sometimes 97C at full fan speed. I could only undervolt it down -65mV although the difference in temperature was barely 4C after that the Throttlestop bench would give me errors games like BDO would crash after a minute while many posts reported their G531GU could go down -125mV great temps performance. Also tried playing around the Turbo power limits but I found nothing that could help me so I reverted it back normal. Is something wrong my device? Will dual channel RAM help it perform better at the stock 3GHz that it runs at? Any way I can still get good performance at 3.5-4GHz without melting my system? I'm very unconfident in repasting any sort of chip

1,gcvqhn,ASUS,1,2020/05/04 10:40:21,Morning,Audio amplification source-switching issues in ROG Strix AMD motherboards I've reached out on the Asus forums without success have attempted some diagnostic troubleshooting work myself minimal success so I thought I'd reach out here. I have a ROG Strix x570-e motherboard fully-updated Realtek audio drivers via Armoury crate no comment on that piece of frightening software . The difficulty I've had is in getting amplification settings stick for the audio out sources I have on my computer - a set of headphones from the front audio jack a set of powered speakers from the back stereo line out. Specifically I've had toggle off the 'detect audio jack' 'disable front panel popup dialog' advanced settings in the included ROG-themed Realtek audio console have the computer switch automatically between headphones when they're plugged in the speakers when the headphones are no longer plugged in . Weird given the settings I toggled off would suggest the opposite would happen now but it works. The only persistent trouble I'm having now is that the sound via my headphones is too low. The detected resistance through the headphones is putting it at a level that is low enough that the audio console automatically switches 'performance' AKA low audio amplification level when I plug in my front panel headphones but it's too quiet for my tastes. Even when I manually switch 'powerful' or 'extreme' amplification after plugging in the headphones the settings don't stick - they reset after I unplug the headphones plug them back in. Meanwhile the external speakers plugged into the back panel default 'extreme' amplification which is utterly insane given they're powered speakers are plenty loud - at too high an amplification level they're on the verge of distortion even on the lowest PC volume setting. Changing this setting 'performance' in the audio console amplification settings low level doesn't stick either. Anyone have a solution this issue? Realtek drivers are nary impossible find correctly install these days it seems. Additionally the Microsoft Store refuses install Realtek Audio Console separately from my Armoury crate whose tentacles have worked their way into my machine so much that removing them has broken some functionality in the past I've had reformat my boot drive get Aura sync work properly so I'm wary of following random people's advice on registry cleaning or uninstallers for drivers.

The touchpad on my asus A555L laptop has popped out on the side when researching the problem i found that it could possibly be a swollen battery. What are the signs for that specifically what should i do it really is a swollen battery? This is quite an old laptop around 4 years of use the problem of the touchpad popping out is not exactly recent. I first noticed it maybe a year ago when it was just one corner coming slightly loose having a harder time clicking it feels like there is some push back but it has gradually gotten worse see At first i thought it wasn't a big deal but i barely ever use my touchpad always use a usb connected mouse so it couldn't have been aggresive handling of the touchpad. Reading up online it seems it could possibly be a swollen battery which looks pretty dangerous. I don't really know how long i would lose my pc i had send it in for repairs exams coming up this would pose a mayor problem. What do guys think?

Yes i know the keyboard layout is a bit different but there is an ON-Screen Keyboard option on Windows the second screen is a touch cant we just drag that keyboard make it a touch keyboard? no one has talked about it.... 3. How is the build quality? I really consider build quality as I won't be upgrading again for at around 4-5 years? Do think it will last that long? as Asus didn't mention military durability on this product 4. How are the viewing angle can someone share a picture from a normal position? I know it might sound a bit weird but I can't test the laptop will need directly buy due current conditions so I am really confused. I mostly use my laptop on a bed by placing a hard cushion/blanket under it make it a little up till me thighs 5. I use Virtual box Linux can we slide the terminal onto the smaller screen? 6. I am not a hardcore gamer but would like play games like COD warzone Fortnite or a few simple games. The max I would play is for an hour that too only on weekends. Will this laptop be able run those? At last Thank have any recommendations or suggestions I would like hear them

11,gc9xmx,ASUS,30,2020/05/03 09:07:27,Morning,Asus software is the worst experience I ever had Over 7 hours I wasted trying get Armoury Crate or Aura control recognize RAM motherboard RGB. Installing uninstalling cleaning up your fucking shitty installers by scourging registry windows files because your programs can't event uninstall their own shit. x200B I just can't understand how can't afford decent fucking dev team write software? x200B EDIT Decided install Icue see it works. I am now able control ASUS RGB lights via Icue but NOT via Armour Crate. WTF Asus? x200B x200B EDIT 2 In addition the above issues Armour Crate prevented the CPU cores from idling. Usually Zen 2 processors or 3900x specifically in my case idle at 0.9-1.1v ramp up 1.4v or above when under use. For the past few days I noticed that 2 out of the 12 cores where stuck at 4.1ghz all the time at idle I would sit at 1.4v. So I decided do a fresh windows installation monitor core idle voltage after each software install see what was keeping the cores active. So upon fresh windows install the cores would idle at 0.9v after installing majority of software games I use run in the background it would idle at 1.1v. I created restore point before installing Armour Crate installed Armour crate which immediately recognized the motherboard ram...good. Next I check my idle voltage for the CPU its stuck at 1.4 again....not good x200B I run restore I am back 1.1v idle. So I try Aura instead it recognized motherboard ram immediately. Unlike Armour Crate Aura did not raise my idle voltages tho. So I am going set the RGB like of my choice hopefully never have open it again. x200B

The device is 4K touchscreen the touchscreen works very smoothly as does the pen. However there is a sort of horizontal invisible line along the length of the centre of the screen where the pen glitches crossed on. The pen glitches studders onto the other side of said boundary does not write or register on this faulty area. I dont think the issue is the screen as this area works fine finger control. If i press hard enough the pen occasionally i get a registry. Is this a hardware issue the pen or the screen. Can anyone help?

Like the Corsair H115i AIO... that simply doesn't work cannot be recognised. x200B I tried every tip in the book about 5-6hrs of research reading.... nothing worked it couldn't be controlled it wouldn't even be recognised. As soon as it was plugged back into the old board... worked flawlessly as before. x200B So a word of warning people considering buying one of these boards... do your research first don't touch it there's even a hint of a compatibility issue. x200B I used ASUS boards almost exclusively from mid 2000's after Abit went under until the end of 2018... only used their GPU's until I suffered from the terrible issues plaguing the R9 280X. But their products their quality control has taken a massive tumble... i thought I'd give them one last chance... it was a mistake. x200B Next board will either be an X570 Gigabyte or MSI... Once I check the USB controllers used on them.

I have this problem since I updated my radeon driver for the vega 8 inside daily crashes ever since. The bsod code is THREAD STUCK IN DEVICE DRIVER which translates something wrong in the device driver. I once did uninstall DDU both the gtx 1050 driver vega 8 driver reinstalled it all but unfortunately the problem still persist. And that's only the bsod problem.. Another one again from the red team every time I update my driver say from version 19 version 20 the moment my laptop goes sleep the display would suddenly wake up at full brightness the driver would got downgraded back version 19. This blows my mind. Another thing because of this problem my vulkan driver got uninstalled somehow. I know this from launching vulkaninfo command nothing pops out. Also I can't launch dota 2 vulkan even though I game on my gtx 1050. This blows my mind. And dang while playing dota I often got this weird stutters where the game stops for 1-2 seconds. I am able move my cursor during the period of the stutter. I'm not sure the problem caused by my graphic card or the whole laptop itself at this point.

I unistalled it but now I have problems install it again I really need this software because this solved my FPS drop problem in simulator games. I downloaded Armoury Crate Service then downloaded Armoury Crate Beta from Windows Store. The problem is that when I start Armoury Crate the windows pops up as it is loading then disappears. I cannot find the Armoury Crate software on my laptop within the program files but multiple uninstalls have not solved this problem. There is only an exe for Armoury Crate Service Armoury Crate User Session Helper. I tried deleting every ASUS program file but some of it cant be deleted because something is apparently using it some ASUS processes could not be killed from Task Manager. The Armoury Crate software did not come preinstalled I did not use it until about a month ago but it solved my FPS drop problem in simulators so I really need this app. What should I do before doing a clean reinstall of Windows? x200B Thanks for any answers in advance x200B EDIT sometimes I see Armoury Crate as a process in Task Manager when expanded it reveals a process called Runtime Broker

1,gbz2ms,ASUS,2,2020/05/02 18:58:13,Afternoon,GA502DU/GU502DU New BIOS 302 Hello all I'm not asking for tech support. Merely wanting document my experience this laptop. Since day one I've been having issues ranging from boot issues the infamous .39GHz/400MHz CPU clock bug. Been through all the BIOS's from version 203 at launch till version 300 just recently. Nothing has fixed my issues. One thing that I did that fixed my bootup issues ANY OS would infinitely load at the BIOS Windows spinning circle ubuntu static/frozen screen . I installed a secondary NVME drive in the second M.2 port only a 256GB Hynix NVME drive. I wiped the primary drive default Intel 660p 512GB installed Windows directly onto the Hynix then deleted the Intel from the boot options in the BIOS. Ever since doing this Windows boots up without issues. So I've been using the Intel as secondary game storage since apparently all 1TB M.2 drives aren't compatible I have a Crucial P1 1TB . A new BIOS version 302 has just been released Right when I finished installing the system restarted stayed on a permanent black screen. I was forced hold down the power button until the machine turned off but not long enough reset CMOS. Upon booting up it seemed boot fine but since the BIOS update reset my BIOS settings I got the infinite load bug back. Going into BIOS manually deleting the Intel drive from boot options immediately fixed my infinite load bug Windows booted up instantly. So far I'm testing the .39GHz/400MHz bug it's looking okay. I'll need go a couple of days see this will reoccur as the last time I reinstalled Windows for the 300 BIOS version it took about a week before the .39GHz bug came back. Not sure why. I make sure install everything I can for drivers/chipsets/ASUS services. I can not find anything related patch/release notes for this new 302 BIOS. So I figured I'd post my experience here see anyone else has similar or different experiences. x200B My warranty expires in a couple of weeks so the .39GHz/400MHz bug comes back I'm just going go ASUS support request an exchange for a different model. This has been a complete nightmare of a laptop use honestly wish I never bought it. x200B Edit 1 Wanted give a quick update. So far I've been playing tons of different games on the laptop primarily Valorant Guild Wars 2. So far no thermal throttling issues nor stuck clock speed have occurred since the 302 BIOS install. This may be the fix for our issues finally but we won't know for sure until more people try it.

My computer recognizes the monitor I'm able drag windows over volume is trying come from the monitor but no image shows up. Also the factory reset can only be done through the menu which is very unhelpful here because I cannot see anything. I guess my two questions are 1. Is there another way factory reset? I've held down the power button for various amounts of times ranging from 1 -5 minutes nothing happens. 2. Has anyone else had this problem? The only bit of advice I have seen online is just let it die but that could take days.... Link for reference

I'd prefer my phone stay connected the 89 because I spend most of my time in the office where it's located my phone is wifi 6 capable speed tests are faster when connecting the 89. If I'm on the other side of the house closer the 68U that's fine connect that but when I come into my office it's staying connected the 68U according the web interface clients list for that node the signal strength is much weaker. Does it have a certain criteria it looks for a client before handing it off another AP or can I specifically tell it somehow prefer connect the 89 instead of the node?

I just bought the Zephryus G14 AMD Ryzen 9 16GB memory RTX 2060 etc. I bought this as a replacement my old laptop which was a Lenovo flex 4 or something I don’t remember. I’ve read many reviews watched countless videos on the laptop. Youtube reviews all say its the best thing in the world etc but some reviews from other people seem agree but have flaws that the youtube videos never pointed out. One of these problems include the screen going black having force shut down the laptop. How would I fix that out of the gate or is it just some manufacturing error for those laptops? Also I keep this laptop as long as possible. What fan settings should I use. For normal task some gaming obviously Some games include League of Legends Minecraft maybe some R6. Nothing too intensive.

I built a new Ryzen 9 3900X system the ASUS Pro WS X570-ACE Workstation board 64GB of G.Skill Ripjaws 32BG DDR40-3600Mhz RAM. When I first got it I could not get it post at all the memory above 2666MHz. But using the DRAM Calculator for Ryzen I found a set of timings that it now runs at 3600MHz. However it still does that triple boot sometimes where it resets up 3 times before actually coming on but this time it has not reset the memory timings works at the higher speed. I also have 2 NVIDIA cards installed a 770FX 1st slot a RTX 2060 Super 2nd slot . The system is a Linux KVM server the RTX as pass-through VMs. However some reboots don't complete hang I can tell this as the fans on the RTX 2060 fire up full for a couple seconds then will turn down at the end of post the fans stay on full it never posts. In addition the cards for some reason it has twice randomly decided change the iommu groups for the video cards caused the Fedora linux system lockup on boot since it is blacklisting the 2nd card by its ID I have rescue the system. Mind I have only had the board a couple weeks. Finally I have tried get the Realtek Management work I did get it be visible via the ASUS Control Center express got the mouse control but the screen went blank when that happened. /. I can't figure out how update the Firmware on it either as the control center software expects an img file the board provides a .exe batch flash remotely on a system loaded windows I run linux. Has anyone else had these kinds of issues this board? I am very close a return on this board I can't get it stable. Thanks in advance.

On my previous setup I had a USB 3.0 HDD kids movies that I could stream any TV in the house. I also have a CCTV camera system hooked up a LAN port that allowed me access my cameras from my phone via an app. When I installed my AC68U right out of the box I hooked everything up the same way. I noticed that the USB section is grayed out I can't click on the little plus sign but I do see my HDD. Anyway none of my devices/TV's see the SMB share drive. Also my camera system says can't connect the internet. It seems like a simple block maybe a firewall setting? But I've spent three days emails Asus no response.

1,gb83u1,ASUS,0,2020/05/01 16:36:35,Afternoon,Armoury Crate - Zephyrus GX531GW Hey everyone. First post here on Reddit. I'm having trouble my i7-8750H thermals on my Zephyrus GX531GW equipped a RTX 2070 . While playing some hardcore games like BF5 or Red Dead Redemption 2 my processor goes 95 usually stays around 90 degrees Celsius I have some thermal throttling. I already changed the thermal paste Thermal Grizzly properly cleaned the vents this laptop gets so much dust on the vents . I saw that when I put Armoury Crate on ''Performance'' profile I get way better temps around 5 or more degrees difference on CPU compared ''Turbo'' profile. Also when I change between this 2 profiles I can see on the image/graphic that GPU performance stays the same but there is a boost on CPU Performance what is probably making my thermals go higher . Question 1 Turbo mode on Armoury Crate is an overclock on my CPU? How can I see the values from Performance Turbo profiles. I can't find them anywhere. Question 2 Manual Mode has by default GPU Base clock offset 100/120Mhz Memory clock offset 150/200mhz. This 100 150 values are overclocked or are normal? I dont get this numbers... And what manual mode does my CPU performance since I can only control the fan speed? Question 3 The manual profile let me put the fans up 110%. Is that safe this extra 10% ? Thanks! Performance Profile Turbo Profile Manual Profile Intel XTU

But it was 1400 had only two ports one needed charge the thing! no discrete graphics. Not mention that butterfly keyboard. I took it back looking for something a bit more utility almost nonexistent stock at the store grabbed an ROG GA502du the Ryzen 7 16gb RAM 512gb SSD a 120hz screen for 950. While out of the box the laptop left a bit be desired some tweaking it's a phenomenal deal that shouldn't be overlooked. Keyboard Touchpad The keyboard has been reviewed as being a bit 'soft' low-travel. Between this the butterfly MacBook keyboard my Dell XPS 7590 among others this keyboard is nothing short of excellent on my machine. Travel is smooth consistent accuracy is great. A strange occurrence I've found is that there is some coil whine on the ROG when the keyboard backlight is off gets quieter as it gets brighter basically silent on full keyboard brightness. The touchpad is nice accurate but it is plastic so while it's very comparable even more responsive than the XPS. Clicking is uniform I just wish that there was a bit less drag on it but as others have noted finger oils do make it smoother grossly more pleasant after a day or two of use. I/O Definitely a nice departure from the Mac. HDMI 2.0 lets my finally be able easily hook up a 4k60 monitor Freesync even seems work! I was very surprised find that the onboard DAC/AMP is a lot better than expected for the price. For almost half the price of the XPS this laptop has an honest headphone amp which the Dell does not drives my Audeze LCD-2 headphones easily cleanly - something I only expected get from a Mac I'm glad not need an external amp. USB-C A are nice have but as this is an AMD laptop there is no Thunderbolt 3 which would have been nice. The barrel jack is a bit old-school high-watt USB-C charging would be an upgrade but hey 950. Performance Heat Here I made some changes. I upgraded the RAM 24gb by replacing the 8gb single stick 16 8 soldered onboard. I also added a 256gb SSD I had laying around. The cooling solution on this computer is really great I was impressed by how many heat pipes there were which even were connected the MOSFETs thermal paste. Looking at Dell! The Dell though it had a faster i7 actually performed worse as the MOSFETS heat soaked the laptop it thermal throttled significantly. On the ASUS I replaced the thermal paste on the CPU GPU Kryonaut took off those ridiculous vent blockers on the bottom of the case am hovering at 35-40C all day streaming 4k video. Gaming hasn't been tried yet. The Nvidia driver that comes the computer is very problematic I fixed this by switching the studio driver in Geforce did a clean install no more BSODs so far. It runs cool quiet has great battery life now that the fans aren't strangled. Display Audio The display is fine. The 120hz refresh rate low response time are very nice animations are buttery smooth - it feels even smoother than the MacBook when just scrolling around in Edge which I thought I'd never see. Brightness is lackluster colors are muted but it's reasonably sharp viewing angles are very good. Somehow it looks much nicer more vibrant when watching Netflix so while I'll probably upgrade the screen it's good for now. Audio is very good as well. The down-firing speakers are better than the XPS the Mac although the angle of the drivers mutes the treble a bit. A common theme for this laptop the audio is a lot better than the price would suggest. Feel free let me know have any questions on it! I'm very pleasantly surprised by the ASUS am using it for my home desktop. x200B EDIT I've also noticed that the panel isn't necessarily as bad as it looks out of the box. Some calibration in Windows the Radeon driver do a lot bring up the brightness contrast saturation. For mine -5 brightness 112 contrast 120 saturation looks good my eyes. Still about the last screen would do color sensitive work on but it's a big improvement from the stock calibration.

1,gb6762,ASUS,2,2020/05/01 14:48:52,Afternoon,Asus TUF x570 Wifi - Wifi issue I'm getting abysmal rates from my onboard wifi card. Unfortunately because of the setup I have use wifi instead of a preferred LAN cable. I have a commercial grade Ubiquiti Wifi dish sitting about a foot above my wooden desk on a wall paired a commercial grade switch router all connected shielded cable - I get great speeds on other devices so I know the network is not the issue. . Underneath the desk is the computer - the antennae cable that comes the board isn't long enough reach above the desk so it's mounted on the wall behind the desk about half a foot under the top of the desk. . If I pull the desk away from the wall the signal is slightly better. I'm getting around 16ms ping around 30mbps down while my phone wandering around the house several meters away from the dish through several walls is able achieve 7ms ping over 120Mbps down. I've updated the drivers tried play the settings - not sure what I'm doing though. Is it possible it's too close? Do I need replace the Antennae? Theoretically the onboard wifi should give me baseline AC speeds correct? Any help welcome.

I Ordered from a retailer from Sweden. I been reading about issues these cards. So I wrote ASUS support got this mail Unfortunately then we do not have service directly through us. Please check that your graphic card is one of the affected cards here If it is then please contact the store where the card was purchased from for warranty processing so that the screws can get changed. So then I wrote the retailer in Sweden got this mail Asus offers a free upgrade of the mounting screws. You can get these by contacting an ASUS service center. In Europe the Nordic countries Asus defers the retailer as they have no service centers. We have not received any screws for upgrade from Asus. It is therefore impossible for us offer this service. We can of course offer standard warranty service. I would like point out that the current issue regarding the mounting pressure of the screws is not a warranty issue. It is simply a fix improve the cooling capablities of the card. If have any other issues covered by warranty performance issues actual measurable overheating crashing etc we will be more than happy replace the card for . Then I wrote ASUS support again showed them what the retailer replied got this mail from ASUS support Your Retailer will have send the card in for service where the screw is then replaced. unfortunately the screws will not be sent out retailer or end-users. So this means im stuck. Retailer don't consider this as a warranty issue ASUS support won't let end users send the card in it has be the retailer store that sends it in. So end users have no offer from ASUS after all since we can't send the card in our self. what do guys think? what can a end user do now?

Can disable RGB in bios? Like fully? I've read that there's indeed a shut off but the article mentioned only that it worked shut off RGB when the PC was shut down. Apparently it's on all the time otherwise? Seems kinda nuts. 2. Can disable the RGB for the mobo any other individual compent I guess Aura Sync? 3. If disabled the RGB for the mobo in Aura Sync then uninstalled that software would the mobo's firmware remember that setting? i.e. have effectively disabled RGB without even having Aura Sync installed.

0,gay2ul,ASUS,2,2020/05/01 07:43:55,Morning,Weird model number Asus laptop from Best Buy causing some confusion? I ordered this laptop before there were any reviews The features list mentions a backlit keyboard which I need so this seemed like a great deal. However like many of the new reviews note the laptop being shipped does not have this. Doing some digging while chatting Best Buy support I noticed that the model number listed on the site is X712DA but the model number on the laptop says M712D. The Asus box that the laptop comes in has both numbers listed. So did something get crossed in the inventory or labeling of the boxes? The BB support rep implied such saying I got the wrong laptop they will ship me the X712DA. ADDED Also noticing that I can't find the X712 variant listed on Asus' site anywhere?

2,gquhz8,thinkpad,7,2020/05/27 02:26:46,Night,Question - upgrading an x220 thinkpad Hi all I will preface this by saying that my hardware knowledge is very very limited. I have an x220 thinkpad 8gb of ram i5-2540M CPU 2.6GHz. I don't really game on this computer the games I do play are about 20 years old rpgs so I've never had an issue. I've ren Pro Tools 10 Photoshop cc 2015 no issues as well. Recently I started editing some basic videos for work even free software like Shotcut perform badly so I started looking into upgrading my hardware. I understand that getting another 8gb of Ram is essential but what else? Do I need an external graphic card setup? Is my processor strong enough handle this sort of upgrade? I'm on tight budget so any advice will be highly appreciated. Thank in advance.

2,gqtfdx,thinkpad,1,2020/05/27 00:54:18,Night,E495 build quality? Performance? Other suggestions? Hi! I'm trying decide I shall replace my desktop a thinkpad. As I don't game that heavily anymore. I'm leaning on buying a E495 because of the price AMD Ryzen processor integrated graphics.. But I have understood that the E series don't have the same build quality as T X series. I have a X240 atm love it. I think the build quality is really nice like the portability. Even an extended 48Wh battery. And I love the keyboard. It's awesome. So... How would the build quality be compared a X240? And especially the keyboard? And can swap it out between ANSI ISO layouts based in sweden ? And the performance I think 16GB memory would be enough for me. Processor also would be sufficent I think. I'm not really certain about the VEGA 10 graphics do all ryzen 7 have it? . I have one game that I regularly play. Company of heroes 2 . And would like play it in 1080p. I would love be able play other games but because of time other interest atm I don't really care that much about it. And for desktop use I would like be able drive a 4K external screen. Just be able use it as a desktop aswell. Also any good recommendation on a docking station for desktop use? I have almost entirely moved over Linux as main OS. Only windows for the gaming atm will probably switch that aswell along the road. And have any other recommendation for a price worthy thinkpad for my use case I would gladly hear about them! Thanks ahead of input! Extra info about my desktop for comparison Intel i7-6700K Non overclocked 16GB 3200MHz Ram RX 570 graphics Intel Z170 ITX motherboard TLDR How is the build quality of E495 especially keyboard? Can change between ANSI/ISO layout? Gaming performance of Ryzen 7 3700U graphics. 1080p Windows Linux? Desktop performance of Ryzen 7 3700U 4K Linux? Docking station? Other suggestions?

1,gqvvny,thinkpad,4,2020/05/27 04:13:11,Night,My ThinkPad X270 survived liquid spill over the keyboard. Just moments ago I accidentally spilled carbonated Cola on my X270's keyboard. I panicked shut it down threw a bunch of tissues a towel on it cleaned up the surface wipes alcohol then dried it an hairdryer. Unfortunately I think something is wrong the keyboard although it's usable the keyboard tends react differently as I'm pressing the keys repeatedly while holding them down while slightly relieving weight off the key but keep it down. I don't recall my ThinkPad reacted this way . Would a Lenovo warranty cover water spill? Is this damage permanent?

But a couple of weeks ago I bought an external monitor go it so that I could start coding but I have noticed that there is a subtle but very noticeable input delay in the monitor when I attach it. This is very noticeable when I watching something on Netflix or HBO Now. And I have tried everything fix it. From turning the monitor game mode turning off overdrive. Nothing works. I know it’s certainly a new issue since I had been using an external monitor in my grad office it worked perfectly on there. And still does. But that’s a FHD monitor this is a QHD. I was also on call Lenovo today for an hour today they determined that it’s not an issue the monitor but the laptop software asked me for 70 get help on that. And I cannot afford that. I am a student spent all I had on this monitor. Any help that can provide would be very very appreciated!

I plan upgrade the RAM eventually. Do I need add 8gig pair the 8 soldered or can I add 16? can I add an internal HDD or should i just plan use an external HDD/SDD back up all of my files handle photos/overflow from the 256G? Is the wifi chip soldered in the T495? I don't think I need bluetooth but curious it was an option down the road should I buy an extended warranty? I have an older ideapad never had any issues hoping get 5-10 years out of this which would outlast the warranty. thoughts? Thanks in advance!

Zero problem buying used prefer actually . I will be doing finance or something similar so. The goal is buy a cheap used machine pimp it out w/ upgrades. I'll be running Linux so idc abt games. Budget 800 upgrades but aiming for way less My ideal computer 4.5 hours battery life after upgrades rly important guys 5.5 lbs or less thinner but durability thinness Supported upgrades screen 1080p IPS ram 2 slots is fine SSD battery ? processor current gen i7 keyboard recommended trackpad recommended Durable/Last through college 14 15 model whichever can check off more boxes Stays cool I can reapply thermal paste necessary Thunderbolt nice but not a deal breaker it doesn't have it I will be carrying it around in a case w/ a mouse so I'm fine w/ carrying a small/light battery pack or whatever. I might not end up installing a new i7 but I feel like I should leave that as an option. I've seen people saying i5 because of battery life/heat little performance drop from i7 so that's looking more n more like what I'll do. Don't know much abt GPUs so I didn't say anything but it's a good addition plz lmk. !approve

1,gqrh7c,thinkpad,10,2020/05/26 22:06:33,Evening,Help me make my mind up Hi all me again. I can’t decide between a Thinkpad T480 L490 or E490. Or a Dell Latitude 7490. As before I’m looking for a laptop that doesn’t need be the absolute best but it would be nice get the fastest for my limited budget. And similarly while it would be nice have one built like a tank I think I’m going be happy anything better than my currently crumbling G50-70. It would be marvellous get a truly great keyboard but as I’m starting out from such a terrible one I think any of these options will please me. The T480 would be great but it’s over two years old now. Is that too old for a laptop? Will it be sluggish now? The L490 would be good but according notebookcheck.com it underperforms compared the E490. But it might be down sub-par drivers - has that been resolved? The E490 would be good as it apparently is plenty fast but I can’t get a clear indication of the difference in build quality between the L the E. that I wonder about the wisdom of the manufacturers extended warranties the L T models get compared the E. Finally the Latitude 7490. It’s apparently Thinkpad T480 level built an excellent keyboard a bit cheaper. While it apparently outperforms the T480 a fair bit competes the L/E490 it’s not a Thinkpad. And apparently runs hot. It doesn’t help that benchmarking seems make no sense between them all. Even all the machines benchmarked are i5s 8GB RAM the numbers seem all over the place. And I can’t tell one being 200 points higher than another is that much of a difference.

I bought a Thinkpad X1 Yoga 3rd gen a couple summers back I have had more problems this device than an old cheap ASUS laptop that I used daily for years. I first ran into some hardware problems where the M2 drive wasn't screwed in all the way where I had send it back for them repair the device as it was still under warranty received this error only a few weeks after the purchase . Now I am facing a software issue. Whenever I charge my laptop when the device is powered off the battery seems get no charge. I am assuming this is due software specifically Thunderbolt as I found a critical update for Thunderbolt on Lenovo's forums. However no matter how I try install these updates I run into fatal errors. I created a thread on Lenovo's forums but I have not heard anything after about 3 weeks. My device isn't under warranty so I don't see any other way get the support think would deserve after spending so much on a device. Any help on finding this support would be greatly appreciated.

Lenovo Vantage ver 4.12. 60% start charging at 40% has been what I have maintained for about the last three years now. Laptop is plugged in 95% of the time. I noticed the last few weeks I was down about 42% plugged in not charging about every 6 months or so I drop below the 40% range the notebook threshold kicks in charges back up 60%. Machine is powered down unplugged every night. This morning probably a couple of hours after booting up I noticed that the battery icon showed fully charged 100%. I did notice some excess heat coming from the right front where my palm rests this morning but task manager did not show anything unusual so I did not think too much about it. I now realize it was the battery charging. When I went look at Lenovo Vantage I could not find the battery threshold settings anymore. The machine is woefully out of date regarding updates etc. but that is another story. All browsers Bitdefender are up date. So is the version of LV 4.12 the problem or was I just not able find the threshold setting? TIA.

I have however noticed a potential problem - when under normal use the temperature is doing well under 50 the fans are not on but when I plug in the charger the temps jump up 70 degrees without any change in productivity it even stays there I close down everything! The keyboard doesn't get that warm but the fan kicks in which is a bit annoying it doesn't seem sustainable in the long run push 70 everytime I am charging. Does anyone else have this issue or have any tips on how fix it? EDIT When the charger is plugged in the CPU goes from 1700MHZ about 3200MHZ instantly but there is nothing in the task manager account for this in fact in task manager the load stays below 50% for the CPU Thank !

It has the 1600x900 display which going by the posts on here isn’t great is a TN panel. I have used a T460 for work it had the 1920 x 1080 IPS panel it looked great. Reading up on the screen swap it looks an easy enough swap however seems be an issue the display whitelist I have found this one on eBay they state in the listing that it’s OEM brightness should work Is there anything look out for when changing this? Can the sticker be reused or does it require a new one is there part numbers for both the sticker the plastic bezel in case I need replace either? I see another option is flash the BIOS which I wouldn’t mind doing as I’m not bad technical things but ideally I can avoid it then that would be preferred. Lastly is there a whitelist on WiFi cards? I’d be looking upgrade this too have any suggestions. Thanks in advance!

Ideally I'd use my P72 Quadro P4200 video as my primary machine. I looked at docks became both confused underwhelmed. At worst I plan travel two days per week I can plug a few things in.

I performed the following steps 1. Downloaded the most recent firmware update .iso for my laptop. 2. Converted that .iso file a .img file using geteltorito. 3. Wrote that .img file a USB drive using dd . 4. Added two files the FLASH directory on that USB drive LOGO1.GIF LOGO2.GIF both of which are the same graphic the dimensions 2560 x 1440 the same dimensions as my laptop screen . Each of those files are 7.7 kb large. 5. Went into the BIOS settings allowed BIOS rollbacks. 6. Booted my laptop using that USB drive selected the second option according the output performed the BIOS update. 7. Pressed enter at the end of the update allowed the laptop restart. Upon restarting the same red Lenovo rectangle was still there. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

My issue is that the brightness keys stopped working. I thought it could have been some update but I used a live iso for the original Xubuntu 20.04 release it also does not work it worked before . I also noticed that when I shutdown the laptop the screen stays on for a few seconds more before turning completely dark. That got me wondering it's a software/linux issue or the screen actually has some damage. The laptop has been basically off since last thursday everything was fine last wednesday including adjusting the screen brightness. Does anyone have any debugging tips? Thank for any help. --------------------------------- I managed fix this issue but I don't even know what happened exactly. I noticed that even when the laptop was not powered on I plugged in the charger the screen would turn on. It wouldn't have an image of course but it wouldn't be deep black. While plugged-in I powered on the laptop but kept pressing the power button. I imagined this would lead a factory mode or something. While still pressing the button the laptop turned on the lenovo logo didn't appear after 2 or 3 seconds it turned off but I noticed that the screen was not on anymore even when plugged in. When I entered the OS once more the brightness was working 
2,gqixxj,thinkpad,13,2020/05/26 12:43:40,Morning,X250 x220 or X1 carbon as a student machine So as we all know the x220 is the best choice for keyboard but for the price it works out about the same where I am I put the nitrocaster mod in it an IPS display. So now I'm looking at alternatives the x250 seems like a better deal except for the keyboard I've heard that the X1 carbon KB is different again. So my questions are these 1. Is the x250 a quality machine compared the x220? Any handicaps that should be noted? 2. Is the KB horrendous or meh or good for a modern KB? As I'm going be a student soon it's fairly important. 3. For the price should I just buy an older X1 carbon call it a day? Is the keyboard worse? The battery life would be much less than the x250 I would think. As an extreme alternative I could just try find a lithium battery for my 1161 use some kind of micro Linux distro...... But it is 20 years old. Any input appreciated

Run Debian GNU/Linux LXQT or similar lightweight DE. Should be suitable for 4 more years considering web browsers keep wanting more more resources. Kid does not have any ipad or tablet. We feel a computer may be better suited as it puts the child in discipline in having a dedicated workplace the computer screen remains at a better distance than a tablet. Kid dislikes using tablet / mobile for classroom meetings because of the small screen size the videos of participants are very small compared a regular monitor. 1.

Unfortunately I'm unable get external monitors work the TS3 - only one monitor is detected despite the desktop being extended it doesn't display a picture. Everything works as expected on a MacBook Pro so I think most of the basic stuff should be working. I've tested in both wayland Xorg on Fedora 32 on both the T470 T490 similar results. x200B Is anyone using the CalDigit TS3 successfully e.g. dual 2K monitors on the T470 or T490?

OS Windows 10 Intel XTU 6.5.1.360 CoreTemp 1.15.1 Cinebench 20 BIOS is up--date. I would like undervolt the part due battery power temperature. Of course the device should also retain its performance. It's about Office graphics sometimes games ala Diablo 3 or Stardew Valley. I was able bring the offset -0.100V here Cinebench XTU are running in the first tests. From -0.105V my device freezes. The temperature of almost 100 is quite high but I didn't know before what the temperatures are like this device. I did not dare use the internal GPU TDP. Actually the temperatures of almost 100 should become less load as soon as I bring the offset -0.100V but the temperatures stay just below 100 . Is this due Energy/UEFI settings? Actually I wanted undervolt the MX150 but without CPU it doesn't make much sense. Idle power supply 50 54 I had now once pressed Turbo Boost Short Power Max Turbo Boost Power Max each 15W instead of default 44W. Sure CPU is now cooler 77 instead of 97 but of course a loss of power I read the tables correctly. Also Core Voltage Offset -0 100V. Where exactly the difference between the two Power Max values is I don't know... Thanks!

I've been using a Thinkpad P53 for work/travel but I find it a bit heavy for me so I'm looking at trying the Thinkpad X1 Yoga. I considered the regular Yoga series but the specs are a bit below what I'd need for work I prefer the Thinkpad keyboard mouse. I've been reading the reviews of the Gen 3 vs the Gen 4 what features have changed so on I'm not finding too much different between them that bothers me. However when I look on the Lenovo site they say the Gen 4 has up 18 hours of battery life whereas the Gen 3 only has up 15.4 hours of battery life. Yet most of the reviews I've read say that the Gen 4 battery life is a bit lower than the Gen 3 though that may just be a result of different screen choices . Does anyone have any experience using eitheboth who could comment on what the real battery life usage is of this systems? Also anyone has any experience running Linux on either is one better than the other as I've read some Lenovos have trouble running Linux depending on the model BIOS. Thanks.

Right now I have a base tier but client-provided 2019 MacBook Air for on-site stuff since its modern portable stylish. For heavy design editing I use a now-year-old Acer Nitro 5 which screams I'm a giant child that plays video games but it gets the editing done without any hiccups. Only issue is sheer size.

I found some laptop which I think they are enough good for my needs but I'm asked they really worth it. I've found a T460P for €700 an i7-6820HQ / 16 Go DDR4 / 256 Go SSD / 940 MX In benchmarks the CPU look like be at the same score as i5 8th gen The others Thinkpad are the T480 I can't find it under €700 in Europe i5-8265U / 8 Go DDR4 / UHD 620. P43s which is the same as the T480 but a Quadro P520 in addition for €950. I'm wondering the battery on these models are okay but I'm open buy extra batteries in case I need it I will encounter thermals throttleling issues ? Some people talk me about the P50/1 Quadro graphics for CAD but this laptop look be heavy 3Kg 15 6 inches screen is a bit too large in my opinion. Thanks in advance for your advices

The left hinge actually gave out a while ago shortly after a drop I just went full ghetto-mode removing the bezel letting the right hinge do the work. That one finally gave out on me tonight while I was watching TV in bed. I found this video on the repair process which recommends buying new hinges super-gluing them into place. My problems that are 1. the area connecting the screw the top cover assembly looks worn/stripped for one of the screws I'm not sure that would be a problem or not 2. the replacements parts often don't come new screws two of mine are wobbly 3. This was like a 100 refurb anyway I really don't put more money into this device than necessary. I don't mind a 25 repair but it's going just be a recurring issue maybe I should buy another beater anyway So I'm wondering this will have a chance of working I just try super-gluing without getting replacement hinges or the hinge replacement would be strictly necessary. I'm also curious anyone has had experience this issue this or similar models has any wisdom impart. Thanks for any advice I'm by no means a computer repair expert so it's all appreciated.

I used a ThinkPad AC adapter slim tip in my office but am not going the office now for obvious reasons . All of a sudden it stopped charging yesterday but the USB-C adapter still charges my phone. I switched back a slim-tip AC adapter it charges fine. I thought perhaps it was a hardware problem from the stress of inserting removing the charging cable several times a day over the past few months but I inserted a USB-C flash drive into the USB-C port Windows 10 makes a sound acknowledging that something was inserted but fails acknowledge the drive. The same drive works as an OTG device on my phone or as a USB-A device in my ThinkPad. Of course it still could be that one pin is broken on the USB port but I am now wondering it's a software problem that can be solved by this update? Before I try it I thought I'd ask here also report it in case anyone else has had the same problem. I also think it's really nice that this machine has two different ways in which it can be charged although I wish they weren't literally next each other.

5,gpx2h2,thinkpad,12,2020/05/25 12:46:02,Morning,My First Thinkpad Impressions Bye Bye Elitebook Recently I have received my Thinkpad! But first one minute of silence for my old HP Elitebook 840 G2. It served me very well! It is still a great laptop everything works fine it still can grasp most of the tasks in my workflow. However I wanted upgrade a few components screen Thunderbolt USB-C charging etc I got a relatively good deal guys inspired me go Thinkpad. Here are the specs of my Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen. x200B As can see I picked Ubuntu 20.04 that new GNOME looks gorgeous on the 2K panel! A few impressions on the Thinkpad - I was surprised that the fingerprint works out-of-the-box I think I only needed update the firmware. - The speakers do not work properly the bass is definitely missing but I saw that the guys from Launchpad are working on the issue. It seems there is a workaround but it is not a big deal for now. - Face unlock doesn't work. I tried install howdy but it didn't recognize the sensor. With the fingerprint working fine I didn't invest more time. - The keyboard is amazing! I hate the position of Ctrl key though hopefully I will get used it. - The screen is fantastic 2K but I lowered the resolution 2048x1152. I tried 2K fractional scaling 1080p without scaling but I settled 2048x1152 it doesn't hurt the battery that much I can still put a lot things on the screen. - It is super light this was one of the main reason I chose go X1 Carbon instead of T490. - There are two Thunderbolt ports both can be used for charging. But Lenovo why not putting one of them on the right side so I don't have pass the charging cable around? O - I was waiting for 6-core version got very disappointed the fact that 6-core version will not be available in Europe. Therefore at the end of February I ordered this one. - That i7 is amazing for quick bursts surfing the web is flawless. However as soon as I start tasks like compilation on all cores it starts throttle gets warm. I guess it is normal for laptops especially for ultrabooks it is something I anticipated before I purchase it. After all it is 14nm technology / My goal is bring the portability space efficiency the next level. Here are a few ideas in that regard - I ordered a vertical stand from AliExpress Hopefully no or minimal modifications it should hold my Thinkpad like this That way I plan save a lot of space on the table for my electronics. - Depending on my needs in the future I may buy Aorus Gaming Box. It is a small box integrated power supply but I couldn't find it neither in Switzerland nor in France. - In meantime I ordered a dock so I can use a single cable for charging the peripherals. - For long trips I plan order this Xiaomi 45W power bank Depending on usage it should give me up- 15 extra hours up- 25h in total for long trips. - One more great thing I found on AliExpress is this tiny 65W charger I can put it in my backpack forget about it. Let me know guys have any tips or quetsions! Any good low profile keyboard without numpad?

I am new the Hackintosh community as well as Reddit itself. I recently managed get Mojave running on my X230 but the Wifi card does not work. I know this is a common problem. Is there affordable card anyone can recommend that has both Wifi Bluetooth that would work right out the box? I also know it is possible remove the whitelist which would allow a greater range of WiFi/Bluetooth solutions. Though mostly I am looking simply find a simply WiFi/Bluetooth card that I can just install have it work. Thank all very much.

Hello I have a brand new T480s Type 20L7 I need your help. I haven't found any duplicate posts so please share a link they exist. If there's a better subreddit for these questions please direct me accordingly. I've learned my new laptop has an issue Thunderbolt / USB-C right out of the gate thanks Lenovo . For reference My laptop has Windows 10 installed however it is my intention replace the OS Manjaro KDE Plasma. I am not interested in dual-booting as I have another machine specifically for Windows. I do the following 1. Update the device's BIOS/UEFI. 2. Update the Thunderbolt software. 3. Update the Thunderbolt firmware. 4. Replace Windows Manjaro. I'd like identify the easiest safest way accomplish this. I'm effectively drafting some step-by-step instructions for myself others . Question 1 Should I do this before or after I replace Windows Manjaro why? Question 2 The link above recommends a tool called Lenovo Vantage. Can this tool perform all three steps safely? Question 3 I understand Lenovo Vantage is Windows-only. What are some good alternatives available for Linux? Question 4 How can I validate that I've made these changes successfully? To be clear I think I can probably figure these things out on my own but I'd greatly appreciate any help from the community. This will be my first ever ThinkPad my first time using Manjaro I'm graduating from Ubuntu - I'm very much looking forward using my new T480s. Thanks!

2,gpwfhg,thinkpad,15,2020/05/25 12:09:22,Morning,Is my old T540p worth a tune-up? I have a T540p from 2014 that I used for three years of college. I don’t remember exact specs but it was a 256GB HDD a Core i7 3rd gen? 8GB RAM. I haven’t booted it up lately but probably last August I attempted turn it on. Boot up time is as long as 8-10 minutes before I can sign in. Is this laptop worth the time money upgrade? I did some research found SSD upgrades are popular for making old machines snappier. But given the age of the CPU/RAM is there a justified upgrade for a reasonable price? I was thinking this computer would sit at home be used for hobby electronics work software development I did anything it. Any thoughts?

9,gpn7jk,thinkpad,2,2020/05/25 02:05:51,Night,And now I have TWO X220s. I used work in the field in pretty harsh environments never felt comfortable my work MacBooks. Thus began a succession of cheap subnotebooks none of which lasted very long. In 2015 I decided try out a ThinkPad. I'd always thought of them as lame office machines but after much research including this sub I decided on the X220. I found a cheap one without the IPS screen but NMB switches. It felt solid I threw it in my pack impunity I could type comfortably in the field. Soon after this my work MacBook died but I declined the 500 repair bill upgraded my trusty ThinkPad new memory an mSATA drive threw in a Majestouch keyboard for good measure blue switches of course. One night last month I was enjoying a glass of wine watching The Expanse I grabbed my computer check up on something in the show. Obviously the laptop the wineglass were on the same arc my X220 enjoyed a full glass of Merlot. Not a drop on the table or the carpet. I was fairly composed I immediately held the laptop upside down jammed the power switch for a hard shutdown. I whipped the battery out grabbed some paper towels tried sponge out as much as possible. I left it like this poured myself another glass continued the show. The next morning I took the keyboard out placed the computer in a bag of rice. The keyboard had definitely taken the brunt the board was stained red. I took all the keys off cleaned it thoroughly then left the whole lot dry out for a few days. No good. I plugged in the power cable the charging light flashed then went off. I pressed the power button. Nothing. I was already resigned this outcome but it still felt like a loss. While the trooper was drying out I had already been on eBay looking for a replacement. I had lucked out pretty quickly found an X220t in very good shape. It wasn't the cheapest but I had covered the t version for a while this seemed the perfect excuse. By the time I had finally realized my laptop was truly dead the replacement was bought on its way. What a lovely machine. The screen is beautiful I now understand the IPS love I can play Gentoo a touchscreen the transition was fairly painless. I just popped all the old hardware in the new machine away it went. Gentoo worked fine I just needed a few kernel changes Windows was due a reinstall anyway. I was up running an hour after it arrived. Now my one bugbear was the keyboard. My old laptop was Japanese the new one was US. The new one also had Chicony switches although subtle they did feel a bit more squishy. Despite the burgundy I decided try the old keyboard on the new laptop. Five minutes later I was ready press the power switch. The charging light was on which was a good sign but the power switch declined oblige. Oh well it was worth a try. The X220t has a power switch on the screen for use in tablet mode. I absentmindedly pressed it my laptop turned on. It booted I chose Windows I changed my keyboard layout tested the keys. No problem whatsoever. It even turns off the keyboard power switch it just doesn't turn on again. So of course my next test was the new keyboard the old laptop. And now I have TWO X220s.

1,gpxzjf,thinkpad,3,2020/05/25 13:39:18,Afternoon,Where look for a vintage ThinkPad? Europe  Hey fellow ThinkPad enthousiasts I am the proud owner of both a T420s which I use as a desktop external monitor aswell as a T470 which is currently my daily driver. I really love both of them I'm so fond of them that I might start a little collection. My father used work for IBM for 20 years used a truckload of different laptops but only his last one before he left IBM due the company scaling back in Belgium 4 years ago was still in his posession he gave it me . It's a T430 I'm currently cleaning fixing it. Planning on putting an SSD in it maybe even try out the classic keyboard mod. I would like have an extra ThinkPad project though I was thinking buy a more vintage looking ThinkPad for my little collection. I remember him working on actual IBM laptops I would like one of those or at least from the period that Lenovo's laptops still looked like the old ThinkPads. I would like get one that is in okayish condition which means fully functional passable on the cosmetic front. Things that can be replaced easily are broken aren't a big deal obviously. A second condition would be that it is still serviceable in some way. I don't expect run W10 but putting linux on it or an older windows operating system should be possible. So my questions are - Where do I find a ThinkPad like this? I have tried eBay but that's just one big mess seems be filled scams... - What's a reasonable price pay? I was thinking that I should be able get something for 100 euro or even a bit less. - What models would guys suggest? I was thinking of one of the latest IBM ThinkPads or one of the early Lenovo ones. If have any other suggestions or tips please let me know either in a comment or a personal message. I can use any help I can get!

Lenovo Vantage decided run some updates now my dock doesn't connect anymore. Whenever I plug it in it's not recognized as TB3. USBs Network Audio work as I'm assuming it's being used as a regular USB-C dock. No video output at ALL. Thunderbolt 3 software shows nothing is plugged in. I have this dock at my apartment my office. It does not work at either location. My girlfriend's XPS13 docks just fine works as it has been so I know it's not the dock itself. There are no missing drivers in device manager everything shows as working . I can't seem figure it out. Charging works too. I went ahead wiped the whole drive reinstalled windows. I have all the updated latest firmware BIOS. Same problem. What a waste of time. Does anyone have any ideas or should I just call it in for RMA?

Currently using a dire Chromebook that I bought simply because it was so cheap but recently started a new job that requires video editing it cannot even play the HD video content without glitching let alone edit it it was like 150 I bought it in lockdown as I was isolating away from my computer for 2 months . I also spend a lot of time on my laptop browsing have an awful habit for having like 50 tabs open at a time. My business partner recommended a MacBook but I a cheaper ThinkPad alternative. Few bullet points of stuff I’m looking for - Durable/futureproof hence why I arrived at a ThinkPad use have one back in like 2000 that lasted 6/7 years. - HD video editing - can handle multitasking my terrible tabs habit - has a good webcam I do some tutorials screen can capture - I’m thinking 512 SSD 16GB RAM kinda spec - I like that ThinkPads are business laptops as they’re durable upgradeable but it be nice for media personal use too - decent screen - good warranty so purchase from a good/official vendor - finally I buy NEW have a budget of 1000 Thank so much for reading I look forward any recommendations guys have! Thanks EDIT gone the Lenovo ThinkPad E595 Ryzen 7 16GB RAM 512GB SSD Vega 10 graphics. Direct from Lenovo accident damage cover delivered for 800 quid.

Still happens sometimes. So instead of wasting money on a modern day laptop that I will use maybe 5-10 times a year I decided jazz up my old T400 make it somewhat capable of running modern day software. I have a spare SSD laying around I ordered a T9900 CPU so the only thing left is RAM. But I don't know I should go for a 2x4GB set or 2x8GB set because my T400 may or may not support the latter. I honestly tried googling but absolutely no avail. The official specification as well as the forum threads I found all suggest that 8GB 2x4GB is the limit. Thing is they are all outdated written back in the days when 8GB DDR3 SODIMM sticks didn't exist yet. So naturally only 4GB sticks around just 2 slots 8GB would be a limit back then. But I couldn't google up any info at all as wether the things have changed the release of 8GB sticks. Maybe some of y'all have successfully upgraded your T400 16GB RAM or maybe tried do that failed. In either case please share your knowledge I'd appreciate it a lot.

X1 Yoga 3rd Gen temperatures Hi all I have a ThinkPad X1 Yoga 3rd Gen that heats up when video calling gaming of course gaming but I think there's poor cooling . When gaming in GTA 5 my temperatures are slightly below 90 but they're also in the 90s at times I see 99 C at some points . There is some plastic shielding covering the only intake vent the laptop has. I removed it tried the game again my temperatures were now on average 6 degrees celsius cooler. You can see the plastic shielding right underneath the intake vent here There is a closer look removal of the shielding a few seconds later. My reason for posting is that I wanted ask it would be of any issue leave it without the plastic shielding covering 90% of the intake vent. I'm not sure it would cause any issues air flow since it was covering the intake vent in the first place. Would there be air flow issues higher risk of short circuits or any issues of any kind? What is the purpose of that specific shielding? Thank so much

I am currently looking at the keyboard choices on Lenovo’s web store here in the Nordics they are giving me lots of choices black English UK black German black Swedish/Finnish black Nordic black English EU black Danish. As I do not use a keyboard any language specific adaptations I think my choice would be between the two English variants UK EU. Does anyone know what those two look like? The Lenovo website has me at a loss. I am looking for an ISO keyboard vertical enter key smaller left shift key. The key layout I am currently using on both a MacBook Pro on other devices through a Logitech K380 is what Apple describes as “ABC”. I would describe it as a British UK keyboard the Britishness removed. Image of what my keys map . If both UK EU options follow the ISO physical layout is there a difference in what characters are printed on the keys? If it is just a few characters off from what I am used I see no problem that. I expect be able remap them on the software side match muscle memory on the hardware side there are always sharpies 😉 I’d be thankful for any hints around the UK EU differences!

My P52 started randomly shut off a couple days ago unfortunately a week after my one-year warranty expired . There's no warning before a shut down the only way I can get it boot up again is remove reinsert the battery. I've noticed a bunch of symptoms that may be related. My P52 shuts off 1. A few moments after plugging in the charger even when the battery has 50% charge . 2. When using Lenovo Vantage run a hardware test sometimes it gets all the way through without finding any issues including for the battery . 3. When using the Lenovo Diagnostics Tool check the battery. I charged it over night was able finally full the full test today which found no issues. 4. Even after removing the battery only using the charger. This has been one of the more stable ways for me use my laptop though which lasts more than a couple of hours this way. If this happens I can only reboot the laptop after unplugging reinserting the adapter. I tried a Battery Gauge Reset in Lenovo Vantage which failed gave this error message Failed AC power adapter was detached . I wonder this has something do it as well since the power adapter was plugged in. This seems like a hardware issue me but hopefully I'm wrong. Has anyone experienced something similar? What fix worked for ? Thank . x200B

But somehow some of the keys were kinda weird press not working properly so I got a replacement keyboard. So I installed the new keyboard everything was great - except for the trackpoint which now is not as precise as it used be. The trackpoint is still working but in a weird jiggly way. When I try use it for slowly moving the cursor in a curved way it's pretty choppy it feels like the cursor is only moving in straight lines. If I apply more force / move the cursor more quickly it gets slightly better. But still it's not as precise as it was before. So I checked on the FRUs the replacement keyboard is not the same FRU as the old one. Could that be my mistake? Or is the hardware just faulty? Any way diy my way outta there? x200B Thanks!

11,gpbbh1,thinkpad,13,2020/05/24 11:48:41,Morning,Just got a T440p it's super solid! Looking for advice on upgrades maintenance Just got a T440p after looking for a backup laptop. I was a bit apprehensive because it came out so long ago but after using it it's definitely a great machine. Better than the relatively newer Zenbook I've been using I may make it my main workstation for home use. I got it for about 250 USD it came 16 GB RAM i7-4700MQ I'm pretty sure an IPS display I'm not really sure how tell but the resolution is on par the Zenbook is 1920x1080 . Doesn't have an SSD yet so bootup is slower but the laptop itself is super zippy don't have worry about using too much RAM. Also the keyboard is really nice tactile. My only complaints would be I don't really like the trackpad compared my other laptop the speaker quality also isn't that great. I can use headphones though so this isn't a big deal. Next steps I'm thinking of are install Linux have never used it before but try it maybe install an SSD later. I may need install a new WiFi card as I've been having some issues Internet connection. Are there any other things that would be good do? Also the person I got it from kept it in really awesome condition I'd like keep it this way possible. Do guys have any tips on maintaining laptops for the long term?

The two options I'm looking at are the 6th Generation X1 Carbon the current generation T480s open others as long as they are available on the Canadian Lenovo online store . Both are about 1300 CAD t480s around 40 CAD cheaper. I'm not willing stretch my budget any more than 1400 CAD post-tax. Common knowledge from friends forums lean heavily the X1C but I'm currently slightly leaning T480s because a empty DIMM slot for RAM upgrades on the T480s b Dedicated Ethernet jack without having use an adapter or dock on the T480s c Reported low brightness on the FHD version of the X1C b Reported trackpad issues on the X1C For reference raw specs of the models I'm looking at are identical at i5 8250U 14 1080p 8GB RAM 256 GB SSD Is there anything about that specific X1 Carbon that makes it a better proposition? I'm aware the wQHD version of the X1C has a stunning screen but that model is not available on the online store.

3,gpg5ad,thinkpad,35,2020/05/24 16:37:50,Afternoon,X1 Extreme Gen 2 very high temps I was using Bandicut cut a video although the program is pretty taxing on the CPU i7-9750H GPU GTX 1650 max-q the CPU temperatures got extremely high. Most concerning was the 102C CPU package cores temperature shown in the second screenshot is there a reason for the discrepancy of temps between the first second screenshots? . I posted a few days ago about a sudden decrease in my X1E2's benchmark performance. I'm wondering that issue the high temperatures shown below are due dried thermal paste. Also I've made sure my fan assembly is clean. Something possibly note is that even before the sudden performance drop I experienced the CPU would get 98C or maybe even 99C under max load. However I've never seen anything above 100 before. However would this feasibly explain the suddenness of the performance drop? I would expect a drying of paste have a gradual performance impact. In addition I have only had this laptop for around 6 months is this a reasonable amount of time for the stock paste run dry though keep in mind I have run a lot of benchmarks etc. ? One last thing even under high load my GPU never gets above 70C its performance is lower than what would be expected of it. Is it throttling too early so are there any solutions? x200B x200B

Any advice on these questions would be much appreciated any advice more broadly on which machine is better would be great. They both seem so similar me. Thanks!

I know this is new because I used have 40 chrome tabs open several youtube videos playing without an issue. I have an i5 cpu have never previously noticed fan noise outside of very intensive applications. I suspect the issue is due cooling.

My current plan is open up the laptop clean it up try reapply thermal paste. So my questions are 1. Are there any good resources for me follow clean the machine reapply thermal paste? 2. Should I be concerned about anything from non-hardware angle? Is it possible a recent software update is causing the issue? TIA!

It's decently equipped an i5-5300U 20GB of RAM a 500GB Samsung 850 EVO. This notebook is my everything machine. I have a dock at the office 3 28 displays a USB dock at home a couple 28 displays in conjunction the built in another USB dock setup in my portable office trailer it travels me 24/7. I use a lot of browser based app's for work so lots of tabs open constantly. I also work basic 2d CAD drawings PDF editing some large KMLs in Google Earth. Lately the ol T450s just seems be slowing down. I notice the CPU up at 100% quite a lot. RAM HDD seem handle the load just fine though. Is the upgrade a T490 an i7 either 8th or 10th gen going be a noticeable upgrade? I have been looking at them more more lately. I would likely go 16GB 8/8 the 512GB NNMe drive. Just a decent chunk of change drop as I would for sure need a new dock at the office a couple extra power adapters for my other work spaces. I would love stick the s model but I also need a built in NIC. I'm not sure the dongle will do it for me as I also use it quite a bit out in the field configuring equipment what not. I assume they still come Intel NICs? I need something capable of VLAN trunking. I use a handful of VLANs on my network having virtual adapters setup IPs ready go just makes things simple.
2,gp8kt3,thinkpad,5,2020/05/24 09:13:27,Morning,Anyone who switched from Dell XPS 13 ThinkPads? Hello I am currently using Dell XPS 13 9350 2015 . I am thinking of renewing my laptop especially because I have more battery life. I mostly do programming a lot of Youtube/Twitch watching. Naturally the first laptop I looked at is the new Dell XPS 13 9300. On paper from reviews it looks perfect. I love the 16 10 screen ratio new Ice Lake CPUs Thunderbolt 3 on both sides great built quality its dimensions smooth glass touchpad its SSD is still upgradable... But reviews don't reflect the long term experience there are quiet a few people on internet who complain about issues they are having their new XPS 13s. In fact there are so many that I am afraid that I will pay near 2000 will get a defective device. The closest alternative seems like ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It is not as perfect as XPS 13 on paper but the imperfections are not deal brakers for me. And I don't see as many people complaining about issues they are having X1 Carbon which leads me think that the quality control is a bit better compared Dell. Out of all the imperfections the thing that most bothers me is that there is no Ice Lake or AMD 4000 option. From the reviews so far it looks like Ice Lake provides significant power efficiency compared 14nm CPUs. Although the advantage of getting 14nm CPU might be that it is pretty stable at this point in case I install Linux for example.

I just wanted make a quick post for those who might be considering a Thinkpad that the usb-c power supply has known issues which require a replacement of the motherboard. The issues seems happen a lot of users right after the warranty is up. Lenovo hasn’t been too helpful on the situation other than offering fix it at my expense. However there is no guarantee that the next one won’t short out in a year again. I am not trying knock down Lenovo this post as I was happy my previous purchases from them. So this violates any rules please remove mods. I just make sure people are aware that these issues are there.

7,gp0qmj,thinkpad,3,2020/05/23 23:19:57,Evening,P53 4K LCD upgrade some other improvements Hello fellow thinkpad users. I bought my P53 a 1080p 300nits display thinking that I would upgrade the display 4k much cheaper If I buy it myself. There are a few compatible options for P53 but I went NE156QUM-N66 just because 4k model comes this exact model. Unfortunately 1080p 4k displays don't use same eDP cable as 1080p one uses. So I bought the required cable DC02C00FW10 for the 4k display. FYI this cable does not work OLED. It requires a different cable. I also bought this adapter for 2.5 HDD. My 9.5mm 2.5 HDD fit snugly in it. It all cost me around 90 including superbuy shipping fees. When I purchased the laptop Lenovo was charging around 200 for the same display. And I keep the original 1080p display. I've been waiting for the new display it recently arrived. I made the replacement it all went well. Screen has gorgeous colours it is very bright. After 300nits 1080p display it made a huge difference. If try another display I would suggest watch out for connector pin pitch display outline size connector location because eDP cable has just enough length for current display. Upon request I made a video explaining how disassemble the P53. You can watch here. Power Consumption While changing the display I made a power consumption comparison between my old new setup. My total system power consumption was 2.99W on idle minimum brightness no X server running. No did not read that wrong. You can achieve this using TLP on Linux According my measurements old display was using 3W for the backlight. New display is consuming 7.14W at full brightness. Keep in mind that new display is 500nits versus 300nits But also 4k display itself consumes an extra 1.3W. 1080p Total System Power Consumption 4k Total System Power Consumption -- -- -- -- -- min brightness 2.99W min brightness 4.31W max brightness 6.06W max brightness 11.45W In conclusion your workflow benefits from using a 4k display NE156QUM-N66 is definitely a winner. But conserve your battery might wanna look for a 1080p display. Thermal Paste I also was having problems thermals. Whenever I used anything CPU intensive P53 was throttling immediately. CPU temperature were jumping 97 C in 5-10 seconds. So I bought MasterGel Maker Nano 11W/mK thermal paste. It really doesn't matter which thermal paste buy as long as it is a decent one. This was on sale so I went it. After applying the new paste my thermals are now OK. CPU temperatures rise slowly as it should have been. I suspect old thermal paste was not making a good contact. I made a comparison using s-tui a cpu stress test tool for Linux . Here are the results CPU package was throttling down 38W but now CPU uses full 45W TDP it stays at 92 C. RAM And lastly I upgraded the memory from 16GB 32GB dual channel. Also might look out for memory power consumption because each DRAM consumes 0.62W. So a dual channel setup will consume around 1.3Watts 4 slots are all populated will be seeing a 2.6W just for memory power consumption.

The only time it turns on is after its plugged in for a few minutes. This problem also exists I remove the battery try turning it on plugged into the charger. The battery seemed be on its last legs as the laptop turns itself off at around 50% remaining charge. Tried a few things after googling - remove battery hold power button for 30 secs re-seat the RAM modules etc but no dice. What could be the problem?

I've noticed some anomalies that are a little annoying I was curious find out the issues were common ThinkPad computers because I've never owned one before. Upon starting up for the first time I immediately noticed the issue of missing keystrokes. Thankfully Lenovo released an upgraded BIOS which completely solved the problem. I have 2 issues pertaining the TrackPoint. Issue One The TrackPoint seems very inconsistent regards the amount of pressure required in order move the curser. I've attempted adjust the settings via the Control Panel no avail. Sometimes the curser will move quickly over my second monitor not a lot of pressure other times the curser is stiff doesn't move easily in order say scroll down a web page. Issue Two Occasionally after using the TrackPoint scroll down a program or webpage the curser will continue move for 1 - 2 seconds on its own. It doesn't move far or quickly it almost seems like it is recalibrating itself. Are these two issues normal when using ThinkPads? Neither issue bothers me enough warrant calling the support line I am just interested as anybody else experienced this issue when using the TrackPoint. I appreciate your replies.

I've been thinking of getting myself a Thinkpad for some time now most likely would be getting one in no longer than 5-6 months from now. I had an opportunity work on a Thinkpad a bit immediately fell in love it. I am currently using a Lenovo Legion Y520 laptop as I was much more into gaming when I got it compared now. While I've really been enjoying my laptop for over two years now the two main complaints I have about it are the weak battery lasting only about 45-60 minutes while doing some light work like writing looking at reference material dull display the colors are all faded compared the screen I plug into it . I'd like a machine that could last at least 4 hours on battery without me looking for an outlet. I do a bit of everything. Right now I mainly get a programming job but I also do some writing occasionally some basic photo audio video editing using GIMP Inkscape Cakewalk by BandLab Da Vinci Resolve respectively . I was thinking of upgrading the Thinkpad I get some parts from my current laptop I have 2x DDR4 2400 MHz 8 GB RAM 120 GB M.2 SSD a 250 GB SATA III SSD.

I'm trying decide between a X1 yoga gen 3 the regular c930 yoga. This may be a loaded question considering where I'm asking it but are the thinkpads that much better? What do like so much more about them? Keyboards? Otherwise the specs are largely the same for the 2 that I'm looking at. The thinkpad is just slightly more way more not on sale I can't seem figure out why though...

I have tried selecting the option of booting from Windows Boot Manager the NVMe. It keep on bringing me back the Boot Manager. Things I have tried. - Disabling Secure Boot - Disable Kernel DMA Protection - Change UEFI boot mode Both option Legacy The Windows update completed without any force reboot or power off. I don't think it is a hardware issue as the loop issue on occurs after Windows update restart the ThinkPad after update has completed. Any T490 user out here is having the same issue?

Will it work I use a cable like that a HDD or SSD ? I see two problems here this cable there will be no powering of the HDD/SDD is that right? Do I need a second cable then? the shape is ---- whereas it should be on the HDD side. So how do use this? Or would another cable such as this one ?

2,gotujk,thinkpad,1,2020/05/23 15:01:24,Afternoon,X240 13.3 mod - What is required is there a recommended screen? Interested in doing the 13.3 mod on my X240. I don't care too much about the extra screen size but since I upgrade FHD at some point anyways it makes sense investigate the possibility. Two birds one stone. Anyways I know the BIOS whitelist will need be disabled. And of course the bezel screen mounting will need be altered. My questions boil down the following - Is there anything electronic that has be altered? I'm not new electronics work but since I don't have any of the parts yet I can't compare side-by-side see what is necessary. I'd be surprised this is a plug-in swap. - Is there a recommended screen go ? I'm looking for wide color gamut high brightness possible but one of those new low-power screens would be good since battery life is a concern. - Has anyone done this while retaining the webcam lid sensor WWAN antennas? I don't really use any of those except the lid sensor but I don't like the idea of de-featuring the laptop it's avoidable. - Has anyone made the bezel cuts so cleanly they look stock? I have lots of experience a Dremel but over a long straight cut it never looks perfect in my experience. Sanding it smooth after might not help either since plastic can look funny sometimes when sanded. Thanks 
3,gora74,thinkpad,12,2020/05/23 12:35:45,Morning,Has your ThinkPad been reliable? I'm trying figure out my experience is an anomaly. I've had a variety of laptops over the years a lot of them are still running. This is my second Lenovo but my first ThinkPad. When I got it it had an intermittent TouchPad issue. After exhausting everything software related I found that the ribbon for the pad was not clipped in. No big deal. After 7 months of ownership I started having intermittent power issues that lasted for 3 weeks then the motherboard died. Got it serviced by a local authorized service center solved the issue. I go run the Lenovo Diagnostics Windows get a battery health error stating that it's functioning below capacity. Tried everything but the battery was dying relatively quickly the error was persistent. Sent it into Lenovo service center in Texas got it back it's the same issue.

5,gokxa3,thinkpad,1,2020/05/23 07:01:05,Morning,Frost or Screen Door Effect on B140HAN01.3? Removal of the Antiglare Film is Easy. First time poster in this forum. I wanted write a post confirming the simplicity of removing the antiglare film of a B140HAN01.3 lcd panel. There have been complaints about the panel having a 'frosted' or 'screen door' appearence. Depending on one's level of OCD this can be annoying enough make a person purchase another panel. Such was my case. I upgraded a T430S a LCD converter a panel purchased on Ebay pulled from a Dell Latitude E7470 or E5470. Although the upgrade was a substantial improvement over the stock panel it had some scratches on the antiglare screen the frosty effect was distracting. After searching the net I realized the postings regarding removal were confusing. Some posters implied cannot remove the panel while others described removing it on what appeared in the post possibly be a touchscreen. Because I only had 35 in the panel I was willing risk an attempt. So in the interest of clarity for anyone searching for this topic I confirm that it is easy remove the coating that the improvement is dramatic. The panel is crystal clear although now it naturally reflects glare. I am pleased the results. Here is how do it Remove the panel from the computer. Lay wet paper towels over it. I put it on top of a dry cloth keep water from getting under it. Wait about an hour a half keep the paper towels wet. Scrape a corner up something sharp I used a paring knife . Peel it off. The coating is a plastic sheet comes right off. It really is a simple as that. A similar improvement in my opinion can be had from peeling off the textured tape on the trackpad. Makes it feel smoother more Macbookish. Of course as always this is one person's personal experience YMMV.

1,gota1u,thinkpad,2,2020/05/23 14:28:03,Afternoon,New me T480 a couple of questions I recently bought a T480 i5-8350u processor 32gb RAM 512GB NVME SSD 18 months still on the warranty for 609 I've been thinking about upgrading from my T530 for a little while this seemed like a pretty good deal. So far I'm loving the laptop but there are a couple of questions that I have before I really start setting things up the way I wanted. 1 I read about the issues the Thunderbolt controller. The Thunderbolt driver was 1.41.645.0 which looks like is the version of the driver that solves the problem but the firmware was only... 14 I think. I upgraded it 20 on the day I received it. Is there anything else I need do? Or anything I should be looking out for? I don't have any thunderbolt components so I'm not sure there's a way test for the issue. 2 Are there any other known issues this laptop that I should be keeping an eye out for? 3 I'm planning on getting an SN520 512gb drive so that I can dual boot Windows Linux Linux will be my primary OS . It's got a WWAN card already installed but I don't see myself ever using it. Am I right that it's as simple as pulling the WWAN card out putting the SN520 in? From what I can tell booting off of the SN520 shouldn't be an issue right? 4 The only issues Linux that I can see are the fingerprint reader. I'm a bit bummed about that I liked the fingerprint reader on my T530 but I decided before I bought that it wouldn't be a problem. Everything else seemed work when I booted from a Live USB. Are there any other Linux gotchas that I should know about? 5 Just curious do think this was a decent deal? Thanks!
1,got7ca,thinkpad,2,2020/05/23 14:23:51,Afternoon,I have no clue anymore... So I bought an X230T a couple years back. It's been an awesome machine tanking all of the abuse it's received not showing any signs of it. The one issue I did have was the battery stopped charging randomly. I had always got the not genuine Lenovo battery pop-up but it never actually carried weight. The battery always charged fine anyways. However the charging brick got tucked under a blanket one night while I was playing a game it overheated. Warped the case pretty bad melted the solder off the 3 pin connection for main power into the brick. I wasn't able borrow an iron solder the pins back in place for about a week. But I was able bend the pins get connection it ran the laptop fine. However during that time the battery would NOT charge at all... Now that the brick is all fixed up though it charges just like new. I'm really curious anyone here knows about the circuitry in these things generally speaking has an idea about that. Was it maybe too little voltage or too high amps charge the battery it was just barely managing power the PC alone? Thanks in advance.

2,gonokk,thinkpad,3,2020/05/23 09:28:15,Morning,Question about L series Thinkpad How does the L series Thinkpad compare the T the E. My friend has a T430u is looking upgrade soon. I have a E570 while not being as robust as her T430u it is plenty sturdy for me I like it quite a bit. I've heard the L series is somewhere in between the E T in terms of build quality features. Is that true? Looking at the upcoming Ryzen releases I was leaning towards the L14 over the T14 or E14 simply bc of DIMM slots. T14 Intel all soldered is a shame E14 Intel only has 1 DIMM single channel RAM...RIP . L14 Intel seems be the only 14 left 2 DIMM slots. Even among the 15 the L15 is the only one of the three that has 2 DIMM slots the T15 E15 each only have one . I personally don't like the soldered RAM direction Lenovo is taking but it is what it is. So the only option left is the L series. My question is simply I recommend the L14 my friend will she notice the lesser build quality coming from a T430u?

Not sure where start. I’m going off college for engineering in the fall hopefully so i’d be using it for CAD CAM SW/F360 simulation some lower-powered games. Budget is fairly flexible but i something beefy preferably 15.6” ish display fit my bag. Weight thickness aren’t something i’m too worried about. Let me know what think! Many thanks T.

Now it seems like it's back out of the blue. I've no idea it's software or hardware related I imagine the latter though. So yeah I've got this kinda like crack looking line on my screen but can ONLY see it or it's effect rather when scrolling . I.e. can't just look at the screen tell there's a crack. I tried take a video can see when the text scrolls past the line diagonal from top left like the middle it like warps it. Any thoughts as what might be causing this? Maybe a loose connector or something for the screen? I've not dropped it or anything that I can think of. Also sometimes it seems cause a small flickering of the screen. Sometimes I can tell other times it's bareeeeeeely perceptible but it's still there. Thanks! Here's the video. Edit It's an X1 6th Gen 2k screen that matters.

I've had probably 4-5 Thinkpads IBM Lenovo but have been out of the loop for a while because I've been getting free Dells from work. I found an x270 that I think hits all the marks for 600 on Amazon. Looking for feedback that is a deal breaker. Needs Small footprint. I travel for business go back forth from the office home during covid. I prefer small laptops for that reason. 80% of the time it will be hooked up a monitor. Legacy ports I work in IT have go data centers fairly often. So ethernet ports other legacy ports are pretty important. No need for SD cards or VGA. Would like a single USB-C port for charging bricks/phone. Specs I need i5 or higher 16gb of ram 256-512 SSD does not need be nvme . Prefer 512 SSD because I need dual boot a basic Linux distro. Screen Don't care - not playing any media on this. Persona preference is matte also small. 13.3 max smaller Battery will be plugged in most of the time not too concerned would still prefer 2-3 hour battery life make things easier. Docking would prefer a bottom dock will entertain USB C docks. Just need dock when I'm in the office. This refurbished beefed up thinkpad seems hit all the marks. Am I not thinking anything that is a deal breaker? No gaming media editing or streaming will happen on this device. Strictly using network utilities RDP network scans etc. Is the x270 the best fit or am I missing something or a better model? Thanks!

2,goabhm,thinkpad,11,2020/05/22 17:56:27,Afternoon,Thinking of a ThinkPad P53 or P73 have some questions These seem offer the best value for large gamut 4k screens. I have a few questions that I thought some of the experts here might be able answer 1 Is the P73 enormous? I have a 15 work laptop Precision 5510 that I consider just a bit smaller than ideal. 2 For the P53 is there a clear winner between 4k IPS 4k oled? I have an OLED TV really like the picture but would be terrified of burn in. 3 I will mainly run photoshop lightroom. There's a small chance I may need run SolidWorks or do some machine learning but it will mostly be teaching myself those things. Is there a clear choice for graphic card in this situation? I think budget wise I could probably stretch the RTX3000 but that's wasted I can always save that money. I don't do games but might like use it for non-gaming VR. 4 Is it crazy get these models for personal use? Should I be looking at something else? I honestly can't find a comparably priced gaming-model a 4k large gamut screen. 5 Is now a bad time buy for some reason? I don't follow the laptop market so closely my last computer died somewhat suddenly . Thanks!

After buying it I found it throttled hard when trying do anything GPU load for more then 15-20 minutes. So I found this guide in a post on this sub Reddit I'd comment this there but its archived. I followed nopethefuckouts steps I didn't end up doing anything for overclocking or undervolting the CPU I just installed afterburner adjusted the curve of the MX150 his suggested amount. I found those settings I still had the problem of it throttling often even after changing the in game resolution 1366x768. So I thought I'd try something different. or practically all my computers I use them in the Maximum performance power profile in windows. What I have tried it has so far worked great is I clicked on my battery icon on my tray changed the slider for best performance better performance or even best battery life. Changing that has caused my laptop no longer throttle I've even been able up the graphics a bit from 1366x768 in Overwatch 1920x1080. I also found that turning on Vsync makes a big difference in the stability in frame rate in Overwatch.

3,go2d9l,thinkpad,2,2020/05/22 10:32:38,Morning,Looking for a new laptop could use some guidance Hi! I'm very fortunate have gotten a hookup from a friend who works at Lenovo for a 76% discount replace my beat-up ASUS am a bit overwhelmed by all the options. I've never had any bells whistles on my previous laptops but I am about go back school use this opportunity get something that will actually last. All I know for sure is that I a Thinkpad for its durability a great keyboard 12-16 GB RAM. I made a spreadsheet comparing 19 different models which hasn't really helped narrow things down. I multitask a lot on my computer lots of browser tabs different programs open at once but am not a gamer nor am I typically running huge tasks. I'm hard of hearing so a strong sound system is important just in terms of volume complexity of sound is less important . I'm looking for under 3000 for the web price. With the discount the most expensive one I'm looking at would be 690 which is still quite a bit more than I usually spend on a new laptop. I quite like having the touchscreen on my current laptop but I can go without it. I'd prefer something on the lighter more portable side but again not a dealbreaker. I have a 1 TB external drive so internal storage isn't hugely important me. So some questions I've never had a laptop over 250 nits so I'm not sure how drastic the difference between 250 300 400 500 is. I do know 250 is far too dim when I have work in sunny spots but would 300 be enough or should I aim higher? What should I look for in an Intel processor? I don't really understand the difference between the generations or i5 vs i7. Is 8 MB cache that much better than 6 MB? Is it better have two sticks of 8 GB RAM one 16 GB stick or does it even matter? I'd very much appreciate any recommendations both for specs specific models. Thanks!

I am however having zero luck getting Dolby Vision actually work on it. I’ve googled like mad try fixing it but end up a dead end every time. Specific error when I use the Win 10 Netflix app or Edge on Netflix for example I’m greeted a black screen that says “Dolby Vision playback is not authorized on this computer. Please uninstall Dolby Vision remove this message” the video never shows audio plays though . I’m updated on everything have ensured my display drivers are updated using the standard Lenovo .icc profile have downloaded installed the WQHL drivers or whatever Netflix's FAQ recommends. Every thread I've found has no final solution people just ghost stop posting. So does anyone have Dolby Vision working on their X1 Carbon 6th generation w/the Dolby Vision 500-nit panel?

I don't like the Apple notebooks because they cost too much for what they offer in particular because they are not made last. And I say that while writing from a Macbook Pro 2019 i9 processor that I've return within a month. So since I like thinker things I would like enjoy thinkpad family but I would like start a cost effective machine just develop some apps until I can afford a real macbook really need one. I at least a 4/8 cpu but I don't know which thinkpads other than t440p support such cpus. I don't really mind a thick notebook but carrying an heavy machine while commuting on bike it's not super-nice. A good scalability of performance is something I would appreciate in particular use the notebook at the university without staying close a plug. I know that I many things for little moneys I would say 600€ budget but I grab the best option for my needs. Thank guys this is a really nice community.

I suspect this wasn’t the best deal out there I’ll be checking the site see the price drops over the next 30 days. My last laptop purchase was a T430 in 2012 so it’s been a while. I didn’t have as much time do research so I’ve got a few questions remaining. 1. I saw that they released this Thinkbook line. It had better specs all around except battery life for a cheaper price! It took me a while decide but I ended up going the Thinkpad because that’s what I’m familiar . Does anyone have an opinion of Thinkbook 15 vs. Thinkpad T580? Based on my research it seems like Thinkpads are just built last longer. Hope I didn’t make a mistake. 2. Based on my specs what are the low hanging fruit upgrades I can make the T580? I am contemplating a RAM upgrade 16gb - is that worth it? I heard battery life is also not good. Should I be buying a larger battery? 3. Does anyone know what model RAM is included in the T580? Im wondering I can just buy another single 8gb RAM or I will have buy 2x 8GB RAM. It seems like the 2x 8gb DDR4 2400 will run me about 70. 4. For the RAM upgrade I also saw that DDR4-2666 is compatible. If so should I be getting DDR4-2666? I’m not savvy on the specs. If anyone has recommendations on which RAM I should get for the T580 please let me know.

2,gnvmgq,thinkpad,2,2020/05/22 04:04:34,Night,Yet another person going uni asking for buying advice Hey folks I am sure that I am able find good advice in this subreddit on what ThinkPad I should get. I hope for detailed responses advice at that A bit of a backstory I'm currently a high school student that will graduate this summer. I plan study geography later this year hence I plan a lot considering tech stationeries so that I'll be well-prepared for studying. Related the 'tech-thing' I would like buy a new laptop I do favour ThinkPads. I already own a T440p it suits most of my needs but unfortunately not all of them. Overall I really appreciate how upgradable it is. I switched in an IPS FHD-display a new trackpad a new keyboard. However it is not as portable as it was before. While I switched my TrackPad I did broke the connector cable which first caused weird bugs for instance my mouse just froze sometimes. When I attempted fix it it stopped working at all. I bought several replacement cables trackpads but either the cable did not fit or it just gave me error codes. I suppose the mainboard is bricked some extent. But I will not attempt repair it I think it is not worse the money any more. Likewise the performance is also disappointing sometimes. I do not game a lot but I cannot miss Minecraft or indie games such as Celeste or Terraria. But even these games rarely reach framerates above 40fps in low medium settings. Maybe my OS Pop! OS is blame I don't know. But despite the fact I do work will have when I will study geography specific software such as QGIS which needs a fair amount of computing power. One might say I could just buy a T480 or something similar but I have some concerns relating the ThinkPad line which is why I don't know my next laptop should really be a ThinkPad . The problems the Thunderbolt chipset but also the upgrade-ability that can't change the battery on some models that have buy a separate very expensive USB-C dock a new generation of ThinkPads coming this June all this made me insecure. For those who TL DR Thusly I will give a broad overview on what I need. If have a specific model would recommend or even a specific point of time regarding the new ThinkPads coming soon just tell it. If recommend a good laptop outside the ThinkPad line this is also completely fine . Please be aware that I would like buy a used laptop for mainly ecological reasons. Should be portable that excludes the W-series IPS display preferably Full HD It should utilise the 'good' TrackPad Exchangeable battery is a big must It should handle light ! gaming e. g. games like Minecraft or Terraria software such as QGIS Darktable Blender a certain extent Upgradable at least switching RAM SSDs would be cool optional not affected by these Thunderbolt issues I can't really check on platforms on eBay users applied the patch already or the given laptop is still patchable optional Dockabikity would be cool but this is optional there are good USB-C docks I would consider it as well. I would pay around 600 700 Euros. Thanks in advance sorry for my really specific demands halting English!

50,gn9hnh,thinkpad,36,2020/05/21 03:14:34,Night,Lenovo QC is definitely not what it used be. The new P53 arrived yesterday. Was kinda excited until I opened up install my 128 GB of RAM 970 EVO PRO drives. Now I’m kinda bummed. It looks like a pre-built system that they had lying around had a trainee open her up remove ram. I ordered it only 8GB RAM because I have my own DDR4 32GB modules. The system probably comes more than just 8GB pre-installed so they likely had remove some. I’m kind of glad I did that or it would have been quite a while before I discovered what they did. One of the first things I noticed was slight evidence of fingerprints on the LCD cover. Ehhhh not a dealbreaker but definitely not like an “oh wow this machine has never been touched by bare human hands before” kinda feeling should get when opening your PC for the first time. Next I went install my RAM discovered one of the screws securing the bottom access is not only missing the captive plastic washer so the screw falls out when flip the cover upside down but it is also stripped out inside the chassis. We are already off a pretty bad start. The first thing I noticed after opening the base cover was cosmetic. One of the plastic DIMM slot dust covers was crushed up like some amateur Simon Mall techie was in a big hurry remove a RAM module shoved their big fingers in there crushed the cover up. I know cosmetics but it’s pointing towards a serious lack of attention detail. I suspect the system was pre-installed 4x8 32GB of RAM they had remove 3 modules ship the system out. No big deal but kind of points towards a system sitting on the shelf as opposed a built--order system. Next I noticed that there was no RAM installed in the main DIMM slot nearest the battery where single RAM modules are supposed be installed. That means the single 8GB module that shipped the system must be under the keyboard therefore in the wrong DIMM slot. Concerning but not a huge deal considering I was swapping it out anyway. Edit while I understand this may be common practice for Lenovo it makes no sense install a single RAM module under the keyboard which ultimately forces remove the keyboard no matter which RAM upgrade options go for in the future. It is also contrary the HMM instructions. I went ahead popped open the keyboard which is way easier do than the HMM makes it seem. I’m also pretty ticked that officially need a special tool remove reinstall the keyboard. That’s kinda fucked up Lenovo. Not gonna lie that’s a dick move. Under there I found that both DIMM dust covers were installed crooked off-center. Not only that but the lower one was installed way too far back which jammed the cover up under the chassis made removing the RAM module unnecessarily difficult. I had use a special tool just pull that cover up without damaging it. I ended up removing both of these covers reseated them in their correct placement. Then I went install my RAM under the keyboard that’s where the trouble started. The RAM in the top DIMM slot would not lock into place. The latch is damaged does not snap into the RAM module like it should. Check out these pics see what I’m talking about. I tried the new ram old Ram the OEM Lenovo RAM. All did the same thing meaning something is funky that entire DIMM slot. Tbh I could have lived some of the other issues. The stripped out screw was a mess I probably would have had send the system back for the chassis issue but that DIMM slot issue is just not going work for me. Going be shipping this system back let Lenovo know how I feel about this. I don’t mind the 5-8 week lead time it means I get a system built order not something that’s been sitting on the shelf they have do some funky modifications it before shipping. That’s gonna be a hard pass. New update I went the i9 RTX 4000 combo because I got both for a steal. As it turns out this is a totally pointless configuration. The system idles at 60-65 sitting flat on the table. Under load both CPU GPU throttle moderately 85-90% capacity while running at 85 for GPU 95 for CPU. Not impressed performance either for such a heavy build. I might repaste undervolt out of curiosity but not looking too keen on keeping this particular config.

3,gnjdsv,thinkpad,11,2020/05/21 12:37:50,Morning,Shinobi Initial Impressions Nice but Not Quite Right for me  My Shinobi came today order 15XX for those still waiting . It’s my first mechanical keyboard for context. It feels very solid pretty heavy. Build quality is high. Aesthetically it really does it for me. I like the feel of the keys though I honestly prefer the ones on my T25 the tactile bump is a lot more defined than the one on the MX Browns I’m a fan of the shorter travel. I will probably put o-rings on the Shinobi switches help that. The clit mouse feels quite a bit lighter more responsive than others I’ve used. It’ll be an adjustment but I already like it a lot. I don’t love the TrackPoint buttons but also don’t find them be bothersome. My only gripe - though it’s a big one - is some of the dimensions between the keys. The keys themselves seem be longer along the y axis e.g. Fn--Esc axis than the standard 7-row ThinkPad keys. Critically from the middle of the home row ASDF keys the near edge of the top surface on row 6 the distance is 53mm on the Shinobi vs 49mm on my T25 X220. That messes some important muscle memory for me especially hitting the Delete End PgDn keys. On a standard ThinkPad keyboard I can hit them by pivoting - but not lifting - the base of my palm. Not so on the Shinobi. I’m also inadvertently hitting the arrow keys my palm when I move my hand hit keys in the Delete cluster because the arrow keys are lower down on the keyboard come out prouder above the palm rest than those on a ThinkPad. Hitting the Y key using Ctrl combinations is also more challenging because of the sculpted keycaps longer travel. I’m making more typos than usual. I’ll probably be able adjust somewhat but I suspect my hand size will limit how well i can adapt. I know they put a lot of effort into designing every aspect of this keyboard that the F row has custom keycaps so I’m not sure why they didn’t get this right. If they made the diagonal lower wall of those 6th- 7th-row keys more vertical bring the top surface closer my hands /or made the gap between the 5th 6th row narrower it would probably be fine. A higher palm rest relative the keys might help as well. The reach issues are exacerbated by the additional travel of the mechanical switches. Adding o-rings or putting some thick neoprene on the palm rest might help. But I have say I’m a bit disappointed as I was hoping work this keyboard muscle memory developed on the standard one. I’m loving the TrackPoint on the Shinobi but honestly think I’d be happier overall an SK-8855. Unfortunately those are getting rare are approaching the price of the Shinobi these days. I respect TEX a lot for having made this am glad live in a world where the Shinobi exists. I just wish it worked better for me.
2,gnmbpq,thinkpad,1,2020/05/21 16:12:08,Afternoon,Soooo... Maybe my Thunderbolt port does work? Or no? I've been fooling around the Thunderbolt port on my T480 for weeks. Initially Lenovo thought I probably needed a logic board not the best option . I've downloaded installed new drivefirmware BIOS settings removed Thunderbolt from the machine totally redownloaded Thunderbolt / driver firmware. Etc. etc... My problem is that I've had a monitor plugged in via the Thunderbolt port for about a year it has been working great. Then all of a sudden it stopped working. Today I tried plug my Pixel 3A phone in a usb c usb c cable I can transfer files just fine. When I plug in the display I'm using an adapter that goes from HDMI USB C. So my question now is could it be possible that the little adapter has just failed? Do they fail? Will that port still work as a usb c port Thunderbolt has failed? I DO see my display jump from my built-in display the big one for a second when I plug in the cable but then the big one goes black again it jumps back my built-in display. Any help avoiding a new logic board would be greatly appreciated!

1,gnod37,thinkpad,2,2020/05/21 18:19:49,Afternoon,Add bottom cover air vents above fan? X1 Yoga 3rd Gen Heating I have an X1 Yoga 3rd Gen an i7 8650u the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics along 16 GB of RAM. I play some games on my laptop like Grand Theft Auto 5 Dark Souls 3 Rocket League etc. When I'm gaming the laptop heats up of course but it heats up 99 C often it stays in the 90s. I'm also using TPFanControl the fan is set fan64 above 90 C which is around 8000 RPM for me higher than the BIOS setting at those temperatures . I'm thinking that the air vents underneath the laptop are not good enough for cooling I've been thinking of adding more but I haven't decided yet. I also reach consistent 80s when I'm on Skype or Zoom using the laptop at the same time work or watch a movie so I don't really think it's a gaming issue. This is a post an image of an X1 Carbon's vents but it looks exactly the same on the X1 Yoga 3rd Gen the fan in the same location I was thinking of adding vents above the fan like that user but in a more clean manner of course like this user The temps were already present before I started using TPFanControl. That's the reason I started using it because the temps were pretty high the fan wasn't spinning fast enough in my opinion. Have any X1 Yoga 3rd Gen users done this? Any other ThinkPad user? What are your thoughs? I'm looking for some input before deciding I should. Thank . Edit I changed the thermal paste a while back it's still the same.

Was tired of the constant 2-3 year lifespan we get out of the standard “on sale” 400- 500 laptops read a handful of reviews figured that even the cheapest Lenovo a Ryzen 7 would be better than the Walmart special or whatever they’re peddling at Costco. Obviously price was still a factor so scoring the “best” processor on an E series for 700 seemed like a good idea at the time. Then I find this place everyone is saying the E series isn’t as good. Is it still better than the Asus/HP laptops I’ve been buying? The whole point was getting something built slightly better than those so it would hold up longer. It’s still in the mail will be here tomorrow. My wife isn’t going be doing any heavy processing but I may use it for photos at some point. Already planning upgrade the RAM 32gb from the standard 16. Also a 256gb SSD is nice but I’ll probably plop one of the WD 1TB drives I have sitting around into it. Thanks!

The current left Fn Ctrl placement on the keyboard is such a major point of grief for so many users potential users. It is unbelievable how there isn't yet an option for the keyboard be configured the more common Ctrl Fn placement on the customisation page. Before all the diehards of the current configuration dismiss this concern take a look at the writings on the wall. The ThinkBooks the latest ThinkPad X1 Fold all have the Ctrl key at the bottom left corner. Eventually Lenovo will have make the default ThinkPad keyboard align the industry. And when that time comes will regret not supporting the idea of a coexisting alternative keyboard configuration.

I had buy a laptop for school I'm studying sound design I opted for a E595 since it was the only model a high end processor ryzen 7 3700U 16 gbs of ram at this pricetag I paid around 700 euros for my beauty . Fact is I love it for everyday use but there is something that keeps me from using it for its real purpose. Performance. I use a variety of programs which require ram cpu most of my classmates which are composers song writers use up 64 gbs of ram but I have a problem cpu usage in some of the programs I use. I had do 2 things kind of boost performance first of all cpu usage from the power option. I don't know why there's no high performance option on this laptop but only battery savers. I had do one myself. And then my cpu clock was way behind the 2.3ghz base clock sitting at 1.70 even when my computer was under stress tests. I had deactivate an option from the bios get it working at 2.30/2.50 under stress but still I get high usage in some programs even when I'm in idle. I read something online about Ryzen requiring different attention working ram speeds other factors. Is there anything I can do push this laptop the performace I was hoping get out from it? For reference my old desktop ddr3 8gbs 1600mhz an I7 4770k not overclocked always managed use the same exact program ableton live 10 under 10% of cpu usage various tracks 15/20 tracks . On my E595 i get 10% of cpu usage one single track. I hope I can solve this finally use this thinkpad his maximum potential. Sorry for the long post

Compared my w530 I had the gpu overclocked the fans turned down tpfancontrol it was perfectly fine. The w541 is both undervolted underclocked yet any moderate load it gets uncomfortable warm. The gpu isn't hot for a gpu at less than 75 Celsius but the palmwrest is burning hot for a human. I don't understand how people use the w541 without an external monitor. Furthermore after doing a lot of research before picking up the w541 I only heard this as a minor issue/afterthought.This is a fundamental design flaw for a laptop that is supposed be pushed. So for all those thinking of picking a w540/41 either get the w530 or p50 this gen is shit. If anyone has any advice please feel free lmk.

So I recently bought my first USB-C hub HyperDrive 9-in-1 for use my ThinkPad X1 Carbon I’ve been having a couple of issues. 1. Everytime I connect the hub Windows shows an error saying “DisplayPort might not be supported” no monitor connected yet occasionally “Device is not being charged” as well. Ran into a BSOD once as well. Does this mean the hub is faulty? The charger is 65W the hub can technically provide 60W so shouldn’t be an issue no? Also tried iPad Pro as well no issues whatsoever. 2. A pair of speakers are used but at same levels volume is lower when the aux is through hub than through laptop directly. And sometime static bursts are heard in between. Works perfectly when connected via aux though. Fault of hub or speakers 10 years old speakers fyi ? 3. When power aux are connected but hub is not connected laptop there’s a horrible whine not static through the speakers. Why could this be so? 4. Laptop temperatures are running much higher than normal when charging through hub than direct all 4 cores have hit 100 Celsius peak average 85 minimum 67 load under 20% Apologies for the long list but it’s my first hub I so wanna embrace the one cable setup but these problems are present I’d rather stick multiple cables than risk damaging my laptop it’s a work system as well Thanks cheers!

I will run Linux on it probably bring a small wireless mouse me. It doesn't have have ethernet. Being able replace ANY parts including broken screen or keys is important I prefer buy used parts. I think battery power may be a big deal so being able replace the battery easily availability in buying it changing it in the middle of the day may be important. I do not play games but i do lots of browsing use LibreOffice a lot. I am assuming that a laptop is like a PC- that it has an SSD capability that it can hold any size GB on it. Not sure power supply is affected by GB size of SSD. I think I only need 125 GBs anyway....or even less. Oh I 'd like edit videos using Shotcut possible - but it isn't a must. If I left out anything that I should be considering let me know. I may be using this as a second or third screen at home. I am not seeing the flair option when editing -sorry bot

I am trying decide between the Thinkpad p43s core i7 16 gb ram 512 GB SSD the Nvidia Quadro graphics verus the 2019 Dell XPS 15 same storage newer i7 a Nvidia gtx 1650 graphics. My main question is who would the Thinkpad be the same price as the Dell when all my sources day that the performance of the Dell blows Lenovo out of the water? They are currently the same price discounts I wanted ask this group because maybe I'm missing something that Thinkpad offers. I also plan use this as a workstation some form of dock connect two he monitors.

So please hear me out. I don't switch the functions of the keys entirely I would just like some added functionality of my Fn key. Currently Fn C does nothing is there a way make this copy? Same Fn X Fn V Fn S etc. Basically I would like my Fn key behave as a Ctrl key for all Fn ... combinations that currently do nothing. Fn combinations that do something like Fn F8 should remain the same. How do I do this?

I tried it two times first step charges successfully 100% in both causes the second step discharges around 5% takes around 5 hours but then the calibration stops the message is Incomplete. AC power adapter was detached. then the laptop starts charging again. I don't know it makes any difference but I have the laptop running in peformance profile while doing the test just make it faster. first time I thought that the adapter was not plugged in correctly but after the second time I'm worried that it might be related the adapter itself or the laptop. Did anybody face a similar issue when using vintage calibration tool?

I immediately dumped it off the side mopped as much up as I could paper towels then let it dry open keyboard-down overnight. Everything works fine other than keys sticking a bit but I have a couple questions... --Exactly how waterproof is the keyboard?

I'm reasonably handy researched how swap M.2/RAM but it seems like getting the keyboard might be a bunch more work...??

Got mine recently i5-10210U 16Gb Ram 512SSD FHD non-touch . Installed Ubuntu 20.04 a miracle happened everything just works out of the box. Sound speakers mic fingerprint all functional keys everything. Thermals are great the fan just stays silent. I don't do heavy compute on it though browser terminal code media . Not sure about exact battery life estimated time keeps jumping. Subjectively around 2h of work browser typing ate around 20%. Will post here /when I get more firm numbers. I installed tlp though. I owned 1st gen of x1 when it came out in 2012 it was crap this one came such a long way. Generally among dozens of laptops I had including all sorts of macs other thinkpad models dell xps 13 hp spectre etc - nothing comes close in this category. I think I found my perfect laptop could not be happier. Any questions about 20.04 on this machine - pls ask.

Hey all I just tried replace my X240's clunkpad this trackpad Install went okay except none of the guides mentioned that the stupid connector on these had a black clasp/clamp so for awhile I was just shoving it out/in trying get it seated. Anyway I have it properly seated/clamped now it's not showing up in Ubuntu or when I booted a Windows 10 install from USB. Not seeing it in /proc/bus/input/devices so the kernel doesn't even see the hardware. Also the trackpoint isn't working on the keyboard anymore. The keyboard still works fine though. Any ideas? Did I screw up the new connector or ribbon cable by not properly using the black clasp unclamp/clamp the cable? The cable feels pretty resilient.. but I'm worried I cut a pin or maybe damaged something during removal. Photo of the cable how it's currently seated x200B Edit Just tried plugging back in my old clunkpad... also not working. Uh oh. I think I may have either damaged the cable/motherboard or accidentally removed a cable. See the rear connection on the rear of the clunkpad that came up when I removed it from the palmrest assembly I'm starting think this palmrest assembly is only compatible the clunkpad's wiring setup. I have the non-backlit keyboard. - based on that photo of the x240's original wiring. x200B

This is my 4th ThinkPad but my first one bought new so naturally I'm buzzing. I'm retiring an X121e a faithful i3 2nd gen servant of 2011 vintage where one of the hinges is giving up. First thing I did on the X395 was wipe Windows install Ubuntu 20.04. I ran Mint on my old X121e. I knew I only wanted Linux on my X395 but I'd read that Ryzen support isn't the best older Kernels so I just wanted something that worked. So far it seems work just fine. Would be great swap notes other X395 owners especially those running Ubuntu. Also mine didn't come an ethernet adaptor in the box. I'd seen reviews where it did so maybe I assumed it would come one but it didn't. It's no biggie as I don't need it right now but would be good hear others experiences.

I just joined haven't seen any questions regarding problems this isn't the right place for such a question could please direct me a proper subreddit? Also sorry for littering this one. A friend asked me diagnose his Thinkpad Edge E550 it does not boot the red dot above the i blinks three times quickly upon connecting a charger it should be normal as far as I know however after the power button is pressed the dot begins blink slowly like as the PC went into sleep mode. Also as the dot blinks faint clicking quiet motor whine can be heard as the laptop is having a hard time spinning up it's HDD. I tried removing the battery for about two minutes while holding the power button discharge it but no avail. I also checked it under my own power supply Lenovo Essentials G510 as my friend is using a chinese replacement yet still it won't boot up. Is the hard drive dead? Edit after unplugging the CMOS battery for about five minutes it seems partially boot the red light stays solid fans spin but there is no image on the screen the system does not load I tried listen for the hard drive spinning up but it's either very quiet or doesn't spin up at all.

I only use Windows really other than the display the main reason I love my ThinkPad is the keyboard. I only paid 150 for the X270 think it's great BUT I always have a little wonder whether there would be a thinner lighter sleeker machine that I could use as an alternative. I'm always a little jealous of people lovely thin laptops but I don't their keyboards. Ridiculous I know but I thought I would ask the people who know these things. Feel free tell me shut up enjoy the lovely machine I have btw.

Hi Recently I wanted buy myself my first laptop decided that thinkpads would be best because from what I have read heard these were the best laptops. I've been thinking about T480 because of usb-c charging dual battery high performance it's been recommended in this video I also thought about P50 for high performance but battery seems really small for it's size in my country Poland there aren't any at a reasonable price around 800 . I can spend up 725 I can buy only from Europe because delivery would be too expensive. I'm planning use Linux. Thanks in advance TL DR I best thinkpad for up 725 good performance battery life linux support. My English is not the best I'm sorry I made any mistakes.

2,gmu0qt,thinkpad,10,2020/05/20 10:17:46,Morning,Is key damage covered under warranty? Typing this kinda pissed from my P52s. Previously the up arrow key developed a flaw where it were pressed from a corner as opposed the center it would pop off. Pressing it back would snap it back in place until inevitably hit the corner again. This problem kept getting worse until finally any keypress from center or side would result in the key coming out it became increasingly difficult snap it back in. At this point I went my university's campus shop which happens also be a Lenovo service provider. The guy over there straight up pulled an up arrow key from a donor keyboard put it in mine told me come back there were any more issues. Fine by me as long as it worked. Now the same issue has started crop up in the right arrow key. I hit it from the corner my pinky it just pops right off. It pops right back on again but no doubt this will get worse just like the up arrow did. Is this kinda damage covered under warranty or does it count as regular wear tear ? I'd ideally like the entire keyboard replaced cause there's no telling what key gives way next. I didn't use it in any excessive/extreme way my knowledge. Side note I'm super unhappy this keyboard. It feels good type on but on top of this key pop off issue the backlight of the keys bleeds all over the Enter key stabilization is getting worse use really quickly. I thought ThinkPads were built last but so far it seems that my roommate's 2018 MacBook Pro the problematic keyboard is doing better than my machine.

When it does external screen might have some weird colors like it lights up is all purple or light blue sometimes weird lines as it is broken. However when I wake it up by touching the keyboard or a mouse it goes back Windows login screen all is normal. Any suggestions on how prevent it from waking up the laptop?

When I run multi-threaded benchmarks instead of staying at 3.9-4.0 GHz my CPU drops 3.4-3.5 GHz although the temperature is the same as before. Other CPU-related tests like 3DMark also showed a significantly lower score. All the power settings related are the same. I even did a system restore before a recent Windows update. It might just be me but it also seems like my computer is running hotter overall. I made sure the fan assembly was clean. If anyone also experienced this random drop in performance or know how fix it or even run it performance isn't impacted let me know.

So I finally decided try the classic KB mod for my x230 bought a broken x220 which turned out work fine after putting in some spare memory HDD. Plucked out the KB proceeded do insulate the pinouts. Unfortunately grubby fingers as I am it seems I bent one or more of the flaps too much now they don't firmly connect. Trying it back on the x220 columns for 4RFV 5TGB 9OL. the entire right column backspace enter RShift occasionally the spacebar touchpad buttons were not working. Fiddling around i noticed that I held the two metal flaps together a grip the buttons reliably work. I tought I might have used a rather thick tape but removing it wiping away the glue did not change the situation. This suggests that the flaps themselves are too permanently bent. I wanted know anyone has faced this problem before how they solve it. Thought it's better ask for help before I inevitably strip the screws further mess up. TIA for any inputs.

6,gml071,thinkpad,9,2020/05/20 01:02:50,Night,Got a ThinkPad W541 for a few months now. Had a Macbook Pro before this. And a ThinkPad T580 before that. Are all modern laptops shit now? Let's go over some laptops I've used. T530 Before the T580 I had a T530. No nonsense. Quite fast heavy sturdy. Didn't throttle. Accepted all mods I threw into it. SSD's? Sure. New RAM? Sure. HDD in caddy? Sure. New WiFi chip? Sure. New keyboard? Affirmative. T580 The T530 was a great device. But it was getting slow for more intensive apps. So I went the T580. Nice but sometimes it wouldn't boot an NVMe error. When flexed the right side of the device when picked up the laptop basically it would BSOD. It would throttle after 30 seconds of playing intensive games the heating just couldn't keep up. Had undervolt it do other tweaks because benchmarks showed it was not doing much better than T580's the 8250u I had 8550u thanks shit cooling. Wasn't the most solid laptop either I did come from a T530... Sold it because I didn't feel like it was a 'ThinkPad-worthy' device in comparison my T530. MacBook Pro Amazing solid aluminum build. Amazingly smooth operating system. Fantastic audio insanely good display. Very smooth experience just great. But the performance wasn't great especially not for the money. Gaming performance was horrific. Could't even relax properly after a long day of working. Well okay no gaming then. I can still use it for my video prod-- oh no when I plug in my external HDD there is interference. I could literally not use external monitors or HDD's because the USB C combo the aluminum shell caused interference which killed my internet. Rare problem but I am not alone others have this too online. I miss upgradeability know ports . W541 Welcome back ThinkPad! Bought this because I don't keep switching. Threw my desktop out I finally have something branded as a mobile workstation desktop replacement . Sounds great. Hmm there is a bit of flex in the build but whatever. Then I found out that sometimes because of course only sometimes the internal HDD caddy doesn't get seen I have reboot it often twice before it sees it again. Oh when install it into the Ultra Dock there's a horrible coil whine. Oh play games newer than 2005 then it will throttle the GPU heavily after approx 30 sec of playing will get 10FPS. Want replace the WiFi chip? Can't! Because it's whitelisted! Oh no spilled water over the spill-proof keyboard? Even though it was just a couple of drops we have d-d-d-d-drainage hooolesss now half your keyboard won't work! Oh man time blow the fan really loudly in idle! Question Are all modern laptops incompetent? Aren't there any true workstation ThinkPads that DON'T throttle? I don't need a thin laptop I need a FUNCTIONING laptop!

My two previous laptops have been a Thinkpad P50 loved the laptop the off-center keyboard got me after a while though. a dell studio XPS 16 from back when I was a student. All 3 laptops have been 1200. had at the time of purchase had decent specs I have used 1 HP laptop several macbooks at work over the last 10-12 years. Currently use a MBP 16 at work. I'm really excited see the new Dell XPS 15. The reason I bought the P1 apart from the great specs for a good price were the option upgrade. upgrade RAM SSD over time . The port selection is excellent the keyboard is a dream type on compared most other available keyboards the laptop is for my purposes light enough. What I don't like about Lenovo laptops are the mediocre displays they put on most of them. I'm also not as much a fan of 16 9 as I am of 16 10. My P1 currently has a FullHD display which I chose for longer battery life. I also don't think I need 4K in a 15 screen - I'm not pixel peeping while consuming entertainment on it. However I would like a color accurate display. The lower end P X series fall flat on this. The new XPS can be had starting 1299 seems have user upgrade-able SSD RAM. Dell also seems price their customization's more reasonably than Lenovo does. X1 Extreme starts at 1549 currently 9th gen processor. although dedicated graphics card. I put two configurations side by side. They cost roughly the same but I think the Dell XPS15 might edge out the X1 Extreme ever so slightly. Thoughts ?

I investigated further that the thunderbolt logo on the system tray keep appearing disappearing as the sound triggers. When opening the app it will either show on the attached device chains as blank or port 1. x200B Any ideas on how fix this?

Is the SSD RAM soldered onto the Thinkpad X1 Yoga Gen 4? I have been looking at this laptop as an upgrade from my X220 but Lenovo charges almost 4 times as high as the market rate for both RAM SSD. My X220 from 2011 has a 1TB SSD 16 GB of ram. However getting the same on an X1 Yoga Gen 4 lands me north of 2000. Adding in the 4G moden which my X220 has the price goes even further. Are these new Thinkpads still as reliable as the old? Could a fully specced X1 Yoga Gen 4 last me 9-10 years just as my X220 has? If not I'll upgrade the X220 1080p HD stick it. EDIT Upon further thought it seems sticking an X220 doing upgrades hacks might be the way go until someone releases a laptop that can compare in terms of expandability build quality. There's such a big second hard market for old Thinkpads spare parts that an X220 could probably last another 5-10 years.

6,gmcg9k,thinkpad,7,2020/05/19 15:03:41,Afternoon,Maybe buying my first ThinkPad but could do some advice please! Hi all I'm in the market for a 2nd hand laptop I'm wondering which ThinkPad might be best for me. I'm looking spend around 300-400 but obviously less is better! I'm looking for something which might be a reasonable comparison my experiences a Dell XPS13 9360. Long story short I had one an i7-7500u 16GB 1TB NVMe 3200x1800 from my previous job but had give it back when I was made redundant I'm missing it terribly trying make do an HP 2530p Core2Duo is just hell! I know I won't get a direct comparison the XPS13 at this price range unless I'm mistaken which will of course be a huge bonus! but I never no doubt I can get better than that HP! My primary usage will be ECU tuning logging in my cars but also some home use for web browsing a little light development work the likes of VScode or Arduino IDE carry around the house when I'm playing my home automation stuff. Something that can sit next the sofa that I can just pick up turn on will be ready go in a few 20-30 seconds I never put a laptop into standby I always shut it down when finished - I had an old 17 behemoth of a laptop wake itself up from sleep a few years back overheat itself in my bag . My primary wishlist items are something that's lightweight enough hold in one hand when picking up from the passenger seat not while driving I assure ! has a high resolution screen that I can see in bright light good battery life but some CPU power available I need it at least 8gb memory. The XPS would mostly last a full weekend at the drag strip powered up not in standby logging from the ECU most of the time the screen off granted plus a little reviewing of logs tweaking in the fire up lane between runs. The higher screen resolution was good as it meant I could fit more data onto the screen at any one time plus even multitask when developing despite the small screen size. I'd initially been eyeing up the X270 as it seemed have a reasonably modern CPU for the better power consumption as the screen has bigger bezels than the XPS13 the 12.5 screen an option of a FHD IPS screen seemed a reasonable compromise as I've not seen a higher resolution screen thus far in my searching certainly not in my price range... Plus my wife has an X270 as her work machine so I've been able carry it around a bit get an idea for how it sits in the hand on my lap the weight... I didn't actually realise this is what she had until after I'd done some of my own research! However this thought was scuppered slightly when looking around this sub today seeing a few posts seemingly criticising anything newer than the X240… I also briefly considered the 3 range for the 13.3 screen but then the bezels started get a bit bigger than I'd ideally been looking for but I could be persuaded... I don't think I step up a 14 or bigger screen. I don't need a huge amount of CPU power I have a reasonable desktop triple monitors for more intensive stuff but it reasonably snappy during my day day use. So any advice comments or information greatly appreciated!

I've used Linux for years on a few older ThinkPads before on my desktop as well usually Mint but I'm pretty comfortable in anything Debian- or Ubuntu-like . So when work offered hook me up a brand new ThinkPad I was rather excited get a Linux setup going on brand-new hardware. On the other hand though this is the first time in a long while that I've had worry about a Linux install being able support new hardware the last time was on a desktop PC. This new ThinkPad came loaded-out just about everything 10th gen i7 Nvidia GPU 1440p screen almost every other option available for the model. So I need know what it's going take be able squeeze some decent battery life out of the laptop. I see battery life on the T490 is rated for up 16.11 hours but that's on Windows I'm sure it's overly optimistic. But I can get even 60% of that I can still have an all-day laptop that's my goal. So I'm hoping someone out there has already taken on this challenege figured out the best way approach it. Also I have Thunderbolt docks use it in desktop mode when I'm at home or work so I'm hoping that's either not an issue in Linux or someone has any tips share it is. x200B Thanks for the help!

As of an hour ago...this is the third time in less than 6 months of being new from factory my T490 won’t come back from a system update. Each time it has done something strange where it wouldn’t restart until some odd series of events happened. First time was a BIOS update but the last two times were some kind of standard firmware update. First time it sat for almost 10 days while Lenovo’s horrible next day site service faltered only for it magically boot up after being unplugged for a week. Second time it wouldn’t go past a black screen wouldn’t hard reboot no access battery take out only for me finally press the docking station power presto. For the last hour it has been stuck in the boot screen that says “hit enter cancel normal startup”. I use this laptop for business I can’t keep going on like this. Any recommendations? Like I said I’ve had horrible experience the extended warranty I purchased.

As far as I can tell it's kind of a piece of junk. The keyboard was not great – it quickly developed an obnoxious squeaking grinding noise apparently this is common it beeped at me all the time. The trackpoint nipple was drifting also common every time it began drifting it would disable the trackpad. The monitor is freaking awful! It's so dim the colors are so flat it's practically grayscale the ghosting is insanely bad. Not worth the 1500 I spent on it. Pretty unacceptable quality for such a high price. I managed get a refund after the seller tried screw me out of 500. For anyone considering buying a Thinkpad...... don't.

I'm really hoping that someone in this community can help me. I recently bought a Lenovo Thinkpad T61 the notorious Nvidia GPU failure issue. The unit was in mint condition but will need a replacement motherboard become functional. My issue is that for some reason don't ask me why but somehow in the life of this laptop someone removed ALL the stickers from the bottom of the laptop. And when i mean all i mean all. No model or s/n be had anywhere. There is one number stamped into the case which was 7663 which denotes that it's a 14.1 widescreen model but that's it. Is there anywhere else on the computer that the full model number i.e. 7663-CTO is stamped as well as the s/n?? I can't log onto Lenovo's support site have them detect my hardware since the unit is non-functional. There is NO stickers under the removable battery i haven't taken the unit apart yet see it's stamped on the ram cover. Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

A while back I got my x220t for a steal at 50 something I will brag about until I'm in my grave. It's been great so far has been a huge upgrade over my previous HP stream. My main goal is upgrade it into a decent / semi-decent video editing PC. At the top of the list is replacing the motherboard an x230t i7-3520m. Below that is setting up an external GPU which I also have questions about. I've done LOTS of research as this is my first build ever but there doesn't seem be a lot of information floating around about a board swap like this compared the non-tablet models. Apparently the LCD cables don't match? I'm not sure. Is there a guide for this somewhere? And do guys know all the differences between the x220t x230t that I should look out for? Also on a side note for the GPU I am aware of the express card adapters that connect it the computer but I just can't wrap my head around what graphics card buy. There's so many options configurations too much for my pea-sized monkey brain understand. What would guys recommend for what I'm trying do? I really appreciate your help will include in my will when I die.

I recently learned that all Ivy-Bridge/Haswell Intel iGPUs have been basically nerfed their performance have been reduced by up 50% that made me kinda regret ordering a T440P since it has an Haswell based architecture that means that it would be barely usable for my what I should do it. I'd like know your experience as Haswell Thinkpad owners this mitigation thing How it affected your usage video-editing/gaming activities... there is a way disable it/increase performance. Thanks in advance anyone who will help me by answering my question!

I need get a new laptop would like get a windows laptop as I prefer the OS I have a windows desktop also so I'm not a fully mac person . I've been trying get a X1C7/X1C8 virtually the exact same darn model! but the display options are abysmal. -The 1080 FHD has bad ghosting issues on multiple replacements I tried display replacement then device replacement . Many people have mentioned this issue on the forums so it is a major problem low-powered displays in general. -The WQHD is only 300 nits seems have a kinda dullness it i've seen reports of a dull yellowness here it as well as being fairly hopeless in brightly lit natural lighting conditions . The X1C6 WQHD-HDR was beautiful 500 nits - but it was glossy as all hell. -The 4K model colour contrast also looks impecible but its glossiness looks awful most people on reddit report nearly half the battery life compared 1080 FHD. Plus some lagginess MS applications etc have been reported on forums. -Moving from 16 9 16 10 or 3 2 aspect ratio is also a no-brainer but not a dealbreaker I suppose. They were even strongly considering it as early as 2018 but still no changes. Just the same shitty displays for reasons above . I love so much about the X1C the keyboard the ports the slim lightness make it the best laptop on market in my mind. But it is 2020 we should not have displays that look like they were made in 2010 on high-end laptops. Will X1C9 rumoured be released 2020 Q4 be a fix all these display issues? That rumour in the link indicates there will be a few different forms of X1C so most likely will require different displays . Hopefully that means an improvement. Hopefully the X1C9 will be new displays? Somehow I think theyre going stick these crumby ghosting low-powered displays because their only relevent corporate clients are probably less concerned about it. Is it worth holding out for or do I just bootcamp a 2020 macbook pro? Cos my current macbook has lasted so nicely over the years MBP displays are fantastic less gloss very good battery life. Albeit no ports URGH keyboard is average compared X1C.

I am in the market right now replace the T530 had settled on the X1 Extreme. I have offered donate my T530 a family member who has just lost their job so they can use it look for jobs. I was just ready press the buy button on the X1E until I realised there is a new Dell XPS 15 out. Comparing the two I can only see one reason get the X1E the keyboard. Apart from the Thinkpad keyboard which admittedly I do prefer a lot the new XPS 15 seems beat the X1E in most ways. It has a newer CPU 10750H vs 9750H faster GPU 1650 Ti MQ vs 1650 MQ better battery life 97wh vs 80wh onsite rather than RTB warranty I have used Dell warranty for my monitor it's fantastic . There is also one other absolute killer reason buy it 16 10 aspect ratio on the XPS rather than 16 9 on the X1E 1920x1200 vs 1920x1080 for FHD . Apart from the looks I prefer the Thinkpad the keyboard far better I simply can't see a reason any more get the X1E. Am I missing something? I really the X1E but my head tells me get the XPS. I guess the only reason might be I can get a better price on the X1E somehow. x200B

Many things can be upgraded easily as i saw on the many YouTube reviews as i am currently looking for a cheap laptop this seemed like a no brainer. This is where your help would be much appreciated right as we speak i am looking at two Thinkpads one is an X220 4GB ram i5 a 320GB HDD the other is an X230 4GB ram i5 320GB the X220 is around 150 while the X230 is around 155 Being sold by the same seller as it seems I know my current circumstances that i will stay one of those laptops for a long time my use cases are not too demanding. Seeming as both of them have that dedicated slot where can insert an Egpu is as future proof as it is going get for me. So yeah 155 is pretty much my entire budget this will be the first laptop i would be purchasing my money so any advice is much appreciated.

Hey VSauce Michael here. Long time lurker first time poster. Just got my hands on a can't-tell-it's-been-used T480 at a decent price.

My main concern is upgrading memory storage not necessarily maxing it out because I'm trying be good keep within my budget... let's cap it at let's say 440 in upgrades for now for then I'll have a perfect 1000 workhorse by the end of it. Plus I know how much the Thinkpad community loves their T440ps. Also can probably tell that I'm a complete tech-novice. This'll be my first time ever upgrading anything really I'm looking forward it!

Our cat somehow managed jump up onto where the laptop was located landed on the top half of the keyboard . Instantly the screen display appeared very odd distorted very similar 'internal glass crack' symptoms in this link . x200B I ordered a new screen off of eBay swapped the displays. While the new display worked fine it was only visible when I shone an external light source on it ie. phone light . After googling the issue it turns out that I'm an idiot forgot disable the internal battery inside the BIOS... I have since done so swapped out the new replacement screen for the old screen see the backlight is broken for both. There was no display at all on the old screen could not even see the distortions that appeared before the swap . Plugging the laptop into an external monitor via VGA cable works fine I boot into windows just fine operate the laptop normally. I thought about trying another screen but I believe the issue is the backlight fuse or a slight possibility of the LCD cable - do think this is the case? Would suggest I try another replacement screen first or just send the laptop out have the fuse repaired bearing in mind the replacement screen was 40 fuse repair costs when the laptop was only bought for 200 . Thank !

I figured it's probably out of charge tried charging it - LED near the charging port won't turn on either. Poked the reset button - still no effect Is it braindead or am I missing something? UPD Just as I hoped the cause of death was the battery. I tried powering it on from my ol' Nokia 6822's BL-5C battery which has compatible voltage - the keyboard seems be functioning just fine the keyboard is visible in bluetooth devices charging seems work too although I couldn't test the keys due how disassembled the keyboard is atm. I'll go pick up a replacement battery that'd actually fit inside of this keyboard tomorrow.

Only reason I say 1st gen is because current gen is super expensive - too much for my 1200 budget. For background I'm an incoming computer science freshman. I don't think the CS curriculum will be too resource-intensive so my need for performance mainly stems from my hobbies. I play some modded Minecraft think FTB Revelation do some Photoshop work use audio editing/mastering software like Audacity future plans use software like FL Studio or RX 7 . I'm sure all three machines are overkill but needless say I like future-proof. So here are the main differences I've noticed P52 ThiccPad so there's more room for cooling but I'm concerned about the weight from toting it all over campus Definitely a workstation Quadro GPU Removable battery P1 Much more thin but I'm concerned about cooling Workstation Quadro Not easily removable battery X1E Also thin therefore a cooling concern here as well Closer a gaming ThinkPad than a workstation GTX 1050 Not easily removable battery I'm also concerned about the battery life on all three options but I suppose I can't have my cake eat it too - I've got make some compromises on battery life the performance I'm seeking. What's everyone's thoughts? Appreciate taking the time!

2,glln6r,thinkpad,13,2020/05/18 11:29:39,Morning,Convert T480s motherboard into desktop Good day everyone So during the stay-at-home season a little mishap occured my cat pushed a big plant down from a shelf onto my T480s. Yay for that. Result is that the screen is shattered ripped of including the hinges. Keyboard touchpad are toasted do not respond/trackpad cracked the top shelf case has several deep dents. So basically a goner. However the core machine is fine. When hooked up via USB-C it performed several stress tests including Prime95 just fine. Since the machine has a nice i5-8250U I am really hesitant just throw the machine into the garbage just yet. So I thought of converting it into a desktop. My father needs a replacement for his aging i5-2400 I think this barebone would be a nice path do just that. He is just doing browsing microsoft Office anyway so this would work really well. However I was wondering about two things Is it possible connect a different fan the header on the motherboard or does the system go nuts when it detects something other than factory default? I just believe that a more powerful desktop-class cooler would be better suited given the additional space would allow for a more quiet operation. And secondly My idea basically is turn this into an all-in-one machine for my dad. He has a nice enough 27 1440p IPS Panel a vesa mount I like the idea of attaching this machine the back of it. Has someone maybe already done this are there build logs find somewhere? I am just curious find out what issues might occur down the road before I get started pump money time into it. Like i.e. is the motherboard happy booting without a keyboard touchpad attached? Are there know issues look out for?

It showed the usual The battery has failed due normal wear. The battery can not be charged.Replace the battery . After reading posts here some other information I decided replace the battery for a new one. Once I installed the new battery the second it reached the 100% the same issue showed battery fails due normal wear... Now I am concern that it may be something wrong the laptop itself or even the charger as I have replaced it a year ago for an original one the same V A specifications but a higher Wh the company from where I bought it said that V A are the same a higher Wh should not be an issue . Original charger 20V - 3.25A 45Wh Replacement charger 20V - 3.25A 65Wh What would be your guess here? Is it a coincidence the new battery came faulty is there something wring the laptop? Is it possible that the charger has ruined both batteries so hos is possible that the first one lasted for a year the new one failed after a single charge? New battery same failure

So a few days ago I made this post asking about a T460 but it was sold out before I could figure out it was worth it. Today I took a look they're back in stock as luck would have it I found another T460 for a similar price. One thing I noticed was a lot of people recommended getting something full 1080p instead of the 1366x768. The second I'll call it the 'new' one avoid confusion T460 has 1080P but it's only running windows 7 pro the warranty is 180 days compared the 18 month warranty the original had. I took a look at my current laptops specs found I'm only using around 90GB of hard drive space right now so a 180SSD sounds like it should be enough. My main concern is whether windows 7 pro is any good compared windows 10 pro my current laptop is running. I found can buy windows 10 online for pretty cheap I did a quick google shopping search found windows 10 pro license key for anywhere from 5 20 the license key gets the actual operating system right? I found a windows 10 pro DVD-rom for 40 maybe I could find it cheaper I shop around . I put a table some of the specs that are different between the two below hopefully that helps. x200B x200B Model T460.I5.8.180SSD.PRO T460.I5.8.500.PRO - - - Price 346.99 335.99 RAM/Type 8GB/DDR4 8GB/Not Specified SSD size 180GB 256GB USB x3 USB 3.0 Not specified Webcam yes no HDMI Mini-HDMI output Not specified Screen Type LED widescreen LCD Screen Resolution 1920 x 1080 Full HD 1366 x 768 HD Operating system Windows 7 Pro Windows 10 pro Warranty 180 days 18 months TL DR I'm trying decide between the two Thinkpad T460 laptops noted above. I'm wondering having the HDMI output full HD LED display is worth the lower SSD size the older operating system that I might upgrade I go the 180GB the shorter warranty. I'm having a helluva time trying decide any help is appreciated. hopefully I can get this figured out while they're both still in stock!

Is it the cable or is it the system board?

It is a good lightweight machine which have a lot of ports especially full size sd card reader ethernet . But the screen seems very bad especially PWM. I do not buy t480s QHD screen because price battery life. So is it possible change the display for example the one that is in the t490? IGZO low power seems very interesting.

I was wondering I could just download the newest 64 bit bios from the support page install it overriding the current most up date 32 bit uefi? Has anyone done this? I don’t do this end up bricking the device in case this is not possible. Also this works will I have do a clean install right away or will my current win 10 32bit install still work after the uefi upgrade?

1,glh7wf,thinkpad,2,2020/05/18 07:25:01,Morning,My new me T470 a couple of questions regarding screen replacement RAM upgrade. Hi thinkpad. I share my new me T470. I bought it as an upgrade my X1C that I also bought 2nd hand 2 years ago. The new me T470 My X1C I bought the T470 for what I thought was a good deal 320USD for where I live in SEA . I had a good experience when I bought X1C the seller was very informative wrote a detailed product description. This time I bought from a different seller who was less informative. I was also more careless. So I found out late that this is the lower spec version. I was aware of the lower spec processor 6300U but I didn't expect was that the screen was only 768p it seems be of lower quality than the one in my much older X1C1 it bleeds on the lower right corner. I really thought that I'd finally get a screen upgrade lol. The other thing is that the keyboard is not backlit. But overall compared the upgrades that I get I think this laptop is still very worth it The processor is still a big upgrade from the 3427U. RAM upgrade-ability. Double the SSD size also upgradeable I . HDMI Ethernet port! I love this. I can now charge my laptop using USB-C! I already own a Baseus 65W GaN charger so I can now bring only one charger me charge everything my phone my laptop my tablet my headphone etc . Using a dongle I can even use 3 monitors at once this is a first for me haha. I also have two questions that hopefully thinkpad can help me 1. I searched for a replacement screen spare-part. I found one that is 1080p but the seller warned me that I replace the screen a higher res screen than factory spec there's a chance that I wont be able change the brightness. Is this true? I'm a little worried about upgrading the screen now. 2. I'm also planning upgrade my RAM. The one installed is 8GB DDR4 2133MHz but I read that T470 is supposed support DDR4 2400MHz. If I upgrade is it ok use DDR4 2400MHz? Or should I stick DDR4 2133Mhz? Thank so much in advance for the help.

I wanted get your thoughts on the screen however. I'm considering the WQHD vs the FHD non-touch due the resolution but I'm wondering the 300 vs 400 nits is really that big of a difference any take on this? I don' the 4k because I heard that they are prone flicker. Full disclosure I'm embedded in the apple eco-system I'm coming from a mbpro but I don't mind switching Windows. Like many before me many after I made the terrible mistake of sinking a lot of money into a late 2016 mbpro 15 model that god awful keyboard the no-esc key. So I've been thinking of sticking Apple because the new 13/14 mbpro's will supposedly significantly improved their keyboards BUT the reason for considering a Windows laptop in the first place is primarily due Windows the recent amazing changes surrounding WSL 2.0. Also I use a VM a lot on my mac it runs seamlessly do any of have the same experience when running it under Windows?

1,glg5zq,thinkpad,9,2020/05/18 06:20:41,Night,T420 - What would upgrade? 
0,glfv5u,thinkpad,2,2020/05/18 06:01:06,Night,Consultation on getting new Thinkpad your thoughts/experience/insight are greatly appreciated. I have been using a T520 since early 2012 it has served me well. I have upgraded the RAM 16 gb have a SSD in the original drive bay an HDD in the ultrabay 1 TB each . It still works for most basic tasks but is starting get very choppy when I edit the occasional video or do graphically intensive tasks. It also overheats when I try watch 1440p video. It has lasted 8 years was used a year by a family member before given me . I am looking upgrade a Thinkpad that will hopefully last another 9 years. I have always wished the graphics were better in the current laptop therefore I get one a dedicated graphics card I also appreciate the modular nature of this laptop how I have been able increase RAM drive space as my use case has required. I therefore do not soldered RAM. I also a laptop that is futureproof in the sense that it is overpowered now but will not be so in 5 years. I love the fact that my T520 is still going strong. With these conditions in mind I have been drawn the P series laptops as they have multiple drive bays 4 slots for RAM without any Soldering. I am particularly drawn the P73 as I can have an RTX 3000 card in it the i7 still have the space for a 2.5 drive which the P53 does not offer I will put my current SSD that I am using in my T520 in the new laptop . Plus a 17 screen is attractive as I am largely sedentary at my desk. I will have it connected a 27 1440p external monitor. I can also get more for less money the P73 over the P53 mainly the RTX 3000 option which isn't there the P53 . My main questions are 1. Will the P73 have the same durability that my T520 has had? My assumption is yes 2. I am tempted go for the 4k screen as I will not be mobile will have it plugged in most of the time I do occasionally edit video. Also in 5 years I can see where 4k will have become much more common. If battery life gaming are not an issue are there any reasons for me not get the 4k screen? Are scaling issues really that prevalent? Also the FHD option on the P73 the only other screen option is somewhat underwhelming. 3. Should I wait for the P17 specs be released? Or I see a good price for the P73 on the memorial day sale should I go ahead buy it? 4. Should I get a 16gb RAM stick or 2 8 GB sticks? I plan upgrade the RAM in the future 5. Are the heating issues of the P73/P53 really bad enough warrant not purchasing/waiting see the new P line updates have improved the cooling solution? I will not engage in prolonged/sustained heavy graphical work but will run programs such as BlueStacks edit video up 4k resolution. Thank in advance for your assistance.

1,gleed0,thinkpad,0,2020/05/18 04:14:13,Night,p53 Quadro strange behavior pulsing temperature clock. After using USG thinkpads for a while I became a convert recently purchased my very own for quite an obscene sum of money the rtx5000 xeon. With my quadro 5000 I have observed some very strange behavior that I'm wondering anyone is also experiencing or knows it is only the symptom of a software problem or a sign of a more concerning hardware problem. When idle sometimes while under load the gpu temperature pulses from a false reading of 0.0c true temp. I'm unsure in the chicken/egg scenario this is affecting the clock or vice versa but both clocks are also exhibiting a pulsing behavior. The scope of the problem is even more alarming I use a monitor that does 100ms ticks. Idle Immediately resumes upon leaving a load Nvidia drivers BIOS chip set windows etc are all up date I've had the computer less than a week. I reached out directly nvidia they said quadro shouldn't be doing that but didn't offer anything more constructive. I have a ticket in Lenovo but haven't heard back yet. Troubleshooting I've tried enabling/disabling hybrid or discrete graphics only see it's some sort of argument between Intel graphics the GPU but that doesn't seem affect anything. Reinstalled all drivers no change.

The SL500 worked fine on Windows7 but I wanted upgrade - since I am using Microsoft account. And there' s a problem. I can't find drivers that supports both Windows 10 OpenGL. I tried drivers for Vista but they seems not work leaving me Basic Graphics Card drivers from Windows Update doesn't have support for OpenGL. Reason I stick Win10 is that it's really faster than Win7 even the available ram is half of whats installed D That's strange.. For example - Minecraft on Win7 worked perfectly - so the Microsoft drivers HAD the OpenGL support now it doesn't? Anyone got idea where I can find something working?

And now I find myself snooping from day day on Lenovo's website for a second laptop. My first is an X1C7 which I l have been thoroughly satisfied . The future plan is get my workstation up running a widescreen monitor dual laptops. I am looking for something more screen real estate doesn't compromise on power the decision has boiled down either the P1 Gen 2 or the X1 Extreme Gen 2. Main usages will be do a lot of browsing multiple tabs open watching Youtube for research compile decks in Google slides or Powerpoint playing indie games on Steam the occassional Netflix. I may also use it do some light video editing in the future for my channel. What would guys suggest?

There are two adjustments which make this ultra-book significantly faster cooler. I do not recommend repasting its just nonsensical. There are only two basic changes made significant temp decrease benchmark increase. Note the X1 Extreme's Core i7-8750H is benchmarking in the top 89% of ALL processors. Which means this X1 Extreme I configured runs faster than nearly 90% of all DELL MAC ETC other systems/configurations this same processor. Here are result steps below. Cinebench R15 score 1178 up from 966 . Lenovo 20MF000BUS - UserBenchmarks Game 39% Desk 108% Work 79% Full Result Intel Core i7-8750H Nvidia GTX 1050-Ti Mobile Max-Q SSD WDC PC SN720 SDAQNTW-512G-1001 512GB RAM Samsung M471A2K43CB1-CTD 1x16GB Quick context - the i7 8750H is incredibly powerful. To access the full power of SIX cores the system must stay cool. Lenovo's cooling system outperforms Dell HP in testing significantly outperforms the Mac Book Pro. So its already just about as fast as can get in a light thin laptop- but its going get hot when running all that power. The steps below help keep your processor running at full potential - its a safe sound no chance of harm. The two-step process must be performed in this order Start by turning off Lenovo intelligent cooling set the button performance. Also set your power mode Best Performance. 1 OPEN MSI Afterburner RUN OC SCAN This is new tech on latest GPUs. This will automatically run adjust clock speeds while also undervolting your Nvidia GPU its max stable state. This will greatly reduce GPU temps improve framerates. It will also allow your CPU run faster when both GPU CPU are under load gaming etc because it will not be drawing as much power away will generate less heat - leading NO thermal throttling. Your system is smart it protects itself. NOTE This automatic process will not change the memory speed slider can do that manually after. Slide it up 450Mhz for safe sound performance. Save this profile lets move on. 2 OPEN Intel XTU safely securely undervolt. A child could do this. First please forget or ignore all the bloat may have read posted by extreme tuners which overcomplicate. Forget about throttlestop. Some people are trying change their processor too much - trust me the uber science nerds at Intel thought of all this already millions in research development. I doubt can balance the needs of your processor better... The ONLY reason we can improve performance here is because we know the one thing that Intel did not know when they made the processor. Intel does not know what laptop their processor is going end up in. It has work in a Mac Book or a Dell etc. different specs cooling. We do know that this processor is incredibly consistent. Meaning they nearly all undervolt the same way. Totally safe Intel's official XTU app gives the only settings need adjust your i7 your unique system. Configure your X1 Extreme as follows Open the XTU app simply slide the slider labeled Core Voltage Offset down -0.150 V You are done. If like can add additional performance safely by also moving the turbo boost power max up 75.000W for both short max. Your X1 will not allow add too much power. Sliding this up is removing any software handicap - the processor will still limit power per intel specs. Your X1 like your car is monitoring itself has hard limits which can not be changed by a slider bar duh. Make sure apply changes close restart. Open the app on restart confirm values are set. Expect see large gains in frames games benchmarks everyday processing. Anything beyond this is splitting hairs. Would like conclude a final word on this system. In my research I have seen post complaining about X1 temp thermal throttling etc. Some folks report that they retuned the system.. imagine the frustration only find that ALL ultra-books get hot under load. To be clear - do not need change anything about this machine - it is a beast out of box the temps are outstanding for an ultra book. Its never hot unless gaming when under load really can not do better without defying the laws of physics. I sometimes wonder commenters understand that actual electric is running through system a lot of it. Touch a 15W light after an hour. Here we have 45 W in a chip the size of your thumb. Fire. Hot. Mac Book Pro prefer slow cool - Lastly kindly note that watch HD movies in bed then buy an iPad. This is professional machine serious power - outperforms pretty much any other laptop on market most desktops. All best!

See my other post for details I have been researching finally found the approach tune the trackpad a good usable level. It is still no better than Macbook Pro my last HP Spectre but is much better than what it was. 1. If have a stock Lenovo Windows 10 installation. You can skip this step. 1. Install Latest trackpad driver from Lenovo Vantage or Lenovo official website. 2. Important ! Go Microsoft Store install Synaptics Touchpad Control Panel . 2. Go system settings Touchpad Settings. 1. Limit cursor speed 7. Personally I use 5. 2. Scroll down there is a Synaptics Touchpad part. Click settings 1. Set sensitivity all the way the max. In my case it's 57. 2. Set palm check 4. 3. Disable Edge Region Filtering. 3. As pointed by other redditors this seems be irreverent. It's might be for the trackpoint Important ! Open Registry Editor 1. Go HKEY LOCAL MACHINE SOFTWARE Synaptics SynTP Stick 2. There is a TouchThreshold change that value 0. These steps worked on my T495. It should be applicable on similar models as well. Now should have a much better trackpad experience ! Let me know have such issues this helps .
5,gl1b2g,thinkpad,3,2020/05/17 12:02:07,Morning,Thinking of getting my first modern Thinkpad Unfortunately my budget is pathetic can only afford about 300. However that leaves room for some good deals still. I’m tempted by some cheap i5 T470 Thinkpads I can see on eBay but I can’t afford them until next month by which time they may be gone. Otherwise I’ll likely aim for a lower model like a T460. If I go the latter route how much would I be missing out on? Do they have essentially the same keyboard? I keep hearing enormous praise for the T470 keyboard while the T460 one isn’t mentioned. Are they different? I’ll be using it mainly for word processing maybe some light video editing. Is the T470 that much faster? Would the T460 be really slow? For reference my current piece of junk laptop is a Lenovo G50-70 that I got around 2015. It’s a Core i3 4005U 4GB RAM a dreadful keyboard eternally glitchy trackpad unreliable SD card port dying hard drive the case is falling apart. It even hates Linux.

1,gl7y4d,thinkpad,1,2020/05/17 18:57:29,Afternoon,Might've bricked my T490 A string of odd behaviors by my T490 questionable decisions by myself led it no longer boot or even POST. It started when my Linux install crashed failed at shutting down I force powered it off. Then I booted into windows update the TB3 firmware fix this however that just disappeared then Windows hung while rebooting so another force power off. I booted into Windows one last time performed some Windows Updates again it hung while rebooting I force powered it off. When I tried boot back into Windows it hung at a black screen after entering the Windows bootloader even holding the power button would not work. Finally figured out how turn it off by pressing the emergency reset button on the bottom but now it does not even attempt boot. The current state is when I power it on the keyboard backlight flashes then it hangs the power light on the fan spinning. It doesn't respond holding the power button so I have press the emergency reset button power it off. Because the problem manifests so early I force powered off after firmware updates I'm worried the firmware may be corrupted. Is there any way fix this? I did a little bit of research cut short by my T420 overheating due a dead fan I saw some people suggest resetting the CMOS. I assume I could due that by disconnecting the battery removing the coin cell holding the power button. Is this a good thing try or could it make it worse? My T490 is still covered by warranty would they be able handle this? Should I try resetting the CMOS before trying warranty? I'd be removing my SSD before warranty so it would be really easy.

T440? would that work? i was looking at new laptops for 250 on bestbuy but i learned they are extremely slow 2GB. I think i will need something 6-8GB. I am very unclear on processors so i cannot filter those make sure i will be compatible. No gaming. just for school work youtubeing.

I can't choose between the following Door1 P1 Gen 2 9750H 4k IPS matte 32GB ram 512GB SSD T2000 GPU 1650 Door 2 P1 Gen 1 8750H 4k Glossy 40GB ram 512GB nvme 2TB sata P2000 GPU 1570 I don't mind 4K or glossy as I'm never too far from an outlet.

Personal use YouTube photo editing. I'm leaning towards the Gen 1 just for better value looks like it'd cost close 300usd get the gen 2 up the same spec. Are there any 1st gen teething issues the gen 1 I should look out for?

2,gky1nj,thinkpad,22,2020/05/17 09:00:15,Morning,About To Buy a Thinkpad E15 Basically my last laptop died back in December it was thick boi also a grandpa tbh hp g62 8 year old . It was a hand me down from my big brother I used it survive through High school stuff. Well when it broke I was lucky enough that my friend let me borrow his baby X220 . Using it for two months I literally love the Lenovo spark. Now I’ve made a decision after gathering up money . To finally buy myself a first Lenovo I start from the E series. My reasons 1 I’ll be able learn by customising well the Ram the ssd etc. That’s pretty much what change also the battery which isn’t going die that quick 2 the T series here Pakistan are basically very expensive for whatever reason. 3 I don’t really care about the display as I’ve read a lot of reviews about Lenovo E series shit display even FHD. 4 It’s in my budget tbh I don’t buy any other brand. I join the lenovo hype gang that’s the most significant part lol Jkjk 5 This laptop will be used for baby level programming so University work computer science student . Specs I’ll be buying which is available in my country i7 10th gen 8gb Ram 1Tb HDD ik . . I wanted an SSD but I can upgrade that later which I save up money in 3 months get a good one FHD display 2Gb AMD graphic card correct me I wrote it wrong etc rest is history. My Question If ’ve read the specs list then ’ll be asking me why I’m buying a HDD so basically in my country there’s limited Lenovo’s available anyways. And the only I can get my hands on are an HDD whilst I can later buy an SDD by myself. It sucks used refurbished laptops here are not trusted because people are scammers most of them tbh. So my question would be that I’ve a very indecisive person • •. Should I go through this purchase? I’ll be placing an order on Monday. Addition potential purchases I’m considering I’ll probs get a Cooling padding it’s on sale as I’ve heard about the average ventilation. Cost Well it’s going cost me 140K PKR rupees that’s almost 900USD?? I think. Expensive right? It’s how it is 😭 here. Update I GOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL ON E590. So I went for they it costed me 700 USD Saved 200 bucks which I put into buying the SSD For the same specs without 10th gen afc minus the Graphic card. So far I’m very happy the build!! Def does feel like a budget premium laptop. With the money saved I got a good SDD • • plan upgrade the ram as well! just for future proofing!! Bless all of for the suggestions.

2,gkw8ap,thinkpad,9,2020/05/17 07:13:46,Morning,Need help buying a Thinkpad I'm a comp sci student looking buy a new laptop I heard Thinkpads were pretty good. It's mostly going be for daily use anything else I may need do. The issue I have right now is that there are so many options for Thinkpads that I feel kind of lost. I was wondering any of guys could guide me in the right direction or atleast give some recomendations. Price isn't the biggest issue for me but cheaper would be greatly appreciated. It needs have a good enough battery last me through the day it also needs be sturdy enough handle my daily abuse I tend handle my laptops quite roughly . I plan on using this for many years come so having it be future proof is a must. I enjoy being able rip things apart tinker them mostly cause I tend break them a lot so it'd be nice that's possible as well. Since I plan on carrying this around me daily a lighter option would be nice. I heard buying second hand Thinkpads then replacing them newer components is a viable option as it can save a good deal of money but I can't seem find any for super cheap. I don't know this makes a difference but I also plan on throwing Linux on the device the minute I get it.

There have been many many reports of people having issues their X1 Carbon Gen 7 batteries. Specifically an error stating Battery not detected the inability use the laptop without the charger plugged into the wall. I've seen a few posts on this subreddit about the issue. POSSIBLE SOLUTION This issue has been plaguing me for some time. Recently I encountered a Lenovo forum thread on the topic Apparently this is a really big issue many X1 Carbon owners firmware updates don't seem be fixing it. However a few people on the forum reported they found a solution that can be done at home. I will quote it exactly Solution Disable battery in bios 2. Remove back cover 3. Disconnect battery connector from motherboard 4. Reconnect the battery connector Credit alifamzari on the Lenovo forums for that guide. I did this solution myself last night so far so good. It wasn't hard at all especially after watching the videos. Granted it's only been a day for me. However other people on the Lenovo forum have reported that this solution has worked for them for a long period of time. No guarantees this will permanently fix the issue but it seems be working for many people is an okay alternative having send in the laptop for repair. Note please do attempt this make sure follow the directions very carefully especially about first disabling the battery in bios for safety. Hope this helps!

But I've caught the thinkpad bug I really love the tactile feel of the keyboard! I'm considering getting an x270 for a few reasons let me explain my preferences needs reasoning so I could get feedback --I'll primarily be using it for document processing web browsing etc. And after this experience the 11e I never go back 4gb ram again it shouldn't lag doing simple tasks! -- I prefer smaller screens because bigger screens aggravate my migraines at least when trying get work done eg my desktop monitor at 20 inches. I've become accustomed 11.6 inches wonder I could tolerate 14 inches like the T series but am not sure. I also it be portable as a student. Thus also need good battery --I'm considering the x270 specifically because it was released for a few reasons 1. I have a sensory processing disorder can't tolerate the feeling of dust deep in an item hey at the bottom it says see also autism so yeah 2. 2017 seems the best last year they didn't solder the ram wanna try upgrade it because why not. note a friend will be doing it for me I don't see the point in buying a much older x series a few hundred dollars in upgrades why not get the new one So the cheapest x270's I've come across are 400 on ebay it generally seems like laptop prices have undergone inflation because covid. I also am considering buying maxed out t490's I've come across for like 800-900 because why not seems worth it for longevity though again not sure about the screen. Do guys think the x270 would fit me well? What should I go for? Please feel free guide me recommend other models. Thanks so much!!

A little background. I'm an Automation/Robotics Engineering Instructor for a local community college. I primarily teach the basics of AC/DC Digital Fundamentals 3 phase Industrial Motor Control/Power Applications PLC Troubleshooting thrown in for good measure. My background however previous specialty was embedded hardware engineering design. As such I've convinced my college provide the necessary tooling do any manner of PCB design assembly diagnostics. So I can easily handle the necessary desoldering resoldering of a relatively simple single BGA chip. Even at 1440 pins. My question s is more on the thinkpad/laptop specific side of things. I know it's possible throw a Coffee Lake CPU into a Skylake Motherboard Z370 Z170.. etc so in theory it should be possible do the same most/any FCBGA1440 CPU the same TDP. Desktop class motherboards do not equate laptops the same hardware modifications required may not be so easily performed or possible on the laptop but that's not my immediate concern. What I am interested in wondering about is someone like klem would be able update the BIOS UEFI microcode accommodate for the additional CPU. Once my P50 arrives next Friday I will take it apart see I can find the same equitable hardware modification locations on the mainboard but I play around the theoretical possibilities until then create a discourse in the process. Basically I provide the same or similar level of upgrade of the 51nb products x210 x62...etc but without the entire re-work of a PCB/Mainboard. So there have it let me know what think. Oh here's a picture of my Lab. x200B

I should note that the laptop worked fine when it had the 18.04 version that it's not the first installation that does this either since I remember having the same issue 19.10 too. Should note that the Windows 10 installation in dual boot works perfectly fine that there are no SMART errors on the SSD either so I doubt it's got something do faulty hardware mine is the model the i5-3320M.

I guess my question is is the crawling issue due RAM or do think it's just a device that wasn't mean be put through this kinda usage? I keep beating myself up over not going 16GB of RAM but maybe that wouldn't have significantly improved my situation anyway. I have a small apartment I haven't owned a PC since I was a kid using dial-up. I've owned nothing but laptops since then. Maybe it's time fork up the cash for a small workstation? IDK.. I guess I'm kinda asking for tips in my situation. I'm a graduate student majoring in cyber security so I really should invest in a powerful machine but I am a student so your boy is BROKE so yea lemme know what think we'll go from there lol. Thank for reading though this thank for any input that have.

On Windows 10 which I hadn’t deleted yet I use Lenovo Vantage in order monitor the battery life keep it healthy I’m on Linux then supposedly it still works even when I’m not one windows since it only says “charging” but doesn’t go down or up this Thinkpad takes a week plus go down a percent on Windows so it might be the same on Linux. Thing is I tried disabling it one windows turning off the threshold it didn’t work it would still charge past the threshold even after setting it TPL. Anyway I can get the battery threshold options working? My district is Manjaro Linux I have TLP installed I have acpi call installed on Linux itself. still new so I’m trying set this up confirm it works since I don’t a windows partition just for managing battery.

However today I applied for government funding because of the virus it was my intention purchase a ThinkPad T480s. My dad told me that I wasn't purchase the T480s because he may or may not have already purchased the T460s. I'm irritated because I communicated them told them that I wanted get the newer model so that the performance would be better by getting an older model I am going need buy a brand new battery from Lenovo get the computer working like new. I'm thankful that I'm getting a ThinkPad at all but I'm not sure the T480s is as big of an upgrade as I thought that it would be or it is no contest a better computer.

Pre-covid I mostly worked the laptop closed external keyboard/monitor so obviously can't use face unlock that way. But recently working from home I've been working on the laptop the screen open it finally dawned on me give face unlock a try. I've only used it a few times but wow I'm impressed. It's so fast that I didn't even see it log me in the first time I had logoff try again make sure it was actually doing something. It's definitely faster easier than the fingerprint scanner or typing a password. Just thought I'd mention this in case there is anyone else like me who never bothered give it a try.

I have about 400 total spend after taxes but in a perfect world I would only like spend 300. Everywhere I look search refurbished thinkpad is the answer that I get. The only thing that turns me off about thinkpads is the fact that I would have buy an older one will probably not be able upgrade it myself. For me needs budget the T440p is what I keep coming . I am not super thrilled about how bulky it looks but my limited budget I can get over it. I’m just worried that maybe a thinkpad that is that old that will not be upgraded might not be worth it. My needs are pretty low. At maximum I would have 3 chrome tabs Microsoft word Spotify a lightweight game opened at the same time. The only game I play is OldSchool Runescape which is a browser-based game from 2007 so pretty low requirements.

2,gkng3b,thinkpad,5,2020/05/16 19:07:48,Evening,What causes a battery stop charging? Is it repairable? I had a T61P for over a decade without any battery issues. It had a few other issues due wear so I replaced it a cheap refurbished T430S in 2018. The battery on the refurbished was first used in 2013 but the max capacity was something like 95% of the original. Two years later the max capacity is 65% it lasted quite a while off the charger. I don't take it off of a/c very often when I do it is usually only for 30mins. Last night I had the laptop off of a/c got the battery down 5% remaining charge. I plugged it in the battery charges 70% stops. I open up the Lenovo power manager see a message battery failed due normal wear cannot charge replace it . I am a little shocked but not really because so far the T430S has been a piece of shit quality wise compared my T61P - how does a 70% capacity battery stop charging / fail? I haven't taken a multimeter the laptop or battery see what is at fault. I assume it is the battery not the charging circuit. I don't buy a new battery since I rarely use it off a/c. So as per title can a failed battery be repaired?

Has anyone else experienced this? It's kinda a dealbreaker for me since I prefer use the touchpad for mouse movement the trackpoint buttons for clicking. It seems the response on the Lenovo forums was just deal it that leads me believe it might simply be a hardware thing that I can't do anything about.

1,gp9s6u,AcerOfficial,0,2020/05/24 10:20:47,Morning,“No signal” when connecting Surface Book 2 Acer XF270H monitor I am trying hook up my new Acer XF270H monitor my Surface Book 2 but I keep getting “no signal.” I am using a usb-c HDMI cable connect the two. The monitor works when I connect my Nintendo Switch Xbox iPad it. To connect the iPad the monitor I’m using the same usb-c hdmi cable that I’m using the surface book 2 so the cable itself doesn’t seem be the issue. I can also connect the surface other monitors TVs using the same cable no problems. That makes it seem like the computer itself isn’t the problem either. My Surface “sees” the monitor as it’s available in the settings such. It only seems like the monitor is not picking up the signal from the laptop. I’ve ordered a usb-c DisplayPort adapter that will be arriving tomorrow see that changes anything. Until now however I’m lost trying figure out the problem. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank !

4,govk2r,AcerOfficial,10,2020/05/23 16:47:58,Afternoon,Acer Swift 1 takes 6 minutes reboot It's getting longer longer each time. I've had the Acer Swift 1 laptop for nearly a year a half. It started out reasonably fast a few seconds has gotten slower slower. Specs of computer Acer Swift 1 SF114-32 laptop 4GB memory 64 GB internal flash storage added 128 GB SD card for files. Internal flash storage has 15% free space left. Pentium Silver N5000. BIOS mode UEFI. Windows 10 x64 build 18363. Every time I reboot it displays acer a circle of spinning dots underneath for more than 6 minutes before giving me the Windows 10 login screen. I've tried the following none have helped 1. Turning off on fast boot in BIOS 2. Turning off on fast startup in Windows 3. Updating BIOS from 1.03 1.12 latest 4. Disabling Windows 10 startup items 5. Disabling unessential Windows 10 services 6. Defragging the SSD flash drive I usually don't defrag since it's a SSD flash drive 7. Cleaning the Windows registry 8. Removing unused apps 9. Turning off Windows Defender my only AV 10. Updating all drivers 11. Used CCleaner remove unnecessary files 12. Used Windows Cleanup in Admin mode remove unnecessary files including system files 13. Upgraded latest version of Windows The windows event services don't record anything for those 6 or so minutes which leads me believe it's not a Windows issue but is happening before Windows even starts. BIOS problem? SSD problem? Ideas? Thank .
0,gov06v,AcerOfficial,0,2020/05/23 16:12:00,Afternoon,Questions on the Acer Nitro XV3 I found it refurbished on Amazon eBay for 699 free shipping. For 4k at 144Hz it seems like a good deal. But I have a couple of questions about it as I am having trouble finding information about it 1. Is the Acer Nitro XV3 the same as the Nitro XV273K? 2. Does it have a VESA mount? How about a headphone jack? 3. Does Acer have good quality control? 4. I'm hoping replace my current LG Monitor this monitor. My LG Monitor is suffering from Edge Discoloration which will eventually engulf the entire screen. It is also surprisingly suffering from burn-in too. Is Acer known for its reliability? How about their warranties? Thanks in advance!

I was looking around for 2-in1s detachable laptops that supported Wacom EMR found the Acer Switch 7 the Concept D7 D9. I already knew about the D9 - but after seeing the amount of time that had passed since the previous updates I've started think the devices are going be cancelled. The Switch 7 was hard find online - it's not even on ebay! But the Concept D7 seems like a a spiritual successor of sorts. That said I haven't heard anything about it for months - are we getting configuration options? Downgraded/Upgraded options? Was the project axed?

I know this is a bit of a lame post but never know the power of the community! I have an Acer Aspire V17 Nitro Black Edition VN7-792G that's five years old now but was going on strong. The only thing that was wrong it was I was running out of storage so thought I'd take the opportunity upgrade the RAM as well as the SSD HDD. I was able dismantle the laptop replace all of these components but found after reassembling it that it would not boot. The laptop would power on but it wouldn't even enter BIOS all I could do was switch it off by holding the power button down. I put the original components back in the laptop was able boot it once. I don't know what I did that was different on that occasion all other times I've tried but apart from that one instance I haven't been able boot it again. Same problem - black screen no BIOS. The laptop beeps when I plug unplug the charger but that's it. I know there's not much go on here but I am posting in the hope that maybe someone has some useful experience they can impart on me. Maybe there's something simple I've forgotten do that someone else found out the hard way? Fingers crossed!

1,gj7ds2,AcerOfficial,4,2020/05/14 12:45:50,Morning,Need help my new Acer Predator Triton 500 Oculus link VR....I'm having a nightmare!! So....My new laptop is the Acer Predator Triton 500 specs are 16gb Ram CPU i7 9750H GPU RTX 2060 6gb vRam 2x 512GB NVMe SSD I did a lot of research before I bought this it has glowing reviews across the board should be definitely VR capable. I have the Anker cable that Oculus recommends for Oculus Link. So I set it up got the green tick of approval....All good so far. But then I just got the dreaded 3 dots in my headset - for ages I couldn't figure out what do. Eventually I disabled the Intel graphics card thus forcing the RTX 2060 GPU became the default. I still had the same issues 3 dots . I then went into the power settings of my USB's unticked the power saving on each of them. Bingo!! That worked......no more 3 dots I'm in the Oculus Rift home! Hurrah!!! I'd like say that's where my tale ends but alas I must continue my story of woe.... I download Robo Recall I had been playing this over Virtual Desktop using Shadow PC's service fine but I was looking forward finally being able play this lag free or near as damn it because link cable trumps VD in that department right? . As soon as it loads the title screen I know something is terribly wrong major black bars when I move my head - this can't be right? I didn't even have this when I used Shadow PC over VD . So basically it's unplayable. I then download Steam VR Google Earth VR. I am in the Steam VR Home....all fine dandy. I click on Google Earth I'm taken that bit where wait while it loads........except it doesn't load it just boots me straight back Steam VR Home!!! I keep trying...same thing! WTF!!! Ok maybe - just maybe - it's the cable it's still in beta after all right? . So I download the Virtual Desktop streamer put my Oculus nickname in..... open up the side loaded version of Virtual Desktop in my Quest like how I always used do when subscribed Shadow . It finds my Acer laptop instantly connects immediately...........wow things are looking up. Maybe I can resign myself using Virtual Desktop for my PC gaming. I fire up Robo Recall again......but my absolute horror I'm getting those major black bars again when I move my head!! So that rules out the issue being the Oculus Link. Guys I don't know what do......surely my laptop is powerful enough run VR ok? Surely! I haven't had a Windows pc for years years having got a Macbook so I'm a bit rusty on the operating system. Is there something blindingly obvious I should have done? Any step I missed? Someone please please help!

When I've got the laptop at full charge plugged in it keeps constantly beeping as I removed the charger even though it's plugged in.

About 2 months ago I did a clean install of windows without all the bloatware. I made a backup of the drive before the clean install but never got around doing a backup after a clean install. I was playing a game paused it for a bit while I was checking some stuff on my other computer. The laptop beeps gets a BSOD a critical process died error. It then reboots I get the no bootable media found error. Drive still shows up in the bios. I boot off a usb partition utility it shows up as unallocated. Nothing important was on it just windows steam. My steam library is in the secondary sata ssd I had installed. Out of curiosity I tried using partition recovery data recovery software even scanning all sectors on the drive it's basically completely empty. I'll lose time reinstalling windows/drivers steam however I've never had this happen or know anyone who's had this happen them. I'm a bit dissapointed as I assume the nvme kingston drive that came the laptop is faulty. x200B Hopefully install goes ok I'll check smart data see anything comes up. Has anyone heard of this happening or had this happen them? Kinda weird the drive would be completely wiped. Edit Looks like drive is dead windows installer says it can't install it giving error 0x80300002. If I try format drive manually it gives error 0x97b65de0. I'll have look into the warranty.

We barely met only 1-2 times a year unfortunately I have no idea what type of laptop she exactly has. I only know it's an Acer laptop it's an older one. Possibly 15 -ish but not sure. I found a very low quality picture where it's visible how it looks like where the logo is positioned I tried figure it out by google searches but no luck so far. I cropped it from the original picture. I see the Acer logo positioned on the top-left the wrist rest part seems colored differently. Maybe have a better idea by these parameters.

1,gejyt5,AcerOfficial,0,2020/05/07 05:25:58,Night,Acer Predator Z271U strange flashing white lines at the bottom Hello. I have purchased a Z271U display a couple of months ago until now it was amazing. Recently though I have noticed something strange happening at the bottom of the screen. I have a stripe of static faint horizontal white lines which is about 2cm tall over it there's a taller stripe about 3.5 cm of faint horizontal lines which turns on for 1 second then turns off for 1 second repeatedly The monitor was working perfectly fine for several months was never damaged in any way. Could this be a loose connection somewhere or is this a panel damage ? Already tested the cables gpus it's definitely something the monitor itself. Additionally enabling/disabling any gpmonitor features doesn't make any difference.

Is it 1440p or 1080p are there other monitors in the Z1 line? My second question is it is 1440p do know a Nvidia GTX 1070 can handle it in games like Rainbow 6 Valorant The Crew 2? Thanks!!

1,gdtn31,AcerOfficial,3,2020/05/06 00:06:01,Night,Anyone else have way too slow charging via Thunderbolt port? I bought a Swift 5 SF514-54GT i7-1065G7 MX 250 a while ago. I also bought a CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 dock. The dock is great except that the laptop's state of charge slowly decreases during usage. The dock can sustain 87W charging which would be more than enough for this laptop even at full load. I've checked the charge rate during light desktop usage low screen brightness the average is 1.7W. Removing the dock cable the discharge rate is -8.5W. This is a bit crude but it shows the dock only charges by around 10W. My question is anyone else is running an Acer laptop preferably the Swift 5 charging it through a Thunderbolt 3 dock? Does charging work as expected?

1,gdkt1n,AcerOfficial,0,2020/05/05 13:41:15,Afternoon,Acer X35 fan noise or lack thereof  I recently picked up the X35 last week. First thing I did was update it Acer’s latest firmware update which went smoothly. I have the DisplayPort input connected my gaming PC the HDMI input connected my work laptop. With my gaming PC I never heard any fan noise coming from the monitor but thought it might be because my PC’s fan noise which isn’t very loud was drowning out any fan noise coming from the monitor. Today was the first day I’m using the monitor my work laptop for a brief second the monitor’s video cut out. I felt under the monitor make sure the connections were good they were. But I also felt it was quite warm where the monitor connections were. And so far I have not heard any fan noise coming from the monitor my laptop is dead silent. I’m wondering the fans are even coming on at all. Has anyone else experienced this should I be concerned?

3,gcj2md,AcerOfficial,7,2020/05/03 18:38:49,Afternoon,So My Predator 15 Just Died After Almost 4 Years. As the titles states my predator 15 just died out of the blue. I have not overclocked nor altered any system/hardware settings. I was playing Metro Exodus when right before shooting at a mutant the game froze did not respond alt f4 nor could I alt tab forcing me hold down the power button. However I then let go of it thought I'd try alt f4 one last time since I hate forcing the shutdown. Nevertheless a few seconds later the computer did manage shutdown but at the same time even the led indicating that the battery is charging was not lighting up. I also realized that I could not charge my phone using the USB which allows charging even when the laptop is powered off this makes me assume that something happened the motherboard. Is there anyone here that can maybe help me out? It's really frustrating as I've taken really good care of this laptop I got it for my studies abroad of course game. I have a course starting soon for the summer then a semester in autumn. This laptop was not supposed die on me this way it is too soon even it for whatever reason was it's time expire it should have done it when I'm done my studies. So any help would be much appreciated or ideas. I've hit the battery reset I've made sure the switch near the m2 slots are pressed used tape . I've tried power cycle unplug hold the power button . I believe I've done everything that can be done. I haven't got tools dig deeper though nor do I believe I could fix it the problem is the motherboard. Kind regards Dave

When I try flash the official BIOS PO3-A3 over SPI it doesn't match the chipsize 4MB chip 2MB .rom . The version written on the board itself is PO3-A2 but the only rom I find that name is from an Aspire Z3770 but it does get closer the needed size which makes me think it misses a sector in the beginning as flashrom also gave out Expected 0xff Found 0x9c Expected 0xff Found 0x00 in different places because the BIOS from the Aspire is a bit over 3MB. If it helps the chip is a Winbond W25Q32.V My question now is does anyone have a full eeprom dump or maybe something nudge me into the right direction? And also what are the jumper configurations wanna flash over SPI the resource situation for this board/pc is pretty dire... Thanks in advance

Basic booting from ssd gives all the factory-installed stuff working drivers all that including wifi . Force booting the hdd where i have a diff win10 installed through BIOS at first required some auto setup but everything seemed functional ms office matlab some softwares games save for the lack of working wifi touchpad ethernet misc graphic drivers I dont care for yet . At first I thought I could just install drivers from the Acer page be good go. But I cannot run either of the proposed wifi drivers on their download page intel killer because both of them lacked a simple exe launcher of some sort. I even tried a few wifi drivers from intel's site but the exe just refused run?? Installing random files i had lying around worked just fine but this driver just wont. Im considering downloading a generic qualcomm wifi driver but im not sure which version would even work. What's weird is that the preinstalled ssd is working flawlessly for wifi. So i thought that maybe theres some weird permissions setup I hadnt looked at in the BIOS but that seems implausible. I cant exactly check that now myself since im running a full backup before I try anything else.
3,g8rlyh,AcerOfficial,0,2020/04/27 18:10:46,Afternoon,Nitro 5 AN515-54 Windows ClearType ignores settings on secondary monitor Posting this here because I'm wondering among other things it could be some laptop-specific issue but I could be wrong. I have an Acer Nitro 5 model AN515-54 I'm trying use it an external monitor the laptop screen serving extend the display. The monitor the laptop display have the same native resolution 1920x1080 refresh rate 60Hz colour settings RGB . I'm using the Windows-recommended scaling for each 125% for the laptop screen 100% for the monitor . The setup mostly works well except for problems ClearType. Whichever display I've set as the main one determines the ClearType settings for both. In other words the appearance of text on the secondary display changes as I calibrate ClearType for the primary one but does not respond when I calibrate the monitor on which it's actually displayed. ClearType settings for the main display whether it's the laptop screen or the external monitor are applied across the board. As can imagine this is frustrating as the displays use different values for scaling - it means I have pick one of my monitors be the blurry one . Strangely enough no other calibration settings are affected - for instance I can independently control the colour balance of each. I've also verified that it has nothing do the external display itself the problem persisted a different monitor the scaling setting the laptop 100% for consistency the external monitor didn't help or any drivers problem persisted before after updating drivers for all monitors as well as the Intel UHD NVIDIA GeForce cards . This may be a problem in Windows itself but I also wonder it has something do the GPU's. The laptop display is connected the internal Intel GPU but the HDMI port is connected the discrete NVIDIA card. When I click Identify displays in the NVIDIA Control Panel the number 1 appears on both monitors although Windows itself correctly identifies them separately . Also the laptop display disappears from the PhysX configuration when I plug in the external monitor. I'm wondering the GeForce is somehow treating them as parts of the same display this behaviour is somehow influencing that of ClearType? Any help is greatly appreciated - I've been Googling like crazy haven't found anything about this specific issue beyond re-installing the drivers . For reference I am using Version 1809 of Windows 10 the NVIDIA card is the GeForce GTX 1050.

I had a feeling the port was going as the wiggle was loose would beep repeatedly when turned on till it got settled. Well the unthinkable happened last Saturday my son tripped over the cord while it was plugged in the cord brick flew the carpet. Plugged the cord back in no blue charging light no worries I'm sure it just needs a new port. Found an aftermarket on Prime had it 2 days installed today. Still no dice. For the record this is a plug play cord that doesn't need be soldered. I have posted the difference between the two. My next stop is check the voltage of the charger when I find my voltmeter. Am I missing something here? Should I try track down an OEM port? Many thanks in advance. x200B x200B 
1,g6z1ok,AcerOfficial,0,2020/04/24 17:07:10,Afternoon,Monitor issue.. confusing. I’ve had my PS4 hooked a monitor ACER S241HL for a few months no issues until one night. just stopped waking up. One day I turned the PS4 on my monitor comes out of sleep yellow light on power button turns blue I get “no signal” message on screen then goes back sleep. I’ve tried 3 separate HDMI cables all same result. Even tried booting it in safe mode. No video at all. I verified it’s not the PS4 as Ive hooked it up the original HDMI cable my TV I have video. I’ve hooked up my laptop the monitor as a second screen my Xbox One the monitor. I get video output ago the monitor. Now tonight.. no video. Since I can’t use my PS4 on it I’ve been using it an older desktop computer since its worked just fine until tonight.. wake up the computer.. “no video” message. I plug the HDMI cable into my laptop.. the screen works. I'm confused on what is going on.

And the cpu keeps on thermal throttling at rather low temps like at 70 degrees celsius it throttles down 0.8Ghz. This results in huge performance drops.

9,g3iv0c,AcerOfficial,3,2020/04/18 22:20:48,Evening,Acer Nitro V - how increase stabilize gaming performance TL DR below I've been messing my VN7-593G i7-7700 GTX 1060 for around 1.5 years now thought I'd share everything I found actually substantially increases gaming performance since out-of-the-box it's kind of a mess sometimes. Just a warning - we're going off-warranty some of these steps don't know what 're doing could harm your system so proceed caution at your own risk always check other tutorials for the specific steps. First up - when it's running at full speed the machine is actually quite the beast for its small price tag. Sadly it almost never gets run at full speed. I've had various issues here sometimes the GPU clock voltage were just generally lower than they should be sometimes it would drop from 1600MHz 130 ! for 1-2 seconds every 10 seconds. I'm not sure exactly what the dynamic is here but my guess is that since CPU GPU share the same cooling bridge in this model also have a combined overall Power Limit when one of the components overheats the system drops the TDP Max which causes everything slow down. Also maybe a side note some steps here actually decrease performance but do so in order keep it stable. I'm talking about good gaming experience here specifically regards VR. I'd rather have a stable 90fps on medium settings then getting motion sickness every 10 seconds at high settings. Anyway here's what I've done The obvious stuff 1. Get a cooling pad. Might sound stupid but it actually saves some 5 C which can be the difference for the system not pull the performance kill-switch. Totally worth the 10 bucks. 2. Clean de-dust your fans. They look filthy anyway. Just do it. The trickier stuff 3 Get a good thermal paste open up your laptop clean the old one off the CPU GPU reapply. Not gonna go into detail here there's plenty of tutorials for that on yt. Just note 're afraid of disconnecting any wires on your mainboard can lift the cooling bridge halfway up without doing that prop it up somehow can still go work like this. 4 Undervolt your CPU. This was probably still the most drastic change for me but your results may vary since how far can go the undervolt always depends on the specific CPU got. I got a stable undervolt at -0.125V that alone nets me a 15-20 C saving. Get Intel extreme tuning utility for undervolting please also read a guide on how do it before. The weird tweaks 5 Undervolt your GPU. Since GPU voltage is generally locked on laptops have use a workaround here. I used MSI Afterburner for the GPU tweaks. It has a voltage/frequency curve editor where can tell the GPU which voltage apply reach which frequency. What I've done is flattened the curve no pun intended tell the system that it's not even worth going above a specific voltage because it won't get any extra clock speeds from doing so. End result should look something like this Yes this will cut your max performance by around 400MHz. BUT it will be able hold that performance under almost any load making your FPS more stable than on most systems especially removing those nasty drops 5fps. 6 Decrease your CPU max performance. Yes we're going there. Go Windows power management settings create new power plan probably based off of the High Performance preset. Then go into advanced settings change the maximum CPU power state 60-80% - something like this sorry for the german Only I mean Only use this profile when playing GPU-heavy games eg most VR games . It drops your max CPU clock 2.2Ghz which is still enough for most games but it allows the GPU constantly run on full whack no matter what the workload. If 're doing anything else switch your regular profile. I know all of this is not a perfect solution but at that laptop's price--performance ratio I'm fine having some extra steps. Just sad I had figure all of that out on my own but hopefully it helps some of guys. GLHF! x200B So TL DR Get a cooling pad shut up do it clean your fans. Get good thermal paste open up your laptop apply on CPU GPU follow a video tutorial pls Undervolt CPU as far as stable Intel XTU also follow tutorial Get MSI Afterburner or similar modify voltage/frequency curve something like this Forces GPU run on pretty low voltage bit lower performance but consistent. Create a custom Windows power plan reduce max CPU performance 70%. Less CPU power more GPU power no more fps drops. ONLY use when playing GPU heavy games otherwise switch back default.

Sometimes when I turn off my laptop or my laptop goes sleep the HDMI will not work when I turn it back on. It will every few weeks for reasons I don't understand start working again. Then it will stop after a few days. It is driving me nuts. When it isn't working the second monitor can't be detected in display setting. Windows Key P does not help. I have done some troubleshooting know it is not my cable I have tried several they all work other laptops . It is not my display it works other laptops I have tried connecting the Nitro other displays it had the same problems I have tried different power options. I have uninstalled reinstalled the nvidia intel graphics drivers. I have gotten fed up tried a clean install of windows 10 I have tried swearing at it in three different languages. Nothing works. It just works when it wants .

Now let's get on the problem. So I own an Acer Nitro 5 Ryzen laptop for around a year now. Everything's been great it for the most part until recently. At first it started a weird popping/cracking noise when I lifted my laptop use it. It only happens when I first open it apart from that it never happens again throughout the rest of the day. That went on for a few days. Then jump cut literally today it seems like the right side of my laptop screen slightly splits apart whenever I try open the flap. Oddly enough there's absolutely no damage my laptop in terms of the way it runs. It's just that the screen splits. But from how it is right now it seems that I can pop it back in it locks...? I don't know though it looks a little worrying me. Here's how it looks like I just wanted know what should I do bout this? Should I try open up the hinge lube it up? Is it gonna be alright I just let it be until I can get a professional fix it? Should I just leave the flap open until I can actually get it fixed? Please lemme know guys. I'd get it fixed right now but malls around my area are all closed until May cause of a certain pandemic. Thanks again in advance everybody.

1,g2mdnh,AcerOfficial,4,2020/04/17 11:59:50,Morning,Looking at Aspire 3 Aspire 5 for family laptop - opinions? Looking at two options both are similarly spec'ed but I suspect the Aspire 3 may be newer? Aspire 3 Aspire 5 Both are 8GB RAM 256GB SSD 15.6 529.99. Aspire 3 has Ryzen 7 2700U RV10 integrated GPU Aspire 5 has Core i5 8265u UHD 620 integrated GPU. The Aspire 5 seems have more ports although I could probably live what the Aspire 3 offers. Google suggests that the i5 8265u is a fastebetter processor than the R7 2700u although the Vega 10 UHD 620. Free shipping on both tax on both but I can get a pretty hefty cash back offer on Acer's site the particular Aspire 3 by going through one of those rebate sites which pretty much covers tax. Your expert opinions are much appreciated!

2,g1zrzz,AcerOfficial,4,2020/04/16 12:14:25,Morning,Plethora of issues on an Acer Aspire VX5-591G Hey so. I've had this laptop for about 2 years 8 months. I've reinstalled Windows multiple times which didn't fix any of the issues I'm having. I don't expect laptops have such a short lifespan but lemme list some issues I have mine. Bluetooth completely disappearing from Windows when using for example wireless headphones. Reinstalling BT drivers doesn't help restarting doesn't help the only way get this fixed is wait for a few hours. Audio completely going out randomly. I'm listening something talking someone on Discord for example all of a sudden the whole sound goes out the sound icon in the taskbar having a red cross over it. Enabling it doesn't work again having wait although much shorter usually a few seconds . One of the most annoying things about this - what seems like packet loss goes up 100% every few minutes I can't do anything. Games cut out Discord voice cuts out after a while searching anything on the internet just brings me a No internet page. Again this didn't get fixed after reinstalling Windows. Artifacts. I'm not sure the dedicated GPU GTX 1050 Ti is dying or I'm doing something seriously wrong. I tried reinstalling drivers downgrading drivers updating the newest drivers anything but nothing helped. Every program that runs on my dedicated GPU has artifacts in a while of using be it League of Legends Photoshop Premiere Pro etc. Got a screenshot of this in both League's launcher Photoshop included in the imgur link below. I'm not exactly sure how proceed. Is this a dead GPU? Is this happening anyone else? If so fixed it how? Thanks.

I was trying solve an overheating issue some people over the internet suggested updating the BIOS the newest version in order achieve more efficient fan usage. I surfed the Acer Official Site I noticed that the choices that are given regarding my specific laptop model for the relevant downloadable files drivers bios updates etc are only destined for WIndows 7 32/64 Windows 8 32/64 OS. However since some years now I run Windows 10 on my laptop as a result of the free Win 7 Win 10 update Microsoft offered. The question is is it safe download install the latest BIOS version destined for a previous Win OS on my Win10 system not how can I update my BIOS? I would like hope that I don't have get stuck the current BIOS version V.1.07 . Thank in advance for the assistance fellow redditors tech geeks. Have a nice day all stand strong these difficult days wish all the best.

5,fx7dkd,AcerOfficial,0,2020/04/09 06:25:25,Night,Confusion VG271 I currently have the Acer Nitro VG271 P pbmiipx or whatever . My product is a little confusing since most sites state that this monitor only displays up 1080x1920 yet my monitor is able display 1440x2560 as I had the the VG271 U WQHD version . However I know I don't have the the U version since the model number on the back of my monitor matches that of the VG271 P. I've heard there's a VG271 UP which might be an in between but on newegg this monitor has a blue stand unlike the red found on the other two. The monitor is alright but has noticeable edge glow artifacts overshooting not properly calibrated. The version that I have right now is also very dim making it hard use the VRB extreme feature when playing FPS games. There is very low input lag response times but the monitor looks a little washed out no matter what color settings use. I'm not saying it's a bad monitor I'm just saying it's not for me. Once again according the model on the back of my monitor UM.HV1AA.P02 I have the VG271 pbmiipx version This monitor has a max resolution of 1080x1920 but my monitor runs 1440p just fine. Do think I got the wrong monitor? I don't have the boxes but I still have all the accesories. I got the monitor from amazon. I think the warranty was 3 year so Im pretty sure Im still in warranty period however I don't think this is applicable for return/refund. Do I need the box original packaging? I've had this monitor for a while now I'm just realizing I may have the wrong model or something else is wrong the monitor. Please help.
4,fx6k8q,AcerOfficial,14,2020/04/09 05:34:21,Night,If have a gaming model like Helios 300 'll likely be using PredatorSense control fan speeds TLDR On my Helios 300 fan speeds don't likely never ramped up max automatically. Manually maxing the fans gives a 5-15C temperature difference when gaming. Back when I got my Helios 300 I figured the fans would automatically do a good enough job at ramping up when needed that all would be fine. Regular gaming sessions would leave my CPU around 80-90C at times GPU up 75-80C a laptop cooler repaste IC Diamond 7 clean internal fans. Eventually after about 4 months the NVIDIA GPU ended up having a hardware failure after an extended gaming session thread I had send the laptop in for repairs. I'm not trying have that happen again so then I looked into PredatorSense for fan control in order see it'd help at all. I turn ColdBoost on leave it on at all times. When gaming I set the fan speed Max set the GPU overclock Turbo. When not gaming I put the fan speed back Auto but keep the GPU overclock ColdBoost enabled. With the fan speed at max my CPU GPU temps don't go past 75C so about a 5C improvement on the GPU 5-15C improvement for the CPU. I've never heard my laptop's fan as loudly as when I select Max so I'm wondering it ever ramped up max fan speeds. This is only seemingly applicable Windows. I've primarily used gamed on Linux prior this but I haven't found a way control fans or even monitor them there's no PWM control detected for fancontrol fans don't show up in lm sensors even scanning all sensors it's possible NoteBook Fan Control could be made work but no idea . When I unlocked my BIOS on this laptop previously there were fan speed control settings values shown something like fan speed 75 at 55C . I haven't experimented them also lost the BIOS unlock when I had the laptop repaired. If these fan settings work it'd theoretically get rid of dependence on PredatorSense just work on any OS I'd just max the fan speed starting around 50-60C general usage has me at 30-40C on CPU .

Disk shows up ok but for some reason I can’t seem boot from the new drive once cloned. I’ve used Hiren’s boot ISO tools mini tool partition wizard as much as the trials allowed do so. Every time it boots up back on the SD card. I did disable secure boot on the BIOS changed boot order F12’d on the WD disk.. nothing. Partition wizard shows boot partition as active etc. Since I can’t take out the embedded 64GB eMMC — as I would normally do any HDD clone how can I switch the SSD for everyday use? What I am doing wrong ? Thank !

Recently the fan started going continuously whether I am just staring at my blank Desktop or just have Microsoft World open even the laptop is cool. I dusted the fun in the hope this will be fixed but it still goes on on on like a blender... I looked this up I saw this being a 2016-ish problem but none of the fixes suggested there work most of the options there don't even appear on my laptop. My drivers have the latest updates BIOS Firmware Windows too my battery setting is on Balanced recommended the fan is set on passive tried the Active too both on battery plugged in my CPU doesn't go above 4% my GPU is about 1.2% RAM 48%. I looked in the BIOS for the Fan always on option but is nonexistent. My laptop is not compatible NitroSense apparently even though when I bought it said it is. I saw online that PredatorSesnse is basically the same thing can work for my laptop I tried install it but it has the same error as the NitroSense Sorry! This computer is not supported . What can I do? How can I stop the fan from working except when I need it? Is there any possible fix this? Please help...

After booting it runs fairly slow a simple task like opening Chrome or Chromium can take about 30s! I ran the fsc /scannow command chckdisk /f/r I also used the Disk Cleanup Disk Defragment tools. These steps have helped the speed of my laptop but it's still slow so now I am considering adding some RAM solve the problem.

For example while typing I may not be able see what I'm typing for about 10-20 seconds but when it stops being locked up it will place the text I typed in the correct order. The whole computer doesn't freeze since when it happens videos will still play games will still run. It is most annoying in video games when it locks my input the last button I pressed for that time causing me fall off of maps things. It also messes my mouse which freezes unfreezes over over causing my aim in game fly around everywhere. I don't know what's causing it since it happens both when I'm running an intensive game when I run just notepad. I haven't found anyone mentioning anything similar online but I may not have searched the correct keywords . Does anyone have any ideas on what could fix this?

2,frbaha,AcerOfficial,0,2020/03/30 11:09:09,Morning,Problems Acer Predator XB272 Monitor I just got this monitor a week ago it has 2 problems that I'm hoping someone here can help me solve Problem 1 is the display port. Some games will 'take control' of the monitor in a sense that when opened the screen goes black for a second as it's turning off will then turn on show that the display port is being used in the top right-hand corner. If I alt-tab get discord or chrome it will do the same thing will sometimes distort my entire screen. So far it has happened Minecraft Nier Automata the only way fix it has been by reinstalling the game restarting the monitor Problem 2 is a stuck pixel. Tried multiple methods try get rid of it but it's real stuck which is very distracting If anyone knows how fix these issues especially the first one I'd be very happy cause I like this monitor a lot Corona I'm not in a spot where I can go get a replacement for at least a month. Thanks! Edit Should prob list my core specs whoops that could help. AMD Ryzen 5 3600 Nvidia RTX 2060 Super 16gb DDR4 3200 ram

I think the problem is the hard drive but I'm unsure wondering anyone has come across the problem before. The laptop never gets past the initial Acer screen during its boot-up. When I connect the drive another machine it shows the disk partitions however when I try enter them it then crashes windows explorer the device is no longer visible. I tried the windows disk format try wipe the drive however it also crashed when trying perform this action. This occurs every time I try both options. I cannot enter the boot menu or bios when I load up the laptop either. Anybody any advice on how fix this or how format the hard drive start again this is the case I will need find my windows key for the device any help on that would be appreciated too as I no longer have the box .

2,fqi7vs,AcerOfficial,14,2020/03/29 03:11:39,Night,Helios 300 higher FPS on external display I have an Acer Helios 300 2019 version a gtx 1660ti. My fps for most games were a bit lower than other benchmarks on youtube. On gta5 I was getting about 15% lower than others so I didnt think much about it. But on rainbow six siege I am getting much lower FPS. While others got 144fps on ultra settings I'm getting just 100 fps on low graphic settings. Even in other games like Assassins Creed Unity my fps is about 30% lower than others. When I connected an external display through the HDMI port I got the same FPS that other benchmarks on youtube got. But on the laptop display the FPS is about half on rainbow six siege. Here is my video gameplay on external display laptop display. on laptop display external display I have reinstalled windows don't have any unnecessary junk except MSI afterburner steam. I took the recording on the external display right after that on the laptop display too. There are no other variables other than the addition of the external display. From what I understand the HDMI port is directly connected the Nvidia GPU but the laptop display is connected the intel GPU. So while gaming on the laptop display the Nvidia GPU has send frames through the Intel GPU. However benchmarks my exact same config are getting 170 FPS on the laptop display itself. How can I fix this?
2,fq87u5,AcerOfficial,1,2020/03/28 15:13:28,Afternoon,Battery life Hi there! So I have an acer predator helios 300 2019 laptop rtx 2060 video card I noticed that even while it's plugged in the battery level kept decreasing while I played game on it or the turbo mode was on. Is this normal? Or it's the power brick or battery or something else? My second question is that even when I bought the laptop last year the battery life was low when I unplugged it. It's the same low as it was before. If it's unplugged I only watch movies listening some music wifi still on my battery life decrease 40% in 1 5 hours when I unplug it the battery life doesn't even start from 100% it decrease from 96%. What could be the problem? I will appreciate all of your help. Thanks a lot!

Is it malicious or legitimately from acer? 2 screenshots of the window It claims be Acer User Experience Improve Program but I looked it up it's actually Improvement . My laptop is also fairly new I got it on September 2019. So this seems like something that shows up only when setting up one for the first time not when it's already been in use for months. I haven't clicked anything on it am not planning until I figure out this is really harmless.
1,fq5p2w,AcerOfficial,2,2020/03/28 13:03:20,Afternoon,Acer Aspire E5 - 8.0GB Ram installed 3.2 usable  Hi all I am getting that message in my system properties. Even though the laptop ships 8GB of RAM confirmed in the BIOS only 3.2 are usable within Windows. That is less than half makes quite a difference in performance. In all likelyhood this is related the onboard GPU Radeon R6 which is sharing some of the built in memory. However since this device has a dedicated graphics card dedicated memory I don't really have a need for the onboard one. Now normally this would be something change on the advanced tab in BIOS. I've done so many times on a number of devices. However for this model the advanced tab of BIOS appears be be something of a myth. Half the people swear it exists other say it doesn't. If there is indeed no advanced BIOS how can I tell the system not allocate any memory the onboard graphics card? Thanks for any advice!

2,fovzal,AcerOfficial,1,2020/03/26 11:01:09,Morning,Download speed on Nitro 5 a lot lesser than other laptops connected the same Wifi Guys I have an Acer nitro 5 AN515-54-58BA. I just got it yesterday I’ve been trying download games from steam uplay. The download speeds I’m getting are about half of what others on my same network get. The variant I have comes Intel R Wi-Fi 6 AX200 160MHZ WiFi card. Not a Qualcomm one like most nitro 5’s . I tried updating the wifi card drivers rebooting. I tried uninstalling useless apps including the antivirus but still there is no improvement in the speeds. Before this i had a dell laptop which had the same problem. But the solution was simply uninstall this app called smartbyte that came preloaded the system. Then the wifi speeds shot up. Is there any app like that which is bottlenecking my download speed that I should delete? Could someone help me out here? I would be very grateful. Any suggestions are welcome. 🙏🏼

On Sunday I called in have a shipping label emailed me due a broken laptop was told that the label had be approved. I wait until Tuesday check my email no label so I call in find out what on Earth is taking so long approve a shipping label have been on hold for the last hour... An hour long hold isn't acceptable. I still have other things do today which require the usage of my phone... EDIT after an hour the line said there was a problem connecting my call try again later. This is 100% unacceptable. Acer sold me a busted laptop your support agent screwed up now your phone system has wasted an hour of my time. If this continues I will start billing Acer for my time 20/hr CAD as this issue shouldn't have happened on several fronts only I have keep investing large chunks of time into fixing this issue . With the outbreak the answer isn't cut down on support staff hours it's get them working from home.
2,foozjc,AcerOfficial,9,2020/03/26 03:51:14,Night,Helios 300 stuttering low fps. I have an Acer Helios 300 2019 version a gtx 1660ti. My fps for most games were a bit lower than other benchmarks on youtube. On gta5 I was getting about 15% lower than others so I didnt think much about it. But on rainbow six siege I am getting much lower FPS. While others got 144fps on ultra settings I'm getting just 100 fps on low graphic settings. Even in other games like Assassins Creed Unity my fps is about 30% lower than others. Also recently I started getting fps stuttering while playing these are the results using MSI afterburner As can see whenever there is a FPS drop/stutter the intel gpu usage increases nvidia gpu usage decreases. I have done a DDU updated both nvidia intel display drivers but I still have this problem. I have seleced High Performance Nvidia Processor in Nvidia settings too but still the issue persists. I think it might be an issue of nvidia optimus but I have tried fixing it by selecting nvidia gpu in the nvidia settings fps is still low. What else can I do fix this issue? Edit1 I think its something do nvidia optimus. I used an external monitor which is directly connected the GPU I had no stuttering also had better FPS. From what I understand the laptop display is connected the intel GPU the nvidia GPU has send frames through the intel one. I think there is some problem here as using the nvidia GPU connected directly the external display has better performance than the laptop display connected the Intel GPU. I have enabled the nvidia gpu as the preferred GPU in the nvidia control panel. Update I have reinstalled windows cleaned the fans today but the FPS is still the same. Here is a video of my gameplay the CPU GPU usage at are the top corner

5,fms9kh,AcerOfficial,5,2020/03/22 18:31:09,Afternoon,Bought an Acer Nitro 5. Very disappointed. This thing has been nothing but issues. At 1st it was wonderful but after 2 or 3 weeks the CPU fan started groaning not reaching proper RPMs then the CPU fan stopped working most of the time very rare instances where it would start groaning again. Next came the keyboard...half of it stopped working. Luckily the power button still worked however. Then the mouse pad stopped working when the laptop would start up I'd get a picture of a hand pointing at a touch pad a cancel sign. And then today I close my laptop lid take a nap when I wake up the power button no longer works rendering the entire laptop unworkable. I would have sent it in earlier had talked support but they had quoted me a 4 week turn around time which interferes University but now this world situation I now begrudgingly have time send it in...though I still use my laptop as everything from my tv my gaming console.

Recently I’ve been using ethernet for about half a year already because Ive had a wifi problem since around a year ago. I recently had move a different place in my house for gaming so I decided move back wifi while being naive about my wifi problem. After researching on my wireless card which is an Intel Wireless AC 9560 Ive had no matching results my wifi problem. The wifi problem is that whenever I connect wifi it will disconnect for a split second anytime it wants reconnect. It doesn’t show that it disconnects shows that it was on wifi the whole time. This makes gaming a serious problem for me since I will usually get kicked for disconnecting even when it shows it have not. I’ve looked into device manager disable the save power mode no smps. Back in 2018 when this laptop was new I had no issues whatsoever so I was think it might have do an update because I kept this laptop in ‘like-new’ condition. I’ve done almost everything I could other than it being a hardware issue. It seems like everyone has the Qualcomm Atheros wireless card driver instead because their Nitro 5 is a different variant. Going back the update issue I’m not totally sure windows updates has do this since windows does funky stuff your computer driver sometimes that I didn’t keep track this problem persisted after an update. But anyway I can’t connect ethernet which is a big downside i cant connect a stable wifi connection which is just a terrible experience overall. I also won’t be taking this laptop back for repairs needed as I don’t have the time nor money. But anyway please help can thank .

Also should I consider just straight up disabling my intel graphics in the device manager? Would there be any downsides.

I have Acer 5750G before doing a clean reinstall from a CD not the Acer backup recovery CDs I made but a pure Win 7 64-bit CD I had two recovery partitions that came the laptop - a 17GB partition labelled OEM or Acer Recovery I'm not sure 100MB PQService. Backstory The PQService partition had been formatted before doing the reinstall because an IT professional said it might conflict after doing a clean reinstall because it might be there twice aftwer it although I was doubtful since it worked fine when I tried it before said that it's not related the Acer recovery partition when I said what it's needed so he formatted it. Everything seemed fine but after doing the reinstall I found out that all the Acer recovery functions don't work. The issue When I boot into the recovery menu I only get the regular Win 7 recovery menu not the Acer one I can't even install the recovery app from the application backup CD it's there because it doesn't load - it just keeps spinning in the drive I see the CD in the file manager but can't open it. I still have my 4 backup Acer CDs so I could try booting them doing another reinstall however I'd prefer it I could somehow restore the partition it's still there using some software retrieval or reinstalling somehow. Is it possible? Is there a way recover the PQService partition since I tried not using the laptop much? Or a way reinstall it? I still have the 3GB OEM folder that was in C / backed up Testdisk shows that the 17GB OEM/recovery partition is still there intact is actually called PQService in testdisk which makes me wonder how was the 100MB partition named in testdisk then . There's also 100MB system reserved partition which I think replaced the previous PQSERVICE although it was always 100MB large. I originally accidentally triple posted then deleted all three threads.

Should I try upgrading the RAM or the graphics card? Is that even possible? How would I go about that?

On my Helios 300 it seems like my NVIDIA dGPU has a hardware issue thread The laptop is in-warranty Acer sent me instructions send the laptop in. I opened the laptop in order replace the thermal paste a while back. The temperatures after this were improved I'm confident it isn't the cause of my GPU issues. But I'm wondering Acer will see it that way or would they blame me for the GPU being damaged? it's in the linked thread but the GPU basically became unstable during a graphically-intense gaming session . It'll cost me a good bit ship the laptop them US shipping Texas I'd just like gauge I should ship it them expecting the GPU issue be fixed under warranty or they'll claim I did the damage charge me for it. If they charge me for the repair I'd also wonder what the cost would be but I'm afraid I wouldn't be able afford it in which case I'd have wasted my time money shipping the laptop them start . Edit Sent it in so I guess I'll find out report how it goes.

My Acer Aspire vn7-792g makes worrying noises after being used for some time. I know everyone's first guess is the fan but I've triple checked it I really don't think it's the fan. The first noise is what I'd describe as rather quiet noninvasive buzzing. It can be managed for instance when I shut down some apps software it tends dissappear. But the second noise the crackling is loud scary. The laptop works great temperatures are great I also have a cooling pad no throttling no issues. Except for the noises. The noises seem originate from this place x200B That's where they are by far the loudest. So my question is what is this component right there could it be causing the noises? If so how fix this? Thank in advance for any suggestions. Cheers!

I had replace my AC adapter late last fall shortly after that the battery started giving me trouble. It charges up 100% as it hits 100 it disconnects the power supply switches battery. For a split second the charge lists at around 95% then jumps 99% then hits 100 only disconnect again. This takes no longer than 15 seconds per cycle often more like 10 seconds. I play WoW. This used only happen when I was playing WoW even then only intermittently. I wondered it was a software issue. But now it happens when I'm just running Chrome. As can imagine it's pretty annoying when 're trying play a game your screen darkens lightens that often. Obviously I've tried a restart. The battery settings are set Balanced. Turn Off Display is set at 5 minutes Battery 10 minutes Power Supply. Sleep is at 15 each. Is it the adapter? This didn't start immediately after it was replaced but it only happened while gaming once it started. Is it the battery? The machine was bought in March 2018. Thanks very kindly for any help.

I don't need repair I only need advice regarding the preservation the power supply problem. I'll try do everything by myself. And by the way can someone tell me where is the RAM hatch? I just found 2 GB of ram in a old Samsung laptop my dad had. I upgrade the memory 2 gigs. Any ideas?

1,f9chgy,AcerOfficial,0,2020/02/26 08:07:24,Morning,Aspire One ZG5 AOA150 I was overjoyed see an available upgrade for my ol‘ reliable a mini-pcie video decodeaccelerator. In my blissful state I ordered it on a moment‘s notice it‘s on route. Excitement galore I opened the easy access port just below the battery in anticipation. To find the mini-pcie port missing. Yeah there are holes for the connector settle circuits ready it‘s simply not there. In my defense I never felt the need look the connector was there. Anyway main question I plan remove the wireless pcie card that’s occupying the internal/lower pcie slot plugging the video card in there. I will buy a nano wifi dongle for connectivity purposes. Are there any compatibility/connectivity issues that I should be aware of? Will it work? Has anyone done this?

5,f8egnd,AcerOfficial,0,2020/02/24 11:33:56,Morning,Heads up Swift 5 Swift 3 models Ice Lake CPU received drastically lowered RAM speed due BSOD issue I just bought a Swift 5 SF514-54GT. It's nice overall seems work fine. However I noticed the memory runs at 2660 MHz at pretty horrific 24-24-24-56-1T timings. This is reported by both HWiNFO AIDA64. The measured read bandwidth AIDA64 is 38 GB/s compared around 54 GB/s on a Surface Laptop. Latency fairs a bit better at 101 ns vs 93 ns. The memory chips in this laptop are actually high-spec SK Hynix LPDDR4X-4266 should be running at 3733 MHz maximum supported by the CPU the design was working as intended. It seems some sort of hardware issue meant they had back off the clocks considerably losing around 30% of the memory bandwidth. The first officially release BIOS for this model actually has the following description on Acer's site Disable Memory configure of SAGV for MFG BSOD issue So it appears they had disable the System Agent dynamic memory clocking due getting blue screens of death. The same issue seems exist on at least Swift 3 as well. Just thought I'd mention this here since it's nice at least know of it before spending the money. The computer seems perform fine although slightly lower in a few tests when compared benchmarks of other models. My particular model has an MX 250 GPU dedicated GDDR5 so I'm less reliant on high memory bandwidth. Models only the integrated graphics might be more negatively affected when running graphics heavy content. If anyone from Acer would happen read this Do have any comments? Any possibility of getting a better solution than this pretty drastic one?

I got a windows update which it said unable complete update brought me back the loadup screen. Well I thought this was just a forced windows update of some strange kind so I checked for updates there were some apparently so I did all that. And then AGAIN it happened..... Was playing another game about an hour later it just black screened the predator logo boot up just brought me back the login screen instead of a windows update. Did anyone ever have issues their predator doing this? I can only think of it being a cpu or overheating problem... I don't turn the turbo mode on when playing since the cpu temperature is around 60 during League since it doesn't seem like I'd have . I do have a logitech keyboard ontop of the laptop so I can think that might be it but this is extremely frustrating...

1,f73atu,AcerOfficial,3,2020/02/21 17:11:24,Afternoon,Newly purchased Acer Predator 27 XB273K Displayport not working So I've tried basically everything I can think of. I turned the monitor on off changes settings taken the cord out tried it different computers different cables different ports in the computer I even tried reinstalling the graphics drivers. It should be noted that the hdmi port worked just fine so there's a precedent for it functioning. Just that one displayport that seems screwy. Is there something obvious i'm missing? Some kind of firmware update bios nonsense? I'm willing try anything at this point. Not sure this is an issue anyone else has had this model before so I thought I might as well try here for a solution before I use the warranty get a replacement. Any help offered is appreciated.

But I take the back off push the hard drive in it works. So I'm assuming the part that the hard drive goes into is kind of loose. Should I replace that part? Also I have no idea what name for it is. Issue 2. I've switched hard drives it seems work a few times but then continues happening. Is it possible it's my motherboard ? If need anymore info try help me feel free message me or reply! I still have all the original stickers on the back of the laptop that helps anything . I'm assuming it's hardware because mostly everything works except being able power on without getting stuck in a boot loop Thank guys in advance! Edited for typos!

Worked great for a little while but after a Windows update at one point it started crash constantly. BSODs various causes listed. Rolling back the update didn't seem help after a while it crashed enough that it had repair the OS. By now I've spent more time resetting it or reinstalling Windows than I have using it. Acer support told me eat it. So... maybe someone has some advice? The cause of the issue appears be the Intel display drivers. It took a while narrow it down but I've found that it doesn't crash I remove the Intel drivers block them from reinstalling. Or at least it seems like it's stable in that configuration. Unfortunately it's stuck using the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter. I've tried the old drivers from Acer's site the new ones from Intel various other ones of different vintages that I was able find but it seems that any version of the Intel display driver causes the crashing return. The recovery partition seems have gotten screwed in one of the wipes because I can't boot that. I don't have recovery media because I'm a dumbass didn't think it was important. You can't download an image of the original install I don't really shell out the 50 get one from Acer because I strongly suspect that it'll just happen again as soon as Windows updates. I can live the Microsoft display adapter as long as that's a viable option. I can't find a lot of details about it except everyone saying not use it or telling how get rid of it by installing the right drivers. Anyone have any thoughts or experience in this area? Am I asking for trouble in some way using the basic adapter? Any way avoid crashes the Intel drivers? Any other options?

This does not appear happen when Freesync is disabled via Radeon Adrenalin settings. I have tried reinstalling updating display drivers from AMD no fix. I tried installing the latest display drivers from Acer no fix. I have tried different HDMI cables no fix. I have tried different HDMI ports on the GPU the monitor no fix. I don't have a DP cable test it . I have not yet messed programs like CRU. I'm thinking about reinstalling Windows just eliminate the possibility of it being a software issue. I have it set 120 Mhz for browsing/desktop use where I have no issues. When I'm playing a game I usually try limit FPS 60. I thought that maybe it was related the FPS dropping below the Freesync range 48-144 but it seems happen even at a steady 60 FPS. I thought maybe it was related enhanced sync being enabled but it happens whether enhanced sync is on or off.

1,ez4mj3,AcerOfficial,0,2020/02/05 21:42:32,Evening,Switch Alpha 12 stylus? Hello fellow redditors! I currently own a Switch Alpha 12 I was buying it primarily take handwritten notes on OneNote at school during lectures. However I did not check the availability of the stylus before buying the computer. I checked on Acer's website it seems that there is only one of their styluses that is compatible the SA12 I did read correctly. I did not find any retailer near me or online that had an original Acer stylus. I did buy an aftermarket stylus that relies on the touch screen but more often than not it lags flings everywhere does not have palm rejection. So my question is this is there any other alternative the original stylus that apparently isn't sold anymore apparently? Thank y'all have a good one! D

5,exp0ms,AcerOfficial,1,2020/02/03 06:17:07,Night,Laptop taking almost 2 minutes boot from shutdown hibernation but restart is taking only seconds. Windows 10 As the title says My laptop is acting strange. Model Acer Aspire E5-575 i3-6100U Windows 10 Pro - 1909 It has a normal hard disk. I upgraded an SSD upped the ram from 4 12. After this the problem started. The system is smooth after the upgrade but the startup time just got tripled except for the restart. Don't know the problem is SSD or the extra 8 GB ram I installed. The thing is the SSD is not a normal laptop SSD It's SanDisk CloudSpeed Ultra Gen II SDLF1CRM-016T 1.6TB SATA SSD Enterprise Multi-Level Cell Read-Intensive 1.8-DWPD Serial ATA Solid State Disk Drive the RAM as per CPU-Z Slot 1 DDR4-2134 1067 MHz 4096 MBytes Slot 3 DDR4-2400 1200 MHz 8192 MBytes When this slow booting occurs the system usually stuck at the Acer logo for almost 2 minutes then it will show the login screen.

9,exkcah,AcerOfficial,0,2020/02/02 22:30:42,Evening,So ThrottleStop is a must for latest Predator Helios I've purchased Predator Helios 300 w/ RTX2060 recently the system was reaching 90 C for witcher 3 in High Ultra settings though it's a bit normal for i9750H it's not good for cpu life. Then tried ThrottleStop power cpu at 130 now the game is not even touching 75 C. Shows that the power supply cpu is by default set be higher maybe for better performance. This is something that acer should look into. It'd be better they provide a software for this.

2,esgrtl,AcerOfficial,2,2020/01/23 11:25:03,Morning,Acer Nitro 5 AN515-54-75UQ w/ Core™ overheating? Maybe? Hey there guys! In November I purchased my first gaming laptop. Full disclosure I am not very education on computers. I work in Automotive that is where my strengths are so please bear me! Here are the specs of said laptop Intel Core™ i7-9750H processor 2.60GHz Hexa-Core NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR5 15.6 Full HD 1 920 x 1 080 IPS display w/ ComfyView Technology 16GB DDR4 SDRAM 512GB SSD storage Windows 10 Home 64-bit HDMI USB 3.1 Type-C™ USB 3.1 Type A USB 2.0 ports connectivities I have one of those MonitoLaptop stands from Amazon. Has many holes for cooling. The only game I currently play on it is Rust which can easily be 2 hours 10 hours of constant gaming. I noticed that at odd times the game would lag slightly not exactly what I wanted experience on my pricey purchase. I opened NitroSense view my CPU GPU temperatures. I can't remember exactly what the GPU was but I think it was in the high 60 F range. Don't quote me on that. However my CPU temperature reached 95 F. It wasn't currently at 95 F I just saw that was the high score ? for the day on my laptop I keep an eye on my NitroSense gauges when playing when its constantly reaching mid 90's I turn Max Fan on. 8/10 times temperature goes down significantly others it will still stay in the lower 90 I adjusted some settings on the NitroSense such as turning on CoolBoost is on HighPerformance. I have found the Max temperature on the CPU be pushing 100 F it may have even reached that high. I called Memory Express I opted out of their in house warranty I might be slightly regretting it spoke a tech that said it sounds like it might be getting a little hot but the best bet would be bring it into them they would ship it Acer they would diagnose it from there. x200B I am curious that is normal operating temperatures for a laptop running Rust? Should I send my laptop into Acer ensure it is operating as designed? Is there something I am doing wrong? x200B TL DR Laptop runs at 95 F - 100 F playing Rust. Unsure that is proper operating temperature of a game like that. Have turn on MaxFan sometimes.

Portrait mode works fine but landscape is always wrong side up even while the tablet is connected the keyboard. If I rotate the orientation manually Ctrl Alt Arrow Up it stays correct until I switch programs. As soon as the current window isn't focussed any more e.g. pressing Alt Tab clicking on the task bar switching from the browser Word it reverts again. Using Rotation Lock is a workaround but it's kind of a hassle have keep activating deactivating it. I didin'tchange any options since yesterday updates weren't installed either as far as I know. I have already tried restarting the system manually setting the orientation in the windows setting activating deactivating Rotation Lock switching tablet mode On off disconnecting reconnecting the tablet from the keyboard.

2,er71br,AcerOfficial,0,2020/01/20 19:07:41,Evening,Acer XF270H Colors are terrible.... The issue who's color's are they The fix. The Short answer - Its not Acer's colors that are messed up... Agreed... Colors are not good upon initial setup on Windows 10 build 191206-1406. So like most of who have stumbled here looking for a solution I stumbled through many a web page... In my search I did notice something consistent. Anyone who had installed the monitor under Ubuntu or other Linux distribution didn't have a problem until they used the monitor on Windows... By default there is no Windows Acer driver for the XF270H so Windows uses - Generic PNP monitor - as the driver perfectly acceptable . Except Windows uses it own .icc file determine colors not Acer's. Therefore it's Windows colors that are messed up not Acer's. The Fix Install Acer's .icc color pallet configuration file. How Summary 1. Download Driver for XF270H 2. Extract file find Acer XF270H A.icm 3. In Windows 10 type Color Management in the Box 4. Go Devices - confirm are looking at the correct monitor then check the box Use my settings for this device click add at the bottom of that page Browse where extracted the downloaded Acer driver double click on the .icm file there is only one click OK or maybe just close. I recommend restarting your system. Detail Go Acer Support page for the XF270H try this link download the drivers file... I know above I just said there is no Acer driver - well it is not an installable driver but some some configuration files listed under the heading Drivers. Place the file downloaded into a new/empty folder as the file is compressed needs be extracted. Go into Windows File Manager - Extract the file by double clicking on it ONLY after have placed it in a new folder by itself. The file Acer XF270H A.icm is the file will need. Follow the instruction from Windows Central .com in the following link. Once open this link page down about 6 or 7 times until find How install color profile for your monitor

2,eppc4a,AcerOfficial,2,2020/01/17 12:47:56,Morning,Acer Aspire E 15 ES1-512-C5YW touchpad not working after updating driver Windows 10  Hi everyone I hope 're all having a nice day I recently inherited this laptop from a family member who unfortunately passed away have been having a couple of issues the touchpad Elantech . I had reset the laptop because no one knew the login info for it I wasn't too bothered about losing the data set it up as new. When it was set up all seemed be working fine except for the fact that the scroll function on the touchpad wasn't working. After doing some research I found out that it could either be because the touchpad was set basic in the BIOS menu or because the driver was out of date. The first thing I did was change the touchpad setting advanced in the BIOS menu after which it was still working. Then I updated the driver version 13.6.3.1 which apparently was successful so I restarted the laptop however when I attempted use the touchpad it's now totally unresponsive. When I try check the device manager it only shows the USB mouse I'm now having use when I check the Hardware tab in Settings Devices Mouse Touchpad Additional Mouse Options it again only shows the USB mouse. When I select the Elantech tab everything is greyed out however it says that the driver there is a different version the one I installed 11.15.0.18 X64 . So I don't really understand what's happened. Any help would be extremely appreciated as I can't seem find anything on the internet that matches my issue most of the questions posts that I can find are from people that have updated the whole OS not just the touchpad driver. Thanks in advance for your help

4,eogeej,AcerOfficial,2,2020/01/14 20:40:20,Evening,A couple questions about the Aspire E E5-575-52jf I have a friend one of these laptops. She thought it was beyond repair because of a charger battery issues. I found a replacement charger for her online no problem. But I'm having a difficult time sourcing a replaceable battery. I'd like know all E5-575 batteries are compatible. I wish I could look at her battery compare what I've found online but unfortunately a technician looked at the laptop previously removed it. In the online listings I never see the specific model number listed 52JF . But one of the sites did state they're all compatible. Separate from this I'd like know what ram is compatible this laptop. I found some on Amazon but it was literally 3 sticks which I found underwhelming. On the topic of upgrades I'd like her get an SSD place the HD in a CD caddy. I've no idea all cd caddies are universal though again which would work this laptop. I'd be very appreciative of any help that can be given.

My Aspire E1-571 when plugged in shows the battery as charging for 14 seconds then not for 9 seconds then charging for 14 seconds so on. The charger powers the laptop fine when the battery is removed as it is such a consistent cycle I think it is a software fault. I have tried uninstalling the battery from device manager which briefly fixed the issue when it was re-installed but it's still happening. Is there anything else I can try fix it? I am using a third-party battery charger originals died laptop is 7 years old so I'm well aware they could be the issue. Finally I can't fix it is there anyway disable the system beep that plays when the charger is plugged in or unplugged? I could deal the inconsistent charging it was silent! There's no option I can see in the sound settings or in the BIOS options. Thanks.

Hes dropped a glass of water over it waited for 2 or 3 then checked its still working. He said he could still boot into BIOS so i took it see i could repair it. I checked for any water stains inside but there were nothing. Only the HDD died. So i replaced it installed Ubuntu Windows 10 checked for any problem. Anything works except for one thing the trackpad behaves pretty strange on Windows 10. On Ubuntu every works fine i can scroll 2 fingers sensetivety clicking is fine. On Windows 10 the movement is pretty bad i can't scroll 2 fingers... i installed the Synaptic driver from acer.com reboot then uninstalled installed the ELANTECH reboot but still nothing is working.. I'd go for a faulty touchpad but since it's working fine on Ubuntu i can't explain whats wrong it... I installed Windows 10 through a flash drive. Anyone had the same problem or maybe knows what else i could try x200B x200B Edit i solved the problem faster than i expected! Uninstalled all driver for the touchpad went the BIOS there was actually an option where can set the touchpad custom. The reboot into windows 10 wait for the new driver be installed.

When I plug in wired headphone the audio driver does not switch Headphone mode but stick Speaker mode. This means I can't use Dolby Atmos or Windows Sonic spatial sound in my games. Strangely my BT AKG headphone was able trigger these modes. And it's a huge difference during FPS games. So would really love use spatial sound my wired cans. 2. The specs say it comes RGB keyboard. Heck there is even a sticker on the laptop that it comes 4 zone RGB. Yet I don't see the lighting module in Predator Sense. Only Blue backlight is available. Btw the 120hz color coverage is really bad though brightness is acceptable. Otherwise the performance is really impressive! Thanks for the advice in advance L64.

I paired it a Surfacebook 2 which had a GTX 1060. I am not quite sure GTX1060 supports freesync so I manually turned off freesync through the monitor settings. However I occasionally encountered flickering as the video clip shown. x200B Once the monitor starts flickering I can't access the monitor's setting there's no menu showing up even I unplug the HDMI the monitor is still flickering whatever my laptop is displaying right before I unplug the HDMI. I wonder this is a defective unit or this flickering issue is purely due the incompatible Nvdia cards. Thanks in advance.

I replaced my laptop battery HDD SSD myself a couple of months ago. Shortly after whenever I was less than 100% then tried plug in my charger the battery stutters - my laptop moves from battery mode plugged in mode intermittently multiple times within seconds. Interestingly as soon as the laptop sleeps the laptop charges well. If it's full blue light I can then open my laptop use it plugged in or not plugged in . The only issue is I'm less than full-charge I try plugging it in. Summary Laptop works when 100% battery plugged in it is on battery Laptop doesn't work when 100% battery I then plug it in. Extra info - Bought the laptop August 2014 I'd like another 2-4 years - Body is 6/10 - Not using official battery or charger. Battery from LaptopCharge Sep 2019 . AC Adapter's older - about 3 years. - Second time I'm replacing battery - dies within 2 years where I can only use it in AC mode.

Is it most likely that I didn't install them correctly? I'm not sure why only one's popping up. Currently I got Disk 0 which is the C drive that came the laptop. Disk 1 unallocated space is either one of the two new SSDs I just installed. But there should be a third Disk that should pop up but it's not showing. Anyone else experience this? Is it again most likely that I didn't properly install either one of the two drives? EDIT I disconnected my samsung 2.5 ssd now both new drives are not showing up. So the problem seems be the NVMe M.2 drive that I just installed.

Sometimes it would suddenly shut down out of the blue like it had no power even when in charge. Hdmi port stopped working after a while. It’s made of cheap plastic basically screen frame broke easily. Ethernet is maxed out at 480mbps USB2 speed . SD card reader doesn’t work at all Linux. Acer official support only supports windows related questions. When asked how reset the bios how delete uefi entries I had no response whatsoever. They pointed me contact a local authorized repair center for resetting bios? Ridiculous . Also nvidia video card does not play nice Linux. I had change the whole mainboard so I had the second ram slot HDMI working finally. Upgraded ram 16G which is the maximum amount of memory supported . I upgraded the wifi card an Intel wifi ac Bluetooth model. I had apply tape a pin in order make Bluetooth work stabilize wifi. I upgraded the stock 1TB 5400rpm hard disk an ssd. I removed the optical media drive added a second ssd the help of an adapter. I obviously installed Linux using the first ssd for / partition the second ssd for /home partition. I moved /var /tmp tmpfs ram drive . After all that it is fairly usable but it keeps on slowly disintegrating due the very cheap plastic it is made of. Still I can’t make use of the SD Card slot in any way STILL I do not know how reset the bios or delete uefi entries. In conclusion due myself being a Linux-only user expecting a decent quality product support I would not buy acer products ever again.

3,ecg1il,AcerOfficial,3,2019/12/19 09:57:45,Morning,Different part numbers for XV272u I have a xv272u that I bought in June of this year. I currently have this monitor 1080p as a secondary I've been considering upgrading an additional 1440p monitor. I'm considering another Acer monitor but am weighing my options. While researching I came across something a little odd wanted see others have run into this. nbsp It seems that there are two different part numbers for the same model but I can't find any differences. Additionally my monitor says it has a particular part number but when I search by SNID on the acer support page a monitor a different part number shows up. It could just be a weird way that they label their monitors but struck me as odd so I wanted see others had more information/similar questions. nbsp Two different part numbers for same monitor I have found XV272u UM.HX2AA.P03 nbsp XV272u MM.TFBAA.001 nbsp The back of my monitor says it is part number UM.HX2AA.P03 but when I search on the Acer support site I'm brought the other part number model. nbsp Anyone else ran into this same thing or know why this might be?

But there are several things I was unable find on the internet there is a lack of real technical reviews of the Acer Swift 5 2019 edition.. x200B Is the SSD removable/upgradable ? I live in fear of SSD failures past the warranty period How many fans are there ? With an i7 a dedicated GPU I don't think 1 fan is going be enough in the long run. Is the USB-C Thunderbolt 3 4 lanes ? x200B Overall would recommend it ?

Hmmm.... Even though I am told the issue has been going on for weeks /months. Even this is true would have been helpful let the customer know the actual situation rather than wasting time contacting banks checking on other potential causes. 2 after learning of the above using a Mastercard Debit also ends in a payment rejection but this time the rejected order is not listed in my accounts recent orders the Acer customer rep cannot see any trace of me attempting it even though I received an email stating the order didn't go through 3 after again calling Acer support the advice then is use PayPal This is almost laughable 😂

It said a problem occurred that it was cancelled but now windows login screen won’t come up. I’m able bring up the menu Alt F10 I went back read it the caption says “delete everything” is for when recycle the computer. Did I just destroy my laptop? cringe not any ideas as what I can do?

2,e4mjw2,AcerOfficial,6,2019/12/02 11:48:57,Morning,Issues the ED273 Hi all I bought the ED273 Monitor off of Amazon about a year ago. It's had some issues here there brightness flickering as seen in this review My issue was far more apparent than the review but seems be lessened now that I have a new DP cable a fresh install of Windows. I've heard the problem arises when a non-144hz monitor is plugged in so I'm afraid of plugging in my 60hz auxiliary monitor. This issue has been apparent since the original purchase but only got worse a month ago near constant brightness changes in all corners . Using a 1080 the monitor is gsync compatible so I thought this was going be a good purchase. The Acer Display Widget doesn't appear work this monitor. All right but one reviewer appears have it working. I left a message for them a long time ago didn't expect hear back. I then went Acer Support they said the monitor was not supported. I checked the reviewer the other day they said it worked after updating GPU drivers which still did not work for me. The customer support is largely unhelpful is clearly struggling understand the things I say. I'll explain problems in detail the regular response is turn the monitor off/on again or use a different cable after which they say they can't help any further. Using the warranty means I have pay for shipping this is a large fragile device so shipping would be understandably expensive. This is coming off terribly ranty but I'm just not impressed the product the level of service from Acer. Has anyone here run into these issues happens know workarounds?

When I have it plugged in the orange light comes on saying it's charging when I press the power button the blue light comes on which means it's on. However the light stays on for about 30 seconds the laptop sounds like it's turning on but nothing is happening on the screen then after 30 seconds it shuts off does the same thing over over again. This laptop is almost 5 years old. Any solutions on how possibly fix this issue? Thanks!
2,e3ej96,AcerOfficial,3,2019/11/30 05:08:39,Night,If I get my key board fixed will my computer retain it's data? My computer an Acer Aspire 5 stopped turning on. It just shut down out of nowhere while it'll charge the on button won't work. I had somebody look at it said it might be the keyboard. Since I've only had the computer for a few months the warranty get it fixed should still be good. I f I do get it fixed will it wipe out the data or should it be good? I'm not big on the idea of backing up a few months of data for a couple hundred dollars unless I need . Thanks for reading have a nice day.
3,e39c70,AcerOfficial,4,2019/11/29 19:58:18,Evening,Accessing advanced/unrestricted BIOS settings consistently? I've heard reports of people certain Acer laptops being able sometimes gain access an unrestricted BIOS settings menu. Some speculate can hold a key or combination down at some point while others have had it triggered randomly. One person claimed it happened after they connected a new HDD but only once after the first boot. It would likely vary depending on the laptop model but does Acer have any actual instructions or support official or unofficial for this for any of their laptops or desktops?

7,e2vzgc,AcerOfficial,10,2019/11/29 01:54:25,Night,Whats the point of not putting the HDD into the laptop putting it in the box separately? I am so angry. Literally bought a laptop that was advertised as having 1 TB HDD. And I don't have it. I only have the HDD upgrade cable. I assume its because they literally farm money from customers like me who buy a laptop AS ADVERTISED. I am so done buying anything from the US. You buy anything it always comes some absolutely ridiculous stuff that would never happen in Europe. I have an Acer Nitro 7. How do I upgrade my HDD eithout losing warranty? There are no Acer Service Centres in my area.

4,e28b1i,AcerOfficial,1,2019/11/27 17:25:04,Afternoon,Acer Predator xb271h hell Hey guys. I have an Acer Predator XB271h monitor that I think crapped out on me yesterday. In the middle of a game the screen went white won’t show so much as the built in menu. When it went white I still had game audio could interact the game. I’ve tried a second monitor my pc it worked fine. Unplugging everything from the monitor but the power cable still only shows a white screen. I’ve scoured Acer forums YouTube Google for any other information I could find. The monitor is only 13 months old from purchase was under warranty until I took it apart myself because I didn’t plan on going through the process of sending it in. I’ve checked the connectors make sure they’re secure for any blown capacitors as these were the most common reasons for a white screen that I came across but no avail. I’m not entirely sure what the problem could be was wondering anyone here might have an idea as what is going on? At this point I just answers whether or not I’m able fix it.
3,e21myn,AcerOfficial,9,2019/11/27 09:56:12,Morning,Acer Predator drivers? Hi I purchased a Predator Helios 300 NH.Q5PEX.025 it came a resource dvd that I assume has drivers utilities but the laptop itself doesn't have a dvd-rom lol so obviously can't use it. I installed win 10 on it ran all the updates touchpad display drivers probably work since it's working but the Predator Sense Turbo mode button don't do...anything? I assume they need drivers so I installed Acer Care whatever predator sense utility is but it changed nothing those buttons still don't do anything. When googling for drivers I found like 18 separate files for each thing display touchepad etc so I'm not sure what do.

It's making a funny noise close the fans.... is not the sound of the fans themselves but more like an Rrrrrrr type of sound like the fans where hitting a little piece of paper. This is not affecting the laptop's performance but it is quite annoying I worry this could be something that might affect the laptop on the long run... BTW I don't have warranty because I'm out of the country... Also I've noticed that the temps rise quite high 80-90 C while running games for a short time... like an hour the most...The surface right above the keyboard gets burning hot can't even keep a finger more than a second on it... is there a way counter this effects? Some say underclock it others say not do this... Some say buy a cooler pad others say this can damage the laptop's fans performance... Some say buy a laptop fan cooler others say not ...Others say changing the thermal paste on it...Some say upgrade the BIOS for better performance others say not mess updates only necessary... etc So what can I really do about the temps?

6,dlpibn,AcerOfficial,0,2019/10/23 14:16:31,Afternoon,XVR273K 4K 144hz HDR Working  I wanted post it here. And also rant about Acer support. But first how set up 4K 144hz. 1. In the OSD menu Turn off FreeSync 4k-144hz HDR. 2. Connect screen GPU using both DP cables 3. Turn 4k-144hz mode back on in the OSD menu. 4. The res 4k 144hz should now be available in e.g Nvidia Control Panel 5. Download Acer Display Widget select HDR Reason why I’m writing this I called Acer Support in Sweden they were ro absolutely no help what so ever. First time I called the guy took my email said he was going ”look things up” reconnect me via email. Never happened. Second time I called the girl at support argued me that 144hz is not necessarily supported just brcause it says so on the box. She kept arguing that the computer detects the suported modes theres nothing they can help me . Then she told me I have Lower the resolution in order access 144hz. I asked her they have a manual online because I didn’t get one in the box. She said ”No”. Finally she told me ”If anyone knows about our products it’s us ok?”. Ok Trump whatever. I called a third time got connected some guy. He took my email promised a reply. He replied by email confirming that 4k 144hz is possible AMD cards. Wait. That’s all have say? Ok. I then proceeded call Acer US Support. The guy kept asking about serial number SNID number just eventually say ”Sir I’m getting an Emachines computer here.” I was like ”what? No I’m calling about an Acer XV273K monitor what are talking about?!” Then he told me ”I will have put on hold for 2 minutes.” And I was like ”Why? For what?” ”Well confirm that it is a monitor”. And I was like ”Well yeah because I just gave the model of the product I need help . Now just have help me. What do mean?” Anyways he put me on hold just for it all disconnect after 10 minutes. Not once did they even bother step me through any settings or anything. It’s unreal how pay 800 dollars get no support incomplete manual. Thanks Acer. Never again.

Thanks This device is a week old it came Linux. I bought it at the very well-know German notebook shop notebooksbilliger.de Everything worked great until I put in a second regular SSD Samsung 860 EVO 1TB. The factory M.2 SSD stays in it is the one keeping my Linux OS. 2 things up first I always disconnect the battery when upgrading first! I googled youtubed this like hell yesterday There is no boot option Legacy in my Bios - UEFI ONLY! Upgrade was super easy. Took me 20min. Watched official video from Acer on YouTube. I reconnect battery. I reboot check the BIOS first. The first Main page shows all my drives Manufacturer Model number. I reboot boot Manjaro Linux. Everything fine. Both drives are shown. I format the new SSD! I shutdown put the bottom case on properly again screw the screws back in. I reboot No bootable device found . My body shivers hot cold my pulse goes 200. I reset the BIOS many times by pressing power button for 2 minutes Nothing. I disconnect the SSD again. Nothing. I boot a Linux live USB stick. Hard drives do not show. I find out Manjaro Live USB lets me detect other bootloaders. It finds my M.2 SSD's grub efi file. How the BIOS cannot find the drives? WTF???? My operating system boots flawlessly. All drives are detected readable writable. I can now only boot my OS from a USB Manjaro Stick. I can never install another OS again? UPDATE this morning suddenly also the Live Linux from USB recognizes my drive. For a split second before the boot menu of the Manjaro Live USB stick came up I THINK I saw my regualar system's grub menu in plain black grey. The Manjaro Live Bootloader does NOT look like this at all! Does anyone have any news on this bug?

My old Dell laptop would only spin the fan when the cpu hits a threshold. So usually during idling it wouldn't spin remain quite. However the Helios 300 spins at 1680 RPM for cpu although it's not loud at all there's still a small fan spin sound from the back even when idling. Does the laptop have a continuous fan spin even at low speeds? Also it only stops when In sleep mode. As soon as I turn it back on the fan resumes but at low speeds.

Everything is working great EXCEPT the wifi. I have 60 Mbps down 5 up. I moved within 7 feet of the router visible in a straight line the best I got was 10 Mbps a horrendous loaded latency 300ms using fast.com . Tested on multiple other devices from the same location Macbook Google Pixel got 30 Mbps 100ms loaded latency. I wiped all of the killer control center software retested same results. I reinstalled the killer control software retested same results. I grabbed 2 different USB wifi receivers I use on desktop computers in the furthest part of the house where I usually get 20-40 Mbps 150 loaded latency I still got bad results. I tested out the 2G 5G bands same bad results. Plugged an ethernet into the router get a perfect 60 Mbps down 5up 50ms loaded latency. It's very much less than ideal have this always plugged in it seems clear something is off the wifi so looking for any tips tricks that have helped people. Router is Motorola MD1600.

Hi Reddit-Acer-Gaming-Peps So I've just adquired my Acer Predator Helios 300 I've been reading some threads on Acer other sites about things can can't do it... 1. First I've read that it has the Windows Product Key directly placed on the BIOS... is this true? what does that mean? Can I change the OS a Windows Pro without issues? 2.

Are there any softwares I need dowload? or specific Settings so it can perform as clean as possible? things check every now then ...? 3.

3,dgfcao,AcerOfficial,4,2019/10/12 05:41:14,Night,Why Acer use Endless OS as Windows alternative? I bought a laptop Linux preinstalled. It shipped Endless OS. I have never heard of it. I expected it ship Ubuntu Fedora or Debian. But It shipped a Linux inactive community. I know I can remove it install any other distro. But I'm curious why Acer use Endless OS? Why not use something like Ubuntu or Fedora? Endless OS came nouvea drivers Open source bad Nvidia driver that heats GPU drain battery for no reason . If a user stick it more than 3 hours the GPU internels could suffer damages. It's that bad. Why the Linux wasn't even optimized for the hardware like Dell laptops do? PS This is not a rant but I am just curious.

So i recently purchased Corsair k95 rgb keyboard which I plug into USB 3.0 port. The problem is that when I turn the laptop off the keyboard lights keep working. The only thing that helps is I unplug plug the keyboard back in which is certainly annoying do every time I shut the system down. I have tried updating drivers installing acer quick access software which does have option 'Power off usb charging' but unfortunately turning it off there doesn't seem do anything. I should mention that the problem doesn't exist the keyboard is plugged into USB 2.0 port. Switching it that port wouldn't resolve my problem since I would have the same issue other peripherals then. I entered BIOS searched but there doesn't seem be such option. Any help regarding how disable USB charging while the laptop is shut down is greatly appreciated. Cheers.

I happen own a Predator X27 have noticed recently a couple of dead pixels. After contacting the support they claim that the terms of the warranty specify the following There shall not be more than 4 defective pixels per million pixels on a given LCD display. Additionally the display panel is divided into 9 equal rectangular areas there shall not be more than one defective pixel in the central area of the display. x200B Which would mean that for a 4K display like mine there isn't at least one dead pixels in the center area it would require 32 dead pixels be covered by the warranty which is a ridiculously high number. x200B x200B On the other hand this web page clearly states that the threshold of dead sub-pixel is 5 regardless of the resolution which seems be a standard policy across makers x200B So what's going on!?

System specs Acer Aspire E5-571-5428 My issues 1 I know whether there is an empty SSD slot in my Laptop that I can use ? Also the specification of the SSD that's compatible the slot? Otherwise im gonna go a caddy installation setup remove my optical drive. 2 My system is running on the initial BIOS that was on the Laptop I never upgraded it as I found no performance issues whatsoever should I update BIOS before SSD installation ? Its running 2014 BIOS V1.08 i.e. before the spectre meltdown patch at all there was a BIOS patch . Also I kept reading that before loading the SSD I need update BIOS so that system is more compatible the SSD ? 3 Could also help me a link for the original user manual detailing the motherboard other internal configurations of the system like the SATA compatibility of the Drive port ? I presume SATA III Ram card configuration specs etc ? I tried the conventional links at acer website but the simply have user manuals stating the bare minimum specs of the device which is not so useful help me upgrade the laptop internals. I am right now running on a singe 4gb Ram card I have an old Dell that got busted it uses a 2x 3gb Ram Card. P.S.

August 19th 2019 I purchased the best device regarding specs I have ever owned I was going use it for school as most people who had it says that battery can last up 8 hours. Bought it directly off of acer.ca I'm Canadian . When I started school on September 4th I already noticed my battery lasted about 2 hours while doing practically nothing. I checked the serial number went repair my Acer. It said that my warranty was expired as it was purchased on December 10th 2018. This came as a surprise as I was their for the purchasing of the laptop. I am guessing Acer sent me a refurbished laptop which is NOT WORTH 1 500!! I feel scammed am not having a good experience from Acer support as I'm just getting message instructions on how send the laptop Acer. I truly believe this is unfair should be handled accordingly. - Much Obliged help me.

They play fine when in the browser window but freeze up as soon as they go full screen. This doesn’t happen on the laptop screen only when going HDMI out a panel or projector.

I think I may buy a new laptop in the next few weeks. Either that or upgrade this thing... maybe I'll just put two big SSD's into it max out the RAM. However since I always find Acers be notoriously cheap in a good way it wouldn't break the bank for me just get a new one! Maybe there's something a little slimmer? Maybe something of the same size but more powerful? An 8th gen i5 or i7 would be an improvement on battery life at least...

I know its time for an upgrade but I'm saving up for it. I usually don't use this laptop let it sit it's well taken care of works like new . Of its weirdness. So I decided use the laptop for a bit before I changed the thermal paste. I pressed the power button nothing happend. Plugged in the charger still nothing. The charge lights worked fine the always on USB port worked fine as well. Maybe it was the CMOS so I changed the battery altogether. Yes I let the motherboard sit for a few hours before reinstalling the battery. Screwed everything up plugged in the power immediately the laptop turned on except it was a black screen no hard drive activity but the power light was on. Tried force shut down by pressing the power button but no response I cannot shut down the laptop unless I remove the charger the battery Maybe I let it sit while it's on then something would happen? Nope nothing except it got very hot because the fans don't spin yes I plugged in the fan yes it does spin a bit when I plug in the power. the laptop still turns on as soon as I plug in the charger I let it sit without the battery or charger CMOS battery in place over night but still a black screen a power light. Tried the fn esc plugged in the power a bios in my USB no activity light on the USB. The last thing I used on the laptop was a light photoshop edit then it got a proper shutdown was tucked away maybe 3 weeks ago. Any help would be appreciated I will bug the Acer forums later. Laptop is running windows 8.1 its updated I like 8.1 all the latest drivers installed.

I have been trying work out USB-C charging after hours of research i still cant seem understand If it does or doesnt work this laptop model. i tried a standard 65W 20V usb-c laptop charger but it wouldnt work this is either down the fact i need an ACER branded charger which they dont seem sell themselves here in the uk or because the standard charger uses 19v instead of the general 15 or 20v all other chargers seem use. If anyone can provide any info i would be greatly appreciative ive spent hours reading countless opinions of people claiming it does work doesnt work needs a specfic charger etc Also anyone knows roughly how much repairing the charge port will cost i think its bent needs replacing that will be useful also. THANKS!!!

1,cw5cde,AcerOfficial,1,2019/08/28 06:37:59,Night,Issue headphone port on Acer Chromebook Spin 13 T I'm posting this in chromeos AcerOfficial So for university I've purchased an Acer Chromebook Spin 13 the Pentium model linked here It's impressive but there's a problem. Whenever I plug headphones into the jack it doesn't play any audio through them videos start stuttering/lagging. I definately have the headphones selected in Audio Settings. This happens on different sets of headphones ones without microphones. I need close the lid/restart for the audio come back through the speakers for videos play smoothly taking the headphones out isn't enough. I thought the headphone port was stiff needed more force insert the 3.5mm jack than my other devices. I believed this be a hardware fault so I returned the Acer the store got a replacement sent through. It arrived today I'm typing on it now it exhibits the EXACT same behaviour. Plugging any headphones into the port leads silence stuttering videos. I am currently listening audio through an USB sound card it's working perfectly the headphones that don't work in the port. I've Powerwashed it restored settings no change. Is this just a software issue that I should report or is this likely a hardware fault common the batch that the retailer has in stock? I'm considering buying a USB-C 3.5mm adapter living it. Any help would be appreciated.

1,cnsj4o,AcerOfficial,4,2019/08/09 13:42:24,Afternoon,Just bought a Acer XFA240 So far i'm liking it other than a few small things but one of the biggest issues for me is how Gsync/freesync is impossible for me find i've looked everywhere on google no one seems have this problem. Freesync is not automatically turned on the GSYNC option in my NVIDIA control panel is not there. How do turn on Freesync on this monitor? I've went through the buttons on the bottom right like 50 times since I've gotten it I just could not manage find a way turn it on. When I go into the NVIDIA control panel it also doesnt have the little nvidia icon in the monitor picture display which means it non-validated BUT I have a validated monitor. TL DR 1. How do I turn on FreeSync? 2. How do I make the GSYNC option pop up in my NVIDIA Control Panel?

3,cn3f4k,AcerOfficial,4,2019/08/08 01:09:38,Night,Helios 300 stuttering problems while playing games Im at my wits end here. I've had my Helios for about over a year without any problems however about 2 months ago I started encounter frame dip stuttering in games that I had no problem before that the Helios should easily handle Warframe Kurtzpel ect. . I tried updated both graphic drivers the core drivers no change. Closed all unnecessary programs while I was playing still stuttering. I thought it was an overheating problem but even undervolting running my fans at max made no difference. Someone on the Acer forums suggested a program called TrayPwrD3 but that didn't seem help either. Aside from contacting Acer directly or trying a full system restore I have no idea what do. Any suggestions would help.

2,clnudo,AcerOfficial,4,2019/08/04 13:05:01,Afternoon,Where's the turn of monitor button on the acer xf270h? There are two switches one is the classic button that every monitor has the other is an I/O switch... both end up doing the same thing. HOWEVER my actual question is how do just simply turn off the monitor instead of it shutting off completely? x200B x200B Explanation - I have another Acer monitor s271hl had a dell monitor together be a dual monitor setup . Press their power buttons the monitor would go black the other monitor would be exactly as is. Open applications desktop icons remain in their places. - I replaced the dell monitor this new acer one the xf270h . It causes a few problems but it essentially stems from the fact that instead of just powering off like any old monitor... it completely shuts down or something. i.e. press either of its two power buttons... all the desktop icons open applications move over my other Acer monitor until I turn it back on. Even the task bar's messenger icon show desktop bar thingy that's on the primary monitor moves over... as that monitor becomes non-existant. - The same thing does not happen when I turn off the s271hl leave the xf270h on. - I have windows 10 Radeon RX 580 gpu this is also new... but its not like the old acer is affected so i dont think its the gpu's fault New Acer is connected its Display Port Old Acer is connected its HDMI. Admittedly the Dell was only ever connected another hdmi port so... that's an untested variable. - I am absolutely not a tech components guy so please be specific about what more information 'd need. x200B So how do I make it that turning off the New Acer monitor doesn't completely wipe it off my computer?

What was nothing more than an inconvenience back than has deteriorated into extremely unreliable charging on top of that the loose connection is emitting some nasty mosquito like noise into the audio output . By opening the notebook I was able bend the upper spring of the charging port which improved the grip a little bit still not reliable but I was unable remove the plate above the jack enough possibly take it out entirely so I didn't go any further.

3,cj3lf3,AcerOfficial,2,2019/07/29 16:10:19,Afternoon,Acer Predator Helios 500 Using Battery Even When Plugged In So as the title states my Helios 500 uses the battery even when it's plugged into AC power. So when I'm browsing doing things. It's not an issue the battery recharges. But when I fire up a game or something that puts a load on the cpgpu. It seems actually be pulling power from the battery slowly because gaming for 5-6 hours would easily drain the battery nothing almost twice over. Is this essentially just a trick the system is using because it can't pull enough power from just the AC cord? Or is there something else going on? It does charge when I'm not putting it under load so it's not some weird glitch in that respect.

4,ci1zqg,AcerOfficial,1,2019/07/27 04:02:52,Night,The future of the Predator Laptop series AMD chipsets. In case 've been living under a rock the recent AMD announcements of the new Ryzen CPUs Radeon GPUs it is now possible have outstanding performance without having pay the intel/nvidia premiums. The Helios 300 laptops are by far the best bang for the buck in the entire industry. Nothing compares. Anything less won't have such a good experience. Anything more 'll be paying too much for the extra fps or graphical settings. The juice is just not worth the squeeze. With that in mind I started theorize what could happen the Helios lineup AMD chipsets instead of intel/nvidia's. I see two possible ways of going 1- Use AMD chipsets maintain performance at the current level or mini upgrade but LOWER the laptop price from 1200 back 1050 or 1000 which was the price of the 2017 model before they added 144hz screen. 2- Use AMD chipsets keep the price at 1200 but upgrade from XX60's equivalent GPU's XX70's. I am not sure the form factor would keep it cooled enough the 2019 model sure handles the 1660ti just fine. But it would be nice see free sync in the panel better IOs possibly make it even lighter thiner etc. x200B Acer could also keep the GPU at XX60's equivalent just have the panel free sync put the price at a comfortable 1100. We all know that future-proofing is a fallacy in this industry so there's never a reason spend too much on laptops/parts since they are going be superseded in 2 3 years. My best guess on how navigate these waters is keep using the Helios 300 lineup get a new one every 2 years. I bought the 2017 Helios 300 model for 1170 tax shipping sold it exactly 2 years later for 760 . That's only 410 for 2 years of great performance reliability. I don't think spending around 500 every 2 years keep yourself the most up date parts is expensive. It is a fair price Acer keeps improving this lineup I will most surely continue purchasing the newest models regularly. x200B Thoughts?

I disable RAID0 after getting this laptop so here are my questions Do I just have change the storage mode from RAID AHCI then fresh install windows? When formating the drives for clean install should I leave the tiny OEM Recovery partition alone? I've also read suggestions that I should only populate the first drive Win at setup then create a volume for the second from Windows' partitioning tool. Will this practice be okay for my soon come Predator Triton 500? It's a hugely expensive laptop I really don't feel like taking it another city for warranty an issue appears. Does the option switch off RAID0 in favour of AHCI even exist in the Triton 500 BIOS? Also what are some safe undervolt configs or screen calibration presets for this beautiful machine?

The performance on the 1660TI variant seems excellent but I have not heard much about the 2060 variant. My gut said that the 2060 would whoop the 1660TI but after reading this I am not so sure.

So I'm trying hook my laptop my older Sony Bravia HDMI which doesn't have an option fix screen scaling as it's an older TV model the screens don't fit on my TV. My crappy AMD had an option fix overscan by a slider when using a second moniteTV. So here is my issue. Acer's latest driver for intel UHD doesn't include a slider bar when configuring overriding application settings in the scaling options. Newer intel drivers ADD this option but since this is a 3rd party that driver is not compatible even when trying install it manually it wont work. So until Acer updates it's drivers I'm SOL. Because everything is integrated the only option config screen settings is thru Intel's control panel as everything else has limited options or just doesn't work by its self like Geforce's Stand Alone App Anyone have any ideas on what I can do?

At first I got a Lenovo Y740 I loved it but unfortunately had return it due the fact I got a defective unit that stopped charging after 10 days. Then after that I got the ASUS ROG Scar II I didn't like it nearly as much returned it due the fact that it had absolutely awful thermals thermal throttled constantly giving it terrible performance. I'm now deciding between getting another Y740 since I liked mine so much or giving the Predator a chance since it'a a bit cheaper. I like what I saw on all the reviews but my main concern is the thermals. So anyone who owns the device Does the CPU or GPU thermal throttle easily when gaming or does it take it a few hours of gaming or does it not do it at all? Thank for the help ahead of time!
1,cbr9v8,AcerOfficial,0,2019/07/11 20:30:06,Evening,Crashes that result in restart Hello all. So back in February I got a Acer Swift 1 SF114-32 laptop recently I discovered this issue it has been having. I only know for sure its been happening for a month but it might have been happening a bit longer than that. Almost every time this issue has happened I haven't been at the laptop so I come back I am back on my desktop no programs open as If I had restarted my computer. At first I thought this was just windows updating while I was away restarting but one time I had manually updated restarted then a hour or two later it restarted again. Upon review there were a few .dmp files but a little over a month ago I had reinstalled windows so there might have been more of these crashes from before then that I had chalked up windows updates. .dmp files in question Any idea on what the causes of these are how I might resolve it? I have already updated my bios upon asking elsewhere I was told the card reader was at fault for atleast a few of them so I reinstalled the card reader driver but still received the latest 2 crashes

So I've been looking at different reviews from an array of different sites am finding that some review sites say this is an IPS panel. The official Acer website says it's a TN panel. Obviously I would trust the official site over anything but wondering I'm missing an IPS version of this monitor. Any insight is appreciated.

Only way I can find fix is remove the DisplayPort cable from the video card re-instate it. I've used the video card on another monitor no issues also switched which DisplayPort I use card has two . Any one else experienced something similiar? Cable issue maybe I'm using the one that came the monitor or monitor faulty?

2,c85rr3,AcerOfficial,4,2019/07/02 22:25:46,Evening,Acer swift 3 or swift 5 for new university student? Which is better? Would appreciate there's a discussion/suggestions/reviews I'm about enter my first year of university is planning get a laptop that will last me for the entire university life maybe even after that. I have always used Acer laptops really liked the brand so I am planning get another Acer laptop. I have narrowed my choices down Acer Swift SF314-56G Acer Swift SF514-53T but is now in dilemma which I should get. Here's my criteria for the new laptop Light Affordable approx SGD 1200 but willing spend more it's rlly worth it Long battery life nice design good keyboard not too firm wont lag when handling huge productivity work like editing photos for projects. I have done my research intending get intel core i7 instead of intel core i5 even tho it would be more expensive. I have yet make a decision on which I should get as I'm not sure which swift 3 or swift 5 is the best choice for me...hence i would rlly appreciate there's some discussion between the pros cons of these models. Suggestions are welcome but would hope that it's between Swift 3 Swift 5 since I doubt I will be looking into other brands/models . I'm keen read the reviews of these 2 brands from people who actually owns it too. Edit While doing my research I came across different Swift 3 Swift 5 models listed on Acer official website got a little confused. What's the difference between Swift 3 SF314-52G SF314-54G SF314-56G etc. Also here's the links the models that I'm thinking get Acer Swift 3 SF314-56G Acer Swift 5 SF514-53T

What am I doing wrong? I've tried searching for an answer now for about an hour. Also I'm trying upgrade my BIOS the latest version 1.26 . There are several other updates that come before version 1.26. Do I need install each of these before I install 1.26? Thanks!

When I went turn it on the keyboard fans would turn on but the screen wouldn’t. This has happened some times before but I managed fix it by pressing the reset battery button. This time however that did not work. I tried it a couple times varying button press lengths leaving it off power. One time that I did this a blue screen showed up for a split second showing something related windows but I didn’t have time see what it was. I also saw the beginning screen for windows picture of landscape house time when I tilted the entire laptop back not just the screen. If anyone has any idea on how fix this that would be really appreciated. Thanks!

I asked predator the 1060ti 2070 will come out a 17.3 inch screen the 2060 is only coming out a 15.6 inch screen but I really a 2060 a 17.3 looks like that isn't an option. I believe the 2060 is max p the 2070 is max q which is why I rather have the 2060 I hear max q gpus really don't perform it's full potential so would it be better get the 1660ti a 17.3 or the 2060 the 15.6 inch screen? Thanks

1,c09zqc,AcerOfficial,0,2019/06/14 11:10:19,Morning,Customer Support return process issues for faulty button I recently purchased an SF314-55G I am very happy it. However the enter button arrived very sticky was in fact a French key on an otherwise standard Qwerty set up. The French doesn't bother me it's the stickyness as I have hit the enter button quite hard go New line. I contacted support about getting a new key sent out replace this which unsurprisingly wasn't allowed. I was then forward a UPS sticker told box it myself contact them for pickup. UPS explicitly state lost or damaged they accept no liability best of it is I have pay for all packaging etc. myself. Am I being unreasonable for expecting a package be sent out for me place laptop in return rather than have organise myself? The laptop is still under warranty. Also the customer support assistant hasn't been very helpful in email chain just giving me one line answers little info around boxing required. TLDR New laptop arrived faulty enter button that I replaced. Not a simple return process by any means not sure I'm being unreasonable? Edit Turns out my keyboard layout is actually different what is advertised on the store. Will this affect anything?

While the laptop is idle or I'm doing something that is not very workload intensive I can hear a very annoying clicking noise. I'm assuming that this is one of the fans. The noise is very faint but I'm in a quiet place like a library I can hear it. I thought it would go away a day of use but it has persisted. Should I return this product for a new one or is this a common issue? Thanks!

Now they are taking preorders for the ConceptD 5 7 but not the 9 they were all supposed be shipping in June. Looks me like the hinge didn’t work after all the Triton 900 ConceptD 9 are actually cancelled. Please stop it the vaporware Acer either own up the cancellation or speak up otherwise. Apple MSI etc. are already shipping the following generation of processors at this rate the 9 series ever does release it will already be obsolete.

1,bwsrzq,AcerOfficial,4,2019/06/05 11:19:43,Morning,Bought in August2017 Passed away May2019 - Acer Predator Helios 300 - N17C1 How do I get my laptop resurrected?? To start I used this laptop plenty for gaming. Which is what it was made for. For insight I put 1015 hrs on pubg on this laptop. Why pubg? I'm addicted getting upset must've got it from my dad. Background I'm an EE which isn't must help here without a schematic on my laptop Issue The laptop died while loading up a game. I plug it in..no LEDs lit. I push the battery reset button for 30s 1 minute still nothing. Hold the power button for a minute a half..nada. Dead Troubleshooting I figured it hasn't been cleaned since I purchased so it must be an overheating issue. I open the laptop up clean the fans thoroughly which requires taking the heatsink off the processors. After cleaning I reapply thermal paste close it up still nada. Now I think the battery is shot. Call Acer customer service get some info out of them since I am no longer under warranty. They say send it in for 630 they'll fix it. Ha. Start asking what the issue could possibly be after they had me run through their troubleshooting over-the-phone method... They ask I had my laptop plugged in for an extended period of time. I say I do I treat my laptop as a desktop. Never unplugged. They confirm the battery is shot. I bought the battery online before probing the old battery...mistake...nothing wrong the old battery. Now I have 2. To be fair I don't have a dmm...had borrow one from work. With the laptop opened plugged in battery also connected...the mother board is receiving 19V from the wall...0.145V from the battery. Motherboard is receiving power...still no LEDs lit or power on. I'm out of ideas what could it possibly be? Thanks for any help -Rabbit
