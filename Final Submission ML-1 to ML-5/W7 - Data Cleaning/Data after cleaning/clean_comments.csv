"fru7bw","SuggestALaptop","just for your consideration from my point of view for gaming one you need good single core processor many suggest amd here which most of the time are good with multicore just look at cpu userbenchmark first to see how good is the processor single core rating albeit the website might be slightly biased towards amd and maybe watch some youtube review on how the laptop works on your needs and just reminders sometimes amd had bad drivers personal experience so better watch review videos first "
"fru7bw","SuggestALaptop","coolmathgames is eternal all zoomers from the old to the young have played it recommend picking up something like dell inspiron 5575 used to use one and while they can be quite expensive normally they go on sale pretty often picked mine up on sale officially from dell site for 550 cad which is barely in the 400s in us dollars very similar laptop is the motile 14 performance laptop which has almost the same specs with sexier chassis or what not which can be found here for 419 usually 600 or so they re basically identical laptops so it really just point of picking your poison if you want to deal with dell or motile and of course looking for any other factors that may interest you between them upgrade ability durability etc if you go down bit honestly recommend buying chromebook something x86 with at least 4gb of ram and replacing chromeos with something lean like arch linux should run minecraft with optifine and coolmathgames like charm for 300 or even less if you go refurb "
"fru7bw","SuggestALaptop","one decent option to consider is dell inspiron 14 with iris plus integrated graphics it ll be quite bit better for light moderate gaming than most options you ll find in this price range and it has 10th gen cpu unfortunately the display on it is pretty mediocre and it only has 4gb of ram upgradable in the future though an even cheaper option that would work well is an acer aspire with ryzen processor 8gb of ram and 256gb ssd unfortunately it again has mediocre 768p display but it hard to find much better at this price point it ll certainly work well for minecraft browser games for more suggestions check out my recommendation guide if you have any questions feel free to ask "

"frs0i2","SuggestALaptop","hey did little more research cause bored yay quarantine looks like the one you listed with the gtx1650 has ryzen5 3550h comparing to my fx505 with i5 9300h with gtx 1650 based on what found about our specific models it looks like the i5 is little more powerful but not by just whole heck of lot however the ryzen uses less power and generates less heat honestly think this is all around good news for you as said before in the vast majority of games and situations my gpu will be at 100 and my cpu will be at 30 50 it actually kinda rare that my cpu goes over 50 60 usage so the drop in performance from the i5 to the ryzen shouldn actually impact game performance further the reduced heat and power consumption should ensure you never run into thermal throttling and should also make the machine last longer since the internals like the motherboard won be expanding and contracting as much from heat fluctuations also might keep your power supply brick from getting quite as hot as mine does gotta make sure it not covered by anything also you might get better performance unplugged than do the battery cannot produce full wattage so gaming performance is reduced when unplugged your machine uses 15 less watts for the processor so performance reduction should be less when unplugged think haha"

"fngyyv","SuggestALaptop","have been hunting for my perfect machine for while and just can find it ve been in your position last year while was saving as much as could since was leaning towards msi ps63 in late august msi prestige 15 got announced and it improved lot of stuff compared to ps63 and that when knew that wanted to get that also since my limit was right around 1400 1500 and the base p15 was 1399 which actually ended up purchasing in october to be honest if had 300 more for the equivalent xps 15 in terms of specs core cpu 16gb ddr4 ram 512gb ssd maybe would get it but the thing with the xps 15 not just the latest 7590 but also the 9570 and all the previous ones is that if you happen to get non defective unit you kinda won the lottery don have the luxury to gamble with 1800 laptop that will get obsolete in around years prestige 15 has none of the infamous xps 15 issues take look at dell and read reviews in dell site and you ll know what talking about also use my prestige 15 for programming and so far it has been amazing ll just mention what you ll get for that extra 300 or 400 forgot with the xps 15 better build quality prestige 15 fan exhaust area is plastic and there where you ll hear little cracking coming from when you lift it also the hinges are plastic but mine have no issue so far the bottom cover over the fans has lot of punctures for air intake and those resulted in weaker metal panel on the bottom of the laptop but only the punctured part is bit flexible the rest is very sturdy the screen is flexible but it isn an issue for me at all bigger battery better battery life on my prestige 15 fhd model with brightness at around 150 to 210 nits 50 to 70 on my unit light coding on intellij with with not so frequent builds runs couple of browser tabs open no battery saver of any kind although read the next point keyboard lightning sometimes on but mostly off get around to hours constantly with brightness only set to 50 and no keyboard backlit on battery saver on window settings on the taskbar can get around 10 11 hours with just web browsing and no video streaming video streaming consumes around 10 more power full cpu performance on battery prestige 15 is locked to 15w cpu tdp compared to 50w on charger on charger both cpus perform pretty much identically no way to override this on battery that i7 10710u on the p15 performs between an i5 9300h and an i7 8550u gpu performance isn affected on battery brighter fhd display and 4k display although xps 15 4k displays are both glossy 500 nits for xps 15 fhd display vs 300 on p15 the 4k display of the p15 is rated at 400 nits better gpu p15 gpu is the maxq variant of gtx 1650 and it performs from 10 to at most 50 less in particular games in benchmarks and video editing software usually around 20 worse at most what does prestige 15 have over xps 15 great price what you get ratio prestige 15 is quite special since at the moment there isn any laptop with this type of configuration for the price more portable thinner lighter smaller footprint smaller and more versatile 90w usb charger in my opinion it has better keyboard and touchpad the keyboard for me is ideal the right amount of travel and feedback the keys are bigger and it has extra pgup pg down insert delete buttons that frequently use the thouchpad winder although not everyone prefers that it doesn interfere with my right palm but this depends on the way how you type it is very smooth identical to macbook pro 2016 or later of course clicking is not the same and tracking is very accurate matte 4k display if you plan on buying it highly suggest you get the 4k matte display since reading code all day will be much more comfortable best buy sells p15 config which is the same as the 1399 config but it has the 4k display it costs 1499 usb thubderbolt ports it is also more upgradeable 2280 nvme pcie gen3x4 ports inside also supports sata3 drives you can get the best of both worlds since no perfect laptop exists will ever exist but these two are very close xps 15 design is very modern in 2015 when it came out it was lot of years ahead of any other laptop last year laptops started to catch up to xps15 design with super thin bezels and stuff only talking about 15 laptops on the same category as xps15 to me prestige 15 made more sense but mostly because of the price you gotta choose between the better keyboard and touchpad as you mentioned since you ll be using them all day or better build quailty that it will be more noticeable only when you carry the laptop around also if you don really care about full performance on battery get the p15 up to you as of x1 extreme the 1st gen is better although the battery life doesn come close to p15 or xps15 every laptop will last for long time if you be more careful with it and not throw it around "

"fruka9","mac","that model you re looking at is the original 5k imac released in october 2014 it nearly years old and the 4ghz quad core i7 haswell will be ok for what you re wanting to do 32gb of ram is fine as well would not buy that particular configuration you re looking at though do not buy any fusion drive even if it 3tb because they are just too slow with only 128gb of flash storage combined with 7200 rpm hard drive that much slower than an ssd try and get an ssd even if it only 512gb because it will make massive difference in terms of performance would also be concerned about the radeon r9 graphics only having 2gb of video memory because that the baseline graphics card and the majority of the graphics card and video memory is used to run the 5k display that also an m290x which is mobile graphics chip that would be used in notebooks so it will definitely struggle with running 5k display especially if you re doing any video editing would definitely consider buying 2019 imac at this point because the configuration you re looking at is an core i9 with vega 48 graphics for nearly 000 more there gonna be no comparison in terms of all the extra performance your going to get and the imac will be much newer personally don see why you rather have year old core i7 with slow fusion drive and crappy 2gb mobile gpu when you could have an core i9 with an ssd and powerful vega 48 gpu with 8gb of video memory for 000 more that will last years longer than an old 2014 imac in terms of software support the 2014 imac will be supported until 2022 think whereas the 2019 imac will definitely be supported until at least 2026 imacs generally get major os releases so that 10 14 10 22 or whatever it called for the 2019 imac the 2014 imac launched on 10 10 so that will be supported till around 10 18 that will be released in 2022 have 27 inch 2019 5k imac too but mine has the base 3ghz core i5 16gb ram the base 570x 4gb graphics and 1tb ssd ve only had mine for about months and my configuration isn nearly as high end as what you re looking at but that can edit 4k 60 videos absolutely fine with no problems at all also edit loads of raw photos in affinity photo shot on both my iphone plus and my canon 700d up to 18 megapixels and again it handles that absolutely fine with no problems or slowdowns at all have heard really good things about the core i9 and vega graphics know ve probably gone off topic bit but basically what saying is buy the 2019 imac for almost 000 more "

"fqgrlw","mac","yes the technology inside the new macbook air is 10 years more advanced youa tll notice significant performance gains from your current macbook pro even the base model for us 999 is massive upgrade from your pro "
"fqgrlw","mac","it will be miles faster than your mbp at basically everything unity won be the best experience especially 3d but if you re working on relatively simple stuff it should be totally fine certainly better than waiting days for your builds to complete before you can use your mac again which is something else and no you won fry the motherboard from heavy use there been some overblown anger about the thermals in the new model but it ll just run the processor slower if it gets too hot and if it was really in any danger of getting damaged any modern computer will shut itself off before it gets to that point "

"fqgrlw","mac","personally own macbook air 2018 and it great there are only two things to take into account the usb ports which you need one or more dongles if you want to plug stuff in personally bought manelord adapter for 20 something dollars and it has been working great here the link the other thing to take into account is how loud the fan is although if you have 2010 macbook pro think you won even notice if you have problem with the second one or if you absolutely need to edit 4k video my advice is to either go with the 16 inch macbook pro if you need it right now and you have the money or wait for the new 14 inch macbook pro that is rumored to come out later this year but think even the new ipad pro would be better than your 2010 machine if you just need it for web browsing documents and even video editing with lumafusion that is 20 dollars on the app store btw "

"fo5v7n","mac","have macbook air 2019 version and am pretty big fan use it mostly for web browsing and also for some light development work for some of my classes think that for school having the portability would be really important my air has 128 gb of storage and even with programs like matlab with extensions and other moderate sized programs installed still have plenty of space so the 256gb base model should be fine fans aren really an issue in my experience even when running quite few things at the same time honestly the air 2020 looks like fantastic machine for any student looking in that price range imo "

"fnh820","mac","personally would go with the macbook pro for the series processor which will have higher base clock speed but would still spend the money to get the 16gb or ram would also upgrade to 256gb of storage if you are comparing base mbp vs air with 16gb ram go with the air 4x the storage and twice the ram"

"fr788i","Dell","what wrong with them can ask why are they waste of time "
"fr788i","Dell","just turn off scheduled updates and run drivers and downloads manually preferably just after you ve created system image via control panel backup and restore windows create system image use an external drive to store the image usb thumb drive doesn work as windows considers it an invalid destination but usb hdd works fine and make sure you also have created system repair disk srd to use for restoring the system image you only have to create the repair disk once then it can be used to restore the current and future system images and you can use usb thumb drive to create the srd it easier and faster to create the system image if you partition your physical internal drive into an os partition and one or more data partitions and move your user folders documents downloads pictures appdata roaming etc google moving windows user folders to the data partition then you only need to include the default os partition efi system and windows recovery partitions in the system image but if you do that you should also backup your data partition using either 3rd party backup tool acronis true image storage craft spx etc or the windows backup tool don like automatic updates because you never know for sure when they might happen and really don trust that updates from dell might not somehow collide with windows updates so uninstall dell update which seems to run automatically with no user control over scheduling and leave support assist which also includes dell update plugin don uninstall that with scheduling off and use the windows update advanced settings to pause windows updates for month or so then at the beginning of every month make my system image and full data backups then run dell support assist to manually download dell driver updates usually select only one update at time and restart my system between updates because don trust dell or support assist to handle multiple concurrent driver updates then resume windows updates and do check for updates multiple times until is says there are none to perform and finally pause windows updates again to sometime past the first of the following month yes this is lot of setup work and requires couple of hours of maintenance time each month but at least don need to worry about some automatic update messing up my system at critical time except possibly windows defender updates which seem to be automatic no matter what but these haven caused me any problems so far source working on computer hardware and software since 1974 and every version of windows since and have maintained somewhere around dozen dell computers over the years current systems are dell g5 5587 win 10 pro and dell xps 13 9370 win 10 pro "

"fpxqzy","Dell","glueing it would only work as temporary fix especially if you open and close your laptop regularly because the back cover is what actually provides most of of the structural integrity of the laptop and what keeps the palmrest from flexing when you open the laptop the only permanent fix would be to try and solder that piece back on or replace the palmrest "
"fpxqzy","Dell","this happened to me have accidental damage but won let their support people touch my laptop again just my location and history with them tried epoxy and another glue waste of time go on ebay and get palmrest for 25 clean everything and give it new thermal paste it will last for years "

"fqbux0","Dell","make sure you are using the nvidia gpu try setting the global to it and set it back after gaming or benchmarking also with the cpu try to undervolt the cache too and limit the turbo ratio to 33 36 and the turbo power to 25 watts as think that for some undervolting only allows the cpu to consume power more efficiently "
"fqbux0","Dell","this machine problem is that it just can deal with high stress from both cpu and gpu simultaneously kind of coincidence got fallen order recently and has been running it around 50 60 fps at medium graphic settings you just can expect more from 1050 ti max undervolting cpu is the first step when you game make sure disable turbo boost and let the chip runs at its base clock it will prevent the gpu from throttling and gain you better fps then you can download afterburner from msi to undervolt your gpu however one downside comes with lowering cpu clock rates is the game performs bad when there are lot of physical simulations such as explosions or rains you will still see frame drops when you are dealing with bosses in fallen order xps15 chassis is just not for gaming that why the best gaming solution on this model is to get the i5 version without graphics card and use powerful egpu as stated if you have budget to get good enough graphics card you can disable your 1050 ti and use egpu when gaming "
"fqejtt","Dell","also have this exact model upgraded the ram to 32gb did you know that since you have the smaller battery based off of the spec you bought there is place for sata hdd you can buy cable from ebay agree with the battery life it probably the worst of any machine ve ever seen "

"fn56u8","Dell","the solid state drive makes huge difference am guessing you have 1tb hdd 5400rpm drive it was pretty common in many laptops because it is cheap have also experienced the slow performance after few months with solid state drive your computer will never really slow down unless something else happens to it malware defective memory lack of memory etc here is an easy method have done many times there are much better instructions out there sure buy an external hard drive hdd perform windows backup system image to your external hdd you can do this from the control panel this will capture everything exactly the way it is and save it on your external hdd next physically install new solid state drive ssd that is the same size as your old drive or greater the image restore will only work if the ssd is same size or greater if your current hard drive is 1tb you can restore the image to anything smaller than that boot to windows recovery options you might need to create windows repair disc to get to the required menu to select the option to restore your system image plug in your external hdd and restore using system image if you don want to go that route the other option is to buy any ssd then buy windows 10 physically knstall the ssd then insert the windows 10 flash drive and install the operating system on the new ssd the system image is helpful because you won have to reconfigure anything once you restore the image "

"fj5fyo","Dell","it would depend on the level of support that you purchase go price out computer on the dell website you will get to the section about support and you will see the options available their onsite support is good have had them come out before to fix problem and they are timely and knowledgeable of course would assume this would depend on the area that you live in "
"fj5fyo","Dell","there are different levels consumer goods believe are mostly mail in service optiplex latitude and precision stuff usually has next day on site it goes all the way up to hour on site for critical stuff the nicest thing about their warranty for my of that if you have enough of them them they ll let you self dispatch parts "

"fj44hn","Dell","somewhat of novice when it comes to these sorts of performance tweaks but don think undervolting does anything to your temp ceiling would think it means you can run under load at high clocks longer before you reach it and experience thermal throttling again "
"fj0v1r","Dell","in the same boat off loading the gpu outside of the case already reduces thermals which increases the cpu clocking abilities if you go this route please keep us updated "
"fj0v1r","Dell","don have an answer for this but am curious as ve been looking into an egpu for whenever do really graphics heavy work at home and don need it for the road "
"fj0v1r","Dell","as mentioned earlier your thermals will be better since now your laptop is only offloading cpu heat usually the same heatpipe runs across both cpu and gpu but that can vary by model the 2070 is nice bump up from 1650 what exact i7 model of cpu do you have that can be bottleneck for some games but in general you should be in good place for hi res gaming with that setup "

"fg4tec","Dell","additional findings notes the problem is difficult to actually re produce it normally just happens randomly on its own and can actually be re produced which makes troubleshooting more difficult because left to try one fix then use the computer for few days and then decide if think the problem has been resolved or move forward with the next troubleshooting item on the list "

"fg6lbb","Dell","it ll work fine the power consumption on that drive is on the high side though so might somewhat impact battery life it also supports low power states not sure how it impacts performance though "
"fg6lbb","Dell","not overkill it great drive should work very well if you are just upgrading for performance you might check out the latest performance scores on the drive it ships with to see if the speeds are much diff though some laptops ship with really great drives probably unbranded versions of the same high end drives you might consider replacing it with of course if you are upgrading for capacity then get the fastest drive you can afford the 970 evo is probably the best value right now "
"ffzbi6","Dell","would recommend re imaging if you have another computer handy would recommend using the dell os recovery tool this will allow you to re install whatever os came with the laptop have used this several times and it works "

"ffz9ur","Dell","ve had my 7400 for handful of months now yeah it runs pretty hot idle at about 50 55c and it ll reach 80c in an instant under turbo it can hit power draw which the little cooler can handle the bigger issue is the noise from the fan and yeah agree the sound of that fan is nuts our company ended up not offering the latitude 7400 as standard due to the fan noise in an office it not bad because of the general background noise of hvac and such but at home it requires headphones overall still really like the device for general day to day it work technically ve had no problems with drivers or anything no boot problems and no problems with thunderbolt it been real solid "
"ffz9ur","Dell","im having the exact same problems these units dont have enough cooling we recently got try and buy xps 15 and it runs so fast and cool and its pulling 1800 in cinebench instead of 800 we wont be buying these 7400a ts anymore "
"ffzgm5","Dell","thought the new xps 13 was limited to core cpu they lowered the core count when they updated to ice lake"
"ffzgm5","Dell","usually such high end configurations aren available per se in store most likely you have to get it straight from dell "
"ffzgm5","Dell","keep in mind that the keyboard in the us is missing key compared to most of their european counterparts so it not matter of software layout only also if not mistaken the new 2020 model doesn come in the core cpu core version only the in has it in any case say you can forget about getting the top of the line model at store "

"fg0h6x","Dell","look up s3 sleeping xps 7390 in this sub basically these things don s3 sleep so we either force that or live with putting it into hibernation mode and the 20 30 seconds wake up delay that comes with im just doing the latter didnt like dicking with the pwrcfg settings "

"fqy4ot","ASUS","also hate it because of the stupid bugs it has but sadly it is the only software can use for my zephyrus gx502 anything else just doesna tt detect the keyboard plus couple other problems and so had to format everything install the drivers then install the related stuff step by step this might help you install asus system control if your hardware is older than 2018 and asus system control v2 if your hardware is newer or just check what version you have on device manager restart install asus armoury crate service restart install armoury crate uwp and do not open it restart install rog live service restart now open armoury crate and watch your cpu usage on task manager you will find things like rog live service or armoury update doing stuff just let them do it because these things if you ever decide to close the armoury crate they will freak out and corrupt the installation and bam nothing works anymore youa td think asus would be intelligent to at least put warning for the user that it is installing stuff and so you should leave armoury crate open nope nothing at all you have to figure it out yourself and slam your head on the wall wondering whatever happened again if you can use other options than armoury crate then please dona tt install that garbage wrote this guide for those thanks to asus stupid decisions who cana tt use anything but armoury crate "

"etv3kp","thinkpad","excerpts from the link the failures do not steam from defective controller chip design or overheating they occur because one of the firmware updates released last years was flawed this firmware version irreversibly damages the spi rom of the thunderbolt controller over time this also explains why the issue is recent phenomenon affected older systems like the lenovo thinkpad t470 or t480 ran fine for years the issues began when the flawed intel firmware update was released last year the reason why some thinkpads with thunderbolt controllers like the x1 extreme or thinkpad p1 are not affected is that they use different firmware and never were exposed to the flawed version "

"fs4s4y","thinkpad","well it used to be from the mid 2000s on series was for performance never mind the size weight 15 17 series was smallest lightest never mind the performance hit 12 was right in between with balanced size performance 14 15 but then they made things more complicated by introducing the x1 carbon which beat the series on weight by lot so the had smaller footprint and few features the x1c lacked but wasn the lightest anymore then they made it more complicated by jettisoning bunch of features on the x280 like ethernet port docking port and external battery so it was still smaller had mostly the same features as an x1c but still thicker and heavier then they made it yet more complicated by performing the same featurectomy on the t490 then we get to today baffling lineup where the series has 13 screen so it not significantly smaller than the 14 neither or has ethernet or removable battery and the x1c is still smaller and lighter guess the is cheaper than the carbon and you can get it with an amd cpu love series best but have no idea why it still around it make ton more sense if it got folded into the series so you have t13 t14 t15 and the line was retired with x1 taking its place "

"frudie","thinkpad","before you read all of this do apologise for not being able to answer all of your questions perfectly hopefully someone else will be able to answer those if no one can answer the first question the paperwork that lenovo sends with their return parcel will definitely outline your options just can seem to find the digital copy of mine as of now have too many computers it could be on best of luck with the exchange process and hope you enjoy the new x1a always liked them personally have to look at the paperwork again but do think that is possibility had to have the battery battery controller thunderbolt controller and port replaced on my x1c7 after intel whole firmware issue and do think there is possibility to send stuff in without an ssd might just be easier to create backup of your data though and restore it when you get the unit back this way you can still use the files on an alternative computer in the interim while they replace you defective unit with that said though assuming you don have on site support and have to ship it hence the business and not business days wait time that experience may vary for you for your second question not entirely sure what you re saying isn lenovo going to take your old x1e and replace it with another x1e if so then why would you need to replace the screws in the old unit with the ones from the new one aside from that that shouldn be an issue whatsoever if allowed to make an assumption that warranty laws in your country are similar to mine damage to component like that would not constitute voided warranty as the issues you are having are unrelated to the port and stripped screw can be causing issues with display audio as well as if the screws were so tight in the unit from the factory that would actually be on lenovo here and not on the end customer any damage caused being lenovo fault suggest consulting the warranty information provided with the unit or consulting your regional lenovo website for pdf document didn clean up the boot menu when sent mine and didn provide any information on the linux system that had dual booted lvm luks2 encrypted drive so they had absolutely no access too it just made sure to setup grub to auto boot into windows 10 without any menu popping up you have to press key to open make sure it doesn conflict with any of the uefi ones however was obviously in different situation as only have drive and do not have two like you do since you have two definitely remove the linux one and guess you might as well clean up the boot menu you can fix that when you get the new unit still think you should also consider removing any data from the windows partition that is sensitive while trust lenovo as company would never send my device with data on it to any manufacturer warranty service also consider removing your microsoft account from your windows 10 login as well and just provide local account for them definitely take out the linux ssd since you put it on separate ssd and then for the windows 10 installation you have some options there isn proper way per se since it all depends on how paranoid you are and how much time you are willing to dedicate to cleaning it up as mentioned before create backup before doing anything on an external disk there are many cheap usb hdd on amazon there also is usb to drive enclosures although find they are slower than the purpose built usb hdd your mileage may vary then when you go to reinstall windows it gives you the option to delete all of your files obviously select this option then you will be presented with two options one option will do it the fast way although someone particularly epxereienced and with the right tools could restore some or all not entirely sure what method windows is employs so on safe side assume all in laboratory clean room this most likely is fine for you as it practically impossible for someone to do this and companies with the tools to do this would do this for actual clients windows also will present you with the option to actually properly erase the drive depending on the size of the drive and the speed it may take while to do this research can be done to tell you essentially the over simplified explanation of what they do for that is they entirely over write the drive with 0s and then 1s amount of times to ensure that no data can be recovered usually this is done within coroporate environments with setup for multiple drives to be done simultaneously if they do not wish to destroy them and this is most likely not necessary for you once you select whichever option suits you make sure to keep the pc plugged into power outlet for the duration of the process and when prompted setup the pc again most likely without bitlocker encryption although lenovo does allow you to with local user account microsoft does like to hide the setting but it definitely is preferred final note you could also use windows installation medium instead to do the same process the only issue being lenovo drivers and utilities some utilities they use to test things in house if the uefi utilities don suffice will not be automatically installed suggest just using the built in setting if you do use the built in setting however do insure you are on the write version of windows one cumulative update for 1903 or 1909 did break the feature but updating will fix that problem if you re up to date then you ll be fine since think that was back in december "

"fq8hdv","thinkpad","fwiw have t495s running ubuntu 19 10 and am generally happy with it its battery life is comparable to my previous x1c5 at roughly hours the screen is brighter 400 vs 300 nits and it very comparable in size weight terms if you intend to use this anywhere other than in darkened room make sure you re getting the 400 nits low power fhd screen not the 250 nits would definitely go with amd vs intel the gpu is at least twice as fast which makes massive difference even for productivity style work on my 4k monitor and would expect even more so if you intend to play games and then there are all the vulnerabilities affecting intel cpus whose mitigations can make very material difference in terms of performance over time indeed this is the main reason had to upgrade my x1c5 when saw that the newer x1c7 had cpus that were very much as vulnerable as the kaby lake in my previous laptop decided to switch to amd the only issue with amd is that there can still be few more bugs lingering around in oses and drivers particularly linux this t495s is little less reliable than my previous x1c5 let say that encounter lock up typically around suspend resume every weeks or so things are improving as patches get released with all that said agree with others that it might be preferable to wait for the new t14 with ryzen 4000 however with the current situation it anybody guess as to when they ll actually start shipping and they ll obviously be more expensive until then the t495s is solid choice imho "

"fop6s9","thinkpad","x250 will have way way better battery life mostly because of its horrible neutered processor it also has the better screen options so when you dont need performance its very good choice if you do want performance theres no better choice than the x230 the x220 keyboard can be transplanted over to the x230 so thats not reason for the 220 either the only thing it has going for it is the usually slightly lower price "

"fop6s9","thinkpad","had this same conundrum went with the x250 as you can tell by my username weighed all the options and thought about my personal use case what was important to me was battery life screen resolution and price for what you get thought lot about the keyboard especially because type lot but honestly the chicklet style keyboard has been perfectly fine and like having backlight wanted to be able to install 16gb of ram not because regularly use that much ram but prefer to have the option my x250 also has x3 drives ve got the regular sata drive ve got an 2242 in the wwan slot and have the additional 8gb 2242 swap drive under the internal battery that could switch out with something else down the line replacing the stock tn screen with an fhd screen was breeze and it really beautiful for me it was between the x230 and x250 because the x220 doesn have usb3 and knew could easily upgrade the x230 if had to even have 1tb msata drive so it was really enticing to get the x230 and use that but still went with the x250 because got one that looked brand new it has nice form factor battery life is nice and this fhd panel is great bought it for around 180 but after all my upgrades including new internal and external batteries ve probably spent around 450 it makes great hackintosh and also run manjaro i3 on it overall very happy with my choice whenever thread like this pops up rush over to ebay and start looking at x230s but it doesn take more than few minutes before realize that content with my x250 enjoy using it and feel like made the right decision for me good luck "

"fnspex","thinkpad","was able to pick up 430 intel core i5 3320m 60ghz 8gb ram 240gb ssd dvd drive and windows 10 pro 64 bit for 240 through amazon the screen for what using it for is fine not watching hd videos or playing games like the responsiveness of the keyboard built like tank so is bit on the heavy size but should survive drop "
"fnspex","thinkpad","if you are okey with the tn panel would recommend the t430 my first and only thinkpad so far and besides being heavy and thicc boi it awesome use as cad mobile machine and some games updated it to i7 and need 90w charger and bought gdc beast and throw egpu on the expresscard easy and fun little project if you want to game on it would recommend thinkpad with expresscard thunderbolt thx for reading sorry for bad english"
"fnspex","thinkpad","love my t430 the quadcore i7 are getting cheaper as well so that is an upgrade path to consider for you really fkin hate the display it is really washed out and the viewing angle is so bad have the display comparison between the 1600x900 tn matte on the t430 and 1600x900 ips glossy panel on the alienware m14x r2 check on my profile to see it those displays are pretty much plug and play swap you can get barebone t430 sans battery ram storage and adaptor for around 100 by your specification you are going to change them all anyway oh yeah if you can buy t430 with the discrete gpu it is like unicorn plus it dissipates heat better than the integrated gpu one "
"fnspex","thinkpad","so it looks now like leaning toward the t450 like nice display and not sure how hard it is to upgrade the display on the t430 don want to end up with model that has ram soldered in either do the models with an at the end mean the ram is soldered "

"ciu0nd","AcerOfficial","always wonder if don understand the intended question when the answer to the posted question is easily found on the acer website clearly shows 144hz in the overview if you want to change the refresh rate open the display settings "
"ciu0nd","AcerOfficial","up to 144hz can set it either in your pc display settings or nvidia control panel "

"ciot2o","AcerOfficial","any pros and cons of acer swift because im planning to buy one "
"ci1zqg","AcerOfficial","good speculations personally think having acer to use amd chipsets is fair idea as what mentioned above on par with intel processer and of course cheaper "
"chfio6","AcerOfficial","maybe it is the faulty audio port after all how long have you been using the monitor have you tried using another audio device for the output "
"ch5wdi","AcerOfficial","just got the 2060 triton 500 on monday there it runs off its onboard graphics and ia tve got the battery settings set so that even when ita ts using the 2060 on battery power ita ts not using its full potential to make the battery last longer was under the impression the 2060 version had sync too but must be tripping because it favours on board graphics where it can to spare the battery sorry if this wasna tt the answer you wanted"
"ch5wdi","AcerOfficial","you would open the nvidia control panel and simply uncheck the sync option to disable it if you are still confused refer to the manufacturer website hehe rtfm is always going to be more accurate than anecdotes from people who don own the same hardware wondering how much battery life you would actually save considering that unit only has cell 5400 mah battery to run all that hardware maybe will try few of the power profiles and share what the system will automatically adjust to improve battery life "
"cgfude","AcerOfficial","best to send it in if it is bothering or restricting your daily operations but eventually you should also do it before the warranty period expire "
"cgfude","AcerOfficial","this is definitely not to be expected it may be loose or something think this type of repair will not take much times can take it to the nearest service centre "
"cgfude","AcerOfficial","think its best to take to an official acer repair centre for checkup probably loose of it if it can be returned make sure to check on it as well "
"cgdhh7","AcerOfficial","well imho you should trust the acer capability on handling raid0 not sure in doing the fresh windows reinstall yourself will void the warranty or not best to leave it as it is but if you insist yes you may go ahead for the recovery partition it is only usable to the current windows default installed by acer fresh from factory so no point of keeping it if you plan to start fresh "
"cg7j0n","AcerOfficial","you are better off asking your local retail stores that sells acer laptop as different region will have different stock availibility "
"cg7j0n","AcerOfficial","finding refurbished one may be tricky part just have to search properly in your region"
"cg7j0n","AcerOfficial","do not really suggest refurbished laptop but if you re really interested sure go ahead and look at the nearest vendor stores "
"cg4kca","AcerOfficial","1660 ti is faster 2060 is just more affordable rtx capable card"
"cg4kca","AcerOfficial","the rtx performs better based on userbenchmark com but believe the 2060 you select there for comparison is probably the desktop card which probably runs faster than the laptop 2060 as they are usually bit slower due to various constrictions in power and dimension etc however think the 1660 ti even if somewhat slower would probably be more useful for most laptop users since afaik its also more power efficient than the 2060 which is big plus for gaming on the train or unplugged in general havent actually seen what the 2060 laptop gpu powerdraw is but think the 1660s big thing for laptops was power efficiency since it wasn really big revolution in terms of speed increment over previous laptop gpus "
"cg4kca","AcerOfficial","gtx 1660 ti is rtx 2060 without the rt and tensor cores it basically perform the same if you don need raytracing suggest getting the ones with gtx 1660 ti if it cheaper and use the money for something else edit gtx 1660 ti has fewer cuda cores but it not that slower against rtx 2060 only around 10 "

"cfao70","AcerOfficial","can you provide link for the site "
"cfao70","AcerOfficial","since you ll have to open the case to replace the battery why don you open it now for the practice so you can get the part number from the battery in your laptop then you can check with the acer online store to compare their price with many of the other legit online retailers with the correct part number you can also accurately search amazon newegg provantage ebay etc have yet to experience any aspire battery that lasted longer than hours with normal non gaming use even when brand new "
"cfao70","AcerOfficial","depending on how you are using it the short battery life may not be big deal these days you can find power outlet nearly anywhere on campus or coffee shop if you need quick charge if you tweak the power settings turn down screen brightness reduce cpu power etc you can probably easily make it through the day if you aren constantly using it keep in mind that manufacturers test battery life with the strictest low power options to make the test results look better ve been thinking about getting one of those external batteries to carry in my backpack in case my battery gets too low when need it have small one for my phone when travel meanwhile keep searching the wholesale websites to see if can find the same size internal battery with higher capacity this is just one of those things we don focus on when buying reasonably powerful laptop we want the nice screen and performance but none of us really research the battery until we need it to stay charged longer for manufacturers the smaller battery helps reduce the overall weight of the laptop "

"cchzog","AcerOfficial","make sure the driver is installed google radeon drivers and use the auto detect tool "
"cc93f7","AcerOfficial","no it rarely throttles like one in 100 game sessions maybe also it is pre undervolted so temperatures are further reduced get around 70 80a while on turbo boost with fans running at max speed also the battery is amazing with hours depending on usage triton 500 is amazing if you can tolerate the gaming logo which cannot be turned off and some blue tinted keys otherwise say that it is best in the rtx 2060 bunch below razerblade 15 ofc but lower price makes up for it also the laptop is really like really difficult to upgrade as the motherboard is flipped upside down so if you get rtx 2060 model and 512gb of ssd is not enough for you then this might be deal breaker wasn for me as comfortable with using external hdds and don really store much stuff on my laptop anyways "

"capx0f","AcerOfficial","it is completely fine "
"capx0f","AcerOfficial","maybe put back the battery in that way when your electricity goes out it will keep running don worry about the life span of your battery the general rule of thumb of mine at least is when you re about to use your notebook for long period of time keep it plugged in but if you re like using it for 10 or 20 minutes only then you can use it without your charger plugged all the time "
"capx0f","AcerOfficial","there wont be any problem connecting directly to the electric current for this laptop in fact the laptops nowadays are fine connecting directly"
"capx0f","AcerOfficial","modern batteries can handle it just fine "

"c6wm04","AcerOfficial","no that is not normal "
"c6wm04","AcerOfficial","after even further test it seems fixed even if disconnect the monitor from power when plug it back it comes back immediately no matter if the video cables are plugged in or not very weird no idea what happened it could be that the power connector on the monitor side was bit loose it doesn click in it just slides in maybe didn insert it right or something apart from the initial scare super pleased with the display "

"c5axai","AcerOfficial","most likely not as the batteries now are more solid than you think "
"c4zgkl","AcerOfficial","definitely get in touch with service and ask them about it there are probably two ways this happened maybe service just made mistake by replacing faulty ssd with wrong type it should not happen but they are also just people so sometimes this is the case if you contact them without any delay after the repair they should correct this mistake even if your device is out of warranty there might also be another explanation in lot of laptop they use same type of ssds but from different manufacturers and with slightly different specifications perhaps originally there was faster ssd in your laptop but service had only same type but slower ones on stock so they used them then it might be ok there is also third possibility there is problem with this new ssd but only service can get you an answer and eventually solution regarding warranty in my country warranty is extended for the time laptop is in service center maybe it is the same at your country but in this case if you contact service without any delay after the repair do not think it is relevant "
