fgx88w,"Hey,

Maybe this comparison will help you make a decision: [**Acer Predator Triton 500 PT515-51 vs Acer Predator Triton 500 PT515-51**](https://noteb.com/?model/comp.php?conf0=10685936599132999680_2977&conf1=14984806121833000960_2977&ex=EUR&ref=starchaser).

From my point of view, if the price difference is bigger than 100 Euros I would not get the 2070 Max-Q. 

Before purchasing, you should know that this laptop has a reversed motherboard that would make any future upgrades difficult and a sticker that is removed you'll lose any warranty. Except for that, Optimus is not automatic, you'll have to turn it on manually from BIOS. Except for these downsides, it seems to be a good laptop that has good thermals if you keep it at an angle (as long as you don't cover the vents)

Hope I helped!"
fg8atk,"A couple of questions:

1. Screen size preference (14"" vs 15.6"")?
2. Numpad?

> Prefer a built in cd/dvd drive.

No longer an option, will need to make do with an external drive."

fg8atk,"Do you think would would be ok upgrading the hard drive? It would be as simple as unscrewing a few screws, and pushing a drive into the slot."
fg8atk,Thinkpad sounds like something I would look into if I were you
fg8atk,"Hey,

You've got basic needs, these could be met by a laptop with modern specs. You won't need to spend half your budget but there's a catch - you'll have to get an external optical drive (DVD's are obsolete)

Since you want something reliable, I'd recommend a business-grade laptop.

It is a business grade device that comes with a 4-core Ryzen 5 processor and 8 GB RAM, which should be just fine for general use tasks. It is very durable and reliable, which is also why I think it is a good choice. I recommend using an external DVD drive and adding an SSD yourself."
fglc65,"Hi, are you purchasing in the U.S?"
fgl5v7,"Try finding a Fujitsu Lifebook U748 (or U749) in the used market. A new unit would be well beyond your budget.

Re power bridge, there are some variants of the T470/480 that do not have an internal battery. Moreover, you can remove the internal battery if you'd like, and just use the external one.

Or you could even get a T440p. 

It really depends on what you intend to use the laptop for. Might want to expand on that, in your original post."
fgc6iq,"The MacBook Air would actually be perfect for your use case. Keyboard does take a bit of getting used to, but it has the best touch pad ever, and is light with great battery life. It will also definitely last you 3 years. It also runs all the Office apps you need, and MS Office. It might struggle a bit with Photoshop but keep it light and rare and you'll be fine.

I would recommend just the $1099 bottom tier model, unless you need the extra storage. MacBooks are infinitely configurable, so just choose what works for you."

I suppose the lightest for your needs and budget is the LG Gram, 13inch or 15 inches, whichever you prefer. HP Spectre and Lenovo Yoga should also work well."
fg4axd,"I have an extremely similar use case to you, and after doing hours of research, I came upon the Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 2. The build quality is excellent, and it seems like it's going to last a long time. It's very powerful, and also looks discrete and professional. It also has a larger screen size of 15 inches.

I've limited my search to only business-grade laptops under 4.2 lbs that have over 6H battery life, a six-core processor, and dedicated graphics cards.

I think this [**MSI Prestige 15 A10**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=15442567163801999360_3525&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) could be a good fit for your needs. It has a six-core 15W processor, GTX 1650 Max-Q graphics, display with good color coverage, only SSD as storage, 16 GB RAM - 2 memory slots, ~10H battery life, very good peripheral port selection: 2 X USB 3.1, 2 X USB-C 3.1, MicroSD card reader, Thunderbolt, HDMI port so you can link up an external monitor and a Backlit Chiclet keyboard.

Or, if you prefer a stronger processor: [**Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=10169208949741000704_1932&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) - six-core 45W processor, GTX 1050 TI Max-Q graphics, 512 PCIe SSD, 16 GB RAM, ~6.5H battery life and an excellent Spill-resistant, Backlit Chiclet keyboard. This one is ~1450$ online.

Hope I helped!"

fg4axd,"I would recommend this [Lenovo ThinkPad P52](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GQV7BWG/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because of the following:

* comes with 8th gen, i7 hexa core CPU which is powerful for your usage.
*  The display cover is made of a very robust fiber-reinforced plastic material.
* The base is made of a magnesium/aluminum alloy surface material on top of a magnesium roll cage - is even sturdier than the display lid.
 
* The conventional hinges keep the rear side free for additional connectivity and/or fan vents. Their maximum opening angle is slightly over 180 degrees.
 
* Battery life is very good as it lasts up to 10 hours.
 
* It weighs 5.65 lbs.
 
* Comes with  Three USB 3.1 Gen 1 (one Always On), two USB Type-C / Thunderbolt 3, HDMI 2.0, and Ethernet (RJ-45)
 
* Comes with  90% sRGB coverage, combined with the matte display coating, the high brightness of almost 300 nits makes for decent outdoor usability in the shade and on overcast days. It is nowhere near bright enough for working in direct sunlight, though.
 
* Good upgradeability (four RAM slots, three storage bays, WWAN) but it’s somewhat complicated (special tools needed for keyboard).

* Keyboard has a numpad but narrower than the rest of the keyboard, and the arrow buttons shifted.
* Speakers are at the bottom and kinda muffed so a headset is recommended for when you are gaming.

ffvamm,"Hi, I'd imagine that if you want a gaming device, you'll need something discrete especially if someone else like a boss is paying for it. So, I think that the [**MSI Prestige 15**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=6xJhMJDSy2I&mid=44583&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fgrey-with-blue-diamond-cut-msi-prestige-15-a10sc-011-gaming-entertainment%2Fp%2FN82E16834155292%3FDescription%3Dmsi%2520prestige%252015%26cm_re%3Dmsi_prestige_15-_-34-155-292-_-Product) is the best choice since it comes with excellent specifications that can handle some gaming like Fortnite, Apex Legends, etc. The battery life is around 9 hours for light use and weight is around 3.6lbs, which is plenty light."
ffvamm,"I would recommend [this Eluktronics MAG-15 Slim](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X6MJ4X7/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because of the following :

* It comes with GTX 1660Ti  GPU and it will run fortnite, apex legends, and minecraft smoothly, You can check the below link to see how the  GTX 1660Ti GPU  (scroll down for the FPs and settings expected or ctrl+f then type the name of your game).
https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1660-Ti-Laptop-Graphics-Card.386426.0.html
 
* Developed by intel with corporation with different laptop brands.
* According to Dave2D it has great battery life (up to 7 hours with regular usage) and you prefer a good battery life.
* Very light for a gaming laptop at 4.15 lbs, built with Magnesium alloyed ""all over"".
* The speaker gril is in the bottom of the laptop, 3 USB A , Thunderbolt 3, SD card reader and HDMI port.
* Easily upgradeable, removing the back panel gives you access to 2 ram slots that can support up to 64GB ram, the Wifi card if you want to change, 2 NVMe cards, and one of the biggest battery capacity at 93W/H.
* Screen is 144 HZ IPS with high color accuracy 96% RGP and 73% sRGB with up to 290 nt brightness.
* Bezels are pretty thin, camera is up top.
* Keyboard is mechanical but it needs time to get used to it.
* Heat management is great, and it comes undervolted so you can play with that if you need more CPU power.

***

And if you prefer better GPU and would be okay with shorter battery life, then I would recommend this [Eluktronics mech g2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R11SWT5/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20)  because it has great combination between value for money, weight, battery life, and performance.
* It comes with RTX 2060  GPU and it will run your games on medium to high settings, You can check the below link to see how the  RTX 2060
* GPU  (scroll down for the FPs and settings expected or ctrl+f then type the name of your game).

https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-2060-Laptop-Graphics-Card.384946.0.html

* The outer shell is made almost entirely out of metal.
* Keyboard is mechanical with RGB backlit.
* It has 3 USB type A, Ethernet, and mic and headphone jack and on the back an HDMI, and USB type C.
 
* Screen is IPS with 144Hz refresh rate, with impressively small bezels, and a professional design.
 
* Lid can't be open with one hand.
 
* Fans get loud under intensive work, but that is normal with every good gaming laptop.
 
* Plenty of upgrade options as the chassis supports up to 32GB of ram, and 2 SSDs and 1 HDD.
* Heat management is great, it can get hot but it gets cool again pretty quickly once the fans kick in.
 
* Main con of the laptop is the trackpad, it is mediocre at best when you compare it to other laptops in the price range.
 
* Battery life during normal usage is around 3.5-4.5 hours and 1.5 hour during gaming.
 
* Speakers are down facing so during gaming, it is best to wear headphone since the fan gets loud during gaming as well.

* , 15.6” Full HD,
* AMD Quad Core R5-3500U CPU,
* 8GB DDR4 RAM,
* 256GB PCIe SSD,
* AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics

It has one of the best processors and integrated graphics you can get for this price so it is able to handle editing software and 3d programs well (**for the price**). At 3.5 lbs it is very portable and its power brick is not too heavy either. It has an SSD which is fast and reliable and its 8 GB of RAM does not need to be upgraded unless you have something very intensive tasks ahead"
ffrjrf,"Hi, I agree with the other recommendation, the [**Lenovo ThinkPad E595**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=6xJhMJDSy2I&mid=44583&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-lenovo-thinkpad-e595-20nf0012us-mainstream%2Fp%2F1TS-000E-0DDH8%3FDescription%3Dthinkpad%2520e595%26cm_re%3Dthinkpad_e595-_-1TS-000E-0DDH8-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue) is your kind of device.

* Slim, sleek high-quality case and the aluminum lid gives the Aspire a premium look.
* You can actually rotate the lid back a little beyond 180 degrees, meaning you can lay the laptop completely flat with the lid open.
* It is lightweight for its size at 3.97 lbs
 
* Comes with backlit keyboard, you also get a dedicated numeric keypad with a somewhat narrow design.
* Battery life advertised Up to 7.5-hours Battery Life.
 
* Comes with a range of ports, including HDMI, USB 3.1 & USB 2.0.
 
* You can upgrade SSD and RAM up to 20GB according to this

This device runs Windows 10. It has a 4-core Ryzen 5 processor, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS display. The weight is only 2.55lbs, which is very low considering the specifications of this device. It should be fine for general use and older games. It has a backlit keyboard, USB Type-A, etc. But it lacks USB-C charging and an SD card reader. You might want to consider using dongles since there are port sacrifices in the low budget range."
ffnkw7,So what did you end up getting ? or are you still looking ?
fflkmu,You should look at used machines. Would a Dell m6800 work?  I7 with a video card in it. It’s heavy but a workhorse.
fflkmu,"Hi, if you can move up to around $520, the [**Lenovo ThinkPad E495**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=6xJhMJDSy2I&mid=44583&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-lenovo-thinkpad-e495-20ne0002us%2Fp%2F2WC-000J-008F8%3FDescription%3Dthinkpad%2520e495%26cm_re%3Dthinkpad_e495-_-2WC-000J-008F8-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue) is a good choice. This is a very durable and reliable business grade laptop that comes with a Ryzen 5 processor, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS display, which should be just fine for light gaming and general use. The device is around 4lbs and battery life is around 8 hours for light use. This laptop should definitely last a lot longer than your IdeaPad."
fflkmu,"I would recommend this [Acer Swift 3](http://amazon.com/dp/B07MRWRHGC/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because of the following: 

* The casing made of brushed aluminum and looks very premium.
* The keyboard is a chiclet keyboard, typing on it feels spongy, but you get used to it quickly.
* Drag and drop sometimes doesn't work as intended, but that is easily fixed with software.
 
* Screen is glossy Full HD IPS, with very good viewing angles, the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant (or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive).
 
* The main (and maybe only) con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get, as it is not usable in direct sunlight.
 
* Has very good heat management, and it doesn't throttle.
 
* Speakers provide very clear sounds, and the maximum volume is pretty loud.
 
 
* Battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light to medium usage.

* Comes with  90% sRGB coverage, combined with the matte display coating, the high brightness of almost 300 nits makes for decent outdoor usability in the shade and on overcast days. It is nowhere near bright enough for working in direct sunlight, though.
 
* Good upgradeability (four RAM slots, three storage bays, WWAN) but it’s somewhat complicated (special tools needed for keyboard).

* Intel Core i7-10510U,

* 16GB RAM,
* 512GB PCIe SSD,
* Innovative Screenpad 2.0,

This laptop has a very good build quality and it very future proof. With 16GB of ram and a 10th gen processor, it should last years without getting stale. Its has thin bezels and a nice and bright display. Its premium feel is similar to that of a MackBook or a ThinkPad without the high cost."
ff5ujj,"Hi, the laptops you're looking at aren't 2-in-1 laptops. Are you looking for a 2-in-1 (convertible) laptop?"
ff5ujj,"If you prefer 2 in 1, then I would recommend this [Lenovo Yoga 720](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077X5HWMJ/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you need, 8th generation, i7 quad core CPU, 16GB of ram, good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading, 13.3 inch Full HD IPS touch screen,  high build quality, backlit keyboard, supports pen and thunderbolt port.

 I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review, so here it goes:
 
* It  has an IPS panel with very stable viewing angles. Therefore, the screen content is legible from every position. Under the open sky, the device can only be used when the sun does not shine too brightly, and even then the reflective surface of the display can negatively impact the experience.
 
* Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures, but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components
                              	          	        	                    	                                	                    	        	           
* Good upgrades available, can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles.
 
* It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3.                              	                 
* Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage.
* Minimal bloat-ware, speakers have excellent quality but not so loud, Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards, Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver, It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate, The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

feyrs1,"What you 're asking for is impossible. 

Everything can be done but. BUT. It cannot happen in a thin laptop.

All laptops with an RTX 2060 are thiccbois (very, very thick laptops).

And the red 2060 mobile will NOT give you 100fps at ultra quality only at mid and high. How do I know? I only get 40-60 FPS in RDR2 at very high settings"
feyrs1,"Firstly, I think you should look at what is available to you in your country. Going for those will probably give you more support warranty wise, since purchasing a laptop online and shipping it to Taiwan won't give you the full benefits of warranty as most manufacturers don't offer international coverage. I would recommend going to 光華商場 if you are in Taipei, or visit pchome:  [https://24h.pchome.com.tw/region/DHAA](https://24h.pchome.com.tw/region/DHAA). So you can do the research on that front. In terms of comparing Acer and Asus holistically, the differences are negligible. I do recommend the Asus Scar III or Acer Triton 500 as they both satisfy your needs pretty well and are within your budget if you PURCHASE IN THE US.

I usually don't recommend XPS because they have some quality control issues but Dell has good support and they should replace it shortly if you get a faulty unit. It has a quad-core processor, a beautiful 4k display, PCIe SSD, over 6H battery life, decent peripheral port selection: 3 X USB-C 3.1, Thunderbolt, SD card reader and soldered RAM.

If 6H is not enough for your needs, let me know and I'll try to recommend something with a Full HD display.

It’s hard to beat these specifications for that price, and the 1660ti, although it doesn’t have ray tracing, is very fast and almost on-par with the desktop 1070.

fdvncs,"Lighter weight does increase the price. This is the lightest gaming laptop out there (3.8 lbs and $1499): https://www.amazon.com/Eluktronics-MAX-15-Ultra-Light-Notebook/dp/B083L47SW8

fdvncs,"Hey,

As you can see here: https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-970M-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1050-Ti-Mobile/m17319vsm223242, you're going to need a laptop with at least GTX 1050 TI. GTX 970 is an older but powerful graphics card, I tried to translate into 2018-2020 specs.

Here you can see some options that check most of your requirements: [**search engine**](https://noteb.com/?search/search.php?advsearch=1&Regions%5B%5D=United%20States&bdgminadv=500&bdgmaxadv=1100&exchadv=USD&CPU_msc_id%5B%5D=Intel%20Core%20i7%2Fi9&nrcoresmin=4&nrcoresmax=8&cputdpmin=2&cputdpmax=127&cpufreqmin=1&cpufreqmax=5&cputechmin=7&cputechmax=28&launchdatemin=2012&launchdatemax=2020&gputype=1&gputype2%5B%5D=2&gputype2%5B%5D=4&gpumemmin=64&gpumemmax=16384&gpubusmin=64&gpubusmax=2048&gpulaunchdatemin=2013&gpulaunchdatemax=2020&gpupowermin=10&gpupowermax=300&displaymin=13&displaymax=16.1&verresmin=1080&verresmax=2400&DISPLAY_msc_id%5B%5D=LED%20IPS&DISPLAY_msc_id%5B%5D=LED%20IPS%20PenTile&DISPLAY_msc_id%5B%5D=LED%20TN%20WVA&DISPLAY_msc_id%5B%5D=OLED&DISPLAY_msc_id%5B%5D=80%25%20sRGB%20or%20better&capacitymin=256&capacitymax=8192&nrhdd=1&typehdd%5B%5D=SSD&mdbslots=0&mdbwwan=0&rammin=16&rammax=128&freqmin=1333&freqmax=3733&batlifemin=2&batlifemax=18.5&acumcapmin=25&acumcapmax=102&weightmin=0.4&weightmax=5.6&thicmin=6.9&thicmax=68.9&widthmin=198&widthmax=434.9&depthmin=128&depthmax=420&webmin=0&webmax=8&wnetspeed=150&oddtype=Any%2FNone&opsist%5B%5D=Windows%2010%20Home&opsist%5B%5D=Windows%2010%20Pro&opsist%5B%5D=Windows%2010%20S&opsist%5B%5D=macOS%2010.15&opsist%5B%5D=Chrome%20OS%201&yearsmin=1&yearsmax=3&sort_by=value&ref=starchaser).

For a laptop with good battery life, I'd give this one a chance: [**MSI Prestige PS63**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=3829024469605051531_2750&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) - very light 15.6-inch laptop, has an I7 processor, 4 GB graphics card, display with good color coverage, GTX 1050 TI Max-Q graphics, only SSD as storage, 2 memory slots 16 GB RAM, ~10H battery life and a decent peripheral port selection: 1 X USB-C 3.1, 3 X USB 3.1, MicroSD card reader.

Or, if you want power, this [**Acer Predator Helios 300 15**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=12922079978250000384_2967&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) could be another option - crappy battery life but excellent performance, no thermal issues, great upgrade options and ok build quality. This will make you a gamer if you're not one :D you'll be able to play most AAA games on high settings. 

Hope I helped!"
fdvncs,"Hi, I agree with the other recommendation, the [**MSI PS63 Modern**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=6xJhMJDSy2I&mid=44589&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.ca%2Fmsi-ps-series-ps63-modern-008%2Fp%2FN82E16834155343%3FDescription%3Dmsi%2520ps63%26cm_re%3Dmsi_ps63-_-34-155-343-_-Product) is the best choice when it comes to decent battery life, a low weight, and decent performance all within budget. That combination can be very rare to find. You can expect around 9 hours for light use. Weight is only 1.6kg and the GTX 1050 Ti MQ graphics should be fine for siome light gaming and Adobe programs."

**Comments:** A great value for money gaming laptop with a good heat management system. While it is not able to run AAA titles on high settings it is fully able to run most games and get decent FPS. The main downfall of this laptop is a lack of an SSD but that can easily be added.

fdnizy,"Hi, the best gaming laptop in your price range would have to be the [**HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop**](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1883484/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAcid-FHD-NVIDIA-GDDR5-HP-Shadow-GTX-3-Intel-GeForce-Pavilion-Black-8GB-GB-Core-1050-i5-9300H-SSD-15-dk0068wm-Laptop-Green-256GB-SDRAM-15-6-Gaming%2F578241214). It comes with a 4-core i5 processor, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, GTX 1050 dedicated graphics card, and a 1080p 15.6"" display. This combination should handle those games extremely well."
fdnizy,"I would recommend this [Acer Aspire 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TJ21K7T/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because of the following:
 
* It offers great value for money since it comes with 8 GB RAM and 512GB SSD.

* Slim, sleek.
 
* the lid of the device has a matte finish on its aluminum material. On the other side, the plastic material on the rest of the chassis is retained.
* its lid cannot be opened with a single hand. On the bright side, it is sturdy and prone to flexes. Moreover, we see an upgrade in the hinge department that leaves them a lot stronger than before.
* The narrow-bezel design offers more real estate for amazing images. Crisp, true-to-life colors come alive on a 15.6” Full HD IPS display with Acer Color Intelligence.

And if you prefer more powerful GPU, and can push your budget a little higher, then I would recommend this [Asus TUF FX505DT](https://www.amazon.com/R5-3550H-Processor-Graphics-FX505DT-AH51-Keyboard/dp/B07VBK4SYS/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) mainly because it offers great value for money and with high refresh range (which is very rare for this range), here is a review of it:
 
Specs:
 
* AMD Ryzen 5 R5-3550H Processor, GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, 8GB DDR4, 256GB PCIe SSD.
* It comes with GTX 1650  GPU and it will run   WoW, and Sims on medium to high settings,  You can check the below link to see how the  GTX 1650
* GPU  (scroll down for the FPs and settings expected or ctrl+f then type the name of your game).
https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1650-Laptop-GPU.416044.0.html

* RJ-45, HDMI 2.0, USB 2.0 Type-A, 2x USB Type-A 3.1 Gen
 
Review:
 
* Con: All ports are on one side and it doesn't have USB type C.
* Con: Gets loud fans under heavy load like gaming.
 
* Pro: You can add an additional ram stick and additional 2.5 storage hard drive.
* Pro: Very good build quality and heat management (hot enough to be uncomfortable on your lap but not enough to throttle).
* Pro: Very good battery life up to 7-8 hours during non gaming usage.

* , 15.6” Full HD,
* AMD Quad Core R5-3500U CPU,
* 8GB DDR4 RAM,
* 256GB PCIe SSD,
* AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics

It has one of the best processors and integrated graphics you can get for this price so it is able to handle editing software and 3d programs well (**for the price**). At 3.5 lbs it is very portable and its power brick is not too heavy either. It has an SSD which is fast and reliable and its 8 GB of RAM does not need to be upgraded unless you have something very intensive tasks ahead"
fd5im1,"If you can push your budget a little higher, then I would recommend this [Acer Aspire 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TJ21K7T/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because of the following:
 
* It offers great value for money since it comes with 8 GB RAM and 512GB SSD.
* It comes with 8th Gen, i5 quad core CPU.
* Slim, sleek.
 
* the lid of the device has a matte finish on its aluminum material. On the other side, the plastic material on the rest of the chassis is retained.
* its lid cannot be opened with a single hand. On the bright side, it is sturdy and prone to flexes. Moreover, we see an upgrade in the hinge department that leaves them a lot stronger than before.
*The narrow-bezel design offers more real estate for amazing images. Crisp, true-to-life colors come alive on a 15.6” Full HD IPS display with Acer Color Intelligence.
 
* Battery life advertised Up to 9.5-hours Battery Life.

It improves on all of the factors you mentioned that aren't good about the ASUS Zenbook 13 with 8 GB RAM."
fb5ttb,Just wanna say that you could buy the laptop that you found and just upgrade the RAM yourself.
fb5ttb,"I would recommend this [Lenovo Yoga 720](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077X5HWMJ/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you need, 8th generation, i7 quad core CPU, 16GB of ram, good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading, 13.3 inch Full HD IPS touch screen,  high build quality, backlit keyboard, supports pen, it weighs 2.9lbs which is light like you want, and thunderbolt port.
 I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review, so here it goes:
 
* It  has an IPS panel with very stable viewing angles. Therefore, the screen content is legible from every position. Under the open sky, the device can only be used when the sun does not shine too brightly, and even then the reflective surface of the display can negatively impact the experience.
 
* Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures, but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components
 	                           	                    	                    	                    	                                	                    	        	           
* Good upgrades available, can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles.
 
* It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3.              		                    	                 
* Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage.
* Minimal bloat-ware, speakers have excellent quality but not so loud, Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards, Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver, It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate, The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

And if you prefer dedicated GPU and would be okay with 15.6 inch screen, then I would recommend this [Acer Spin 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRGNXB6/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) since it matches most of your requirements, as it has a full HD screen, comes with 8th gen, i7 quad core CPU, comes with  USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0 / 3.1 Gen1, 1 HDMI, Card Reader: SD, and 1x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, long battery life Up to 10-hours, and the case is made predominantly of aluminium, and supports an input pen that can be used for the touchscreen, such as the Acer Stylus Pen, and it’s within your budget.

* Easily upgradeable, removing the back panel gives you access to 2 ram slots that can support up to 64GB ram, the Wifi card if you want to change, 2 NVMe cards, and one of the biggest battery capacity at 93W/H.
* Screen is 144 HZ IPS with high color accuracy 96% RGP and 73% sRGB with up to 290 nt brightness.
* Bezels are pretty thin, camera is up top.
* Keyboard is mechanical but it needs time to get used to it.
* Heat management is great, and it comes undervolted so you can play with that if you need more CPU power.

I'd recommend configuring it with a quad-core Ryzen 5 processor, 400 Nits display, 8 GB RAM and an SSD - I'd opt for a small SSD combined with an HDD - saves some money.

favj2k,"I recommend the [Lenovo Yoga C740](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/epp_cocacola/laptops/yoga/700-series/Lenovo-Yoga-C740-14/p/88YGC701292) or the [Pavilion x360 15t](https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?catalogId=10051&langId=-1&storeId=10151&urlLangId=&catEntryId=3074457345619384325&quantity=1)

The Yoga has better build quality and better battery life, which are essential to a college student, but it also has less RAM than the HP and its RAM is not upgradeable.

Personally, I'd go with the Yoga."

For a low-budget option, she can check out this: [**HP Envy x360 15**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=17365890884123000832_3074&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) - quad-core Ryzen processor, Vega 8 integrated graphics, display with good color coverage 90% sRGB but not that bright: 220 Nits, PCIe SSD, 2 memory slots, ~9H battery life, and a decent peripheral port selection: 1 X USB-C 3.1, 2 X USB 3.1, SD card reader.

It provides decent performance for a 2-in-1 laptop, a low weight, and a touchscreen display. Its Ryzen 5 processor and Vega 8 graphics combination should be just fine for some light gaming.

favj2k,"Since your sister wants a touch screen, I would recommend this [Acer Spin 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRGNXB6/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) since it matches most of your requirements, as it has a full HD screen, comes with 8th gen, i7 quad core CPU, comes with  USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0 / 3.1 Gen1, 1 HDMI, Card Reader: SD, and 1x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, long battery life Up to 10-hours, and the case is made predominantly of aluminium, and supports an input pen that can be used for the touchscreen, such as the Acer Stylus Pen, and it’s a within your budget.

fazpal,"Hey,

There are some 2in1 laptops in your budget but please keep in mind that low-budget laptops usually do not have the best build quality or reliability. They are not bad machines, just that you should not expect them to last very long.

It comes with a Ryzen 5 processor, 8 GB RAM, and a 256 GB SSD, which is a good combination for general use and some light gaming. 

If you want a more expensive option, the [**Lenovo Yoga C740**](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FLenovo-Yoga-C740-2-in-1-14-Touch-Screen-Laptop-Intel-Core-i5-8GB-Memor-%2F202807946667%3Fhash%3Ditem2f384badab&campid=5338636961&toolid=20008) is overall more of a premium feeling device: better build quality, lighter, and a nicer design."
fazpal,"If you can push your budget a little higher, then I would recommend this [Lenovo Yoga 720](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076V6DPZN/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you need, 8th generation, i5 quad core CPU, 8GB of ram, good SSD storage of 256GB for faster boot up and loading, 13.3 inch Full HD IPS touch screen,  high build quality, backlit keyboard, supports pen, and thunderbolt port.

 I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review, so here it goes:
 
* It  has an IPS panel with very stable viewing angles. Therefore, the screen content is legible from every position. Under the open sky, the device can only be used when the sun does not shine too brightly, and even then the reflective surface of the display can negatively impact the experience.
   	                  	  
* Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures, but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components
       	                                             	                    	        	        	        	                    	                    	        	           
* Good upgrades available, can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles.
 
* It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3.  		        	                    	        	                                    	                                	                                                        	                 
* Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming like you want.
* Minimal bloat-ware, speakers have excellent quality but not so loud, Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards, Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver, It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate, The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

favly2,Acer Predator Helios 300 is your best bet. Offers solid performance with not many sacrifices. Little over your budget though.
favly2,"https://www.microcenter.com/product/610074/maingear-vector-156-gaming-laptop-computer
Doesn't have 2.5"" slot so no space for HDD (taken by large battery) but there's empty M.2 slot

Evoo gaming 15"" from Walmart is same laptop but has smaller battery and 2.5"" slot

Other than these two. Get Helios 300."
favly2,"Hey,

An excellent option for your needs was already been mentioned: [**Acer Predator Helios 300 15**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=12922079978250000384_2967&ex=USD&ref=starchaser).

I know it comes with only 256 SSD but it has room for another SSD and an HDD so you can upgrade it yourself. It's not very hard to do it - see some tutorials online (it will be much cheaper).

I'm recommending this laptop because it has excellent thermals, offers powerful specs for your money: six-core processor, GTX 1660 Ti, 144Hz display, PCIe SSD and 16 GB RAM and it also has a decent build quality. We had this laptop for testing and here are some drawbacks: gets very loud under heavy load, crappy battery life, and some backlit bleeding on the display but nothing serious.

* It has 3 USB type A, Ethernet, and mic and headphone jack and on the back an HDMI, and USB type C.
 
* Screen is IPS with 144Hz refresh rate, with impressively small bezels, and a professional design.
 
* Lid can't be open with one hand.
 
* Fans get loud under intensive work, but that is normal with every good gaming laptop.
 
* Plenty of upgrade options as the chassis supports up to 32GB of ram, and 2 SSDs and 1 HDD.
* Heat management is great, it can get hot but it gets cool again pretty quickly once the fans kick in.
 
* Main con of the laptop is the trackpad, it is mediocre at best when you compare it to other laptops in the price range.
 
* Battery life during normal usage is around 3.5-4.5 hours and 1.5 hour during gaming.
 
* Speakers are down facing so during gaming, it is best to wear headphone since the fan gets loud during gaming as well.

fa7oqk,"Unless there is a specific program your program uses that is specific to apple, if you can't afford a macbook I'd get something else. I like the OS better, but having a decent CPU, at least 16 GB ram, and some GPU is more important than having the OS your friends use. If you go older and refurbished you're probably going to end up with something underpowered and starving for RAM again."
fa7oqk,"Hey,

I totally agree with the other Redditors, unless you really need it for a specific program it's not the best option for your needs. Everybody else is using it - not the best argument here.

If you're willing to choose a Windows laptop you'll get better specs for the money and, on most laptops, the chance to upgrade them later.

Can you please fill the [**form**](https://old.reddit.com/r/suggestalaptop/wiki/form?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=SuggestALaptop&utm_content=t5_2s4k5) so we can try to recommend something else?

Or, if you decide on getting a new Windows laptop, maybe you can play around with our [**quizz**](https://noteb.com/?content/home.php?ref=starchaser)"
fa7oqk,If you do decide to get a Mac don’t bother with getting a used one. People ask too high of prices for computers that most likely have been dropped inside of back packs and have had stuff spilt on them. The refurbished models are a great option to buy directly from Apple. I’d wait until Apple refreshes their 13” model with the old style keyboard that they put back into the larger MacBook Pro.
fa7oqk,"Get a 15"" from at least Late 2013. The Late 2013, Mid 2014 and Mid 2015 all share the same Haswell quad-core i7 CPUs and (except the base model 2013) they have 16GB of RAM and a Retina display.

Avoid the 2012/Early 2013 because they have common GPU failures and avoid all the 13"" because they're underpowered.

And avoid all the 2016/2017 as well because they're just hot garbage.

As other people have said though, if you don't a have some specific reasons to get a mac, just buy a Windows machine."
fa7oqk,dont get a macbook
fa7oqk,get a thinkpad x230 and install hackintosh on it
fa7oqk,anything from 2014 on should be fine.
fa7oqk,"I have a mid 2014 15” MacBook Pro, and 3 years after purchase I had to drop $600 on a new logic board because it was overheating. The issue cropped up after 2 years, but I installed a fan controller app and started running fans at max rpm whenever I did anything related to video, including things that should be low intensity like YouTube or Netflix. It was a band aid solution that eventually wasn’t good enough.

Just know that these things aren’t built with good thermals. They have a case that’s built like a tank, excellent battery life and strong Wi-Fi cards, but those internals are cooking if you’re doing anything other than light web browsing, word processing and email."
fa7oqk,If you haven’t bought anything yet woot is selling refurbished 2017 and 2018 MacBooks for as low as $700.
faifqz,"Hey,

> Would like true colors and dedicated graphics card with at least 4GB Video Memory and at least 8GB RAM for computer but preferably 16.

>  Up to 500$ but prefer 400$. In the USA.

I'm not trying to be rude but these are not realistic requirements in your budget. 

A laptop with a good display starts from 600$ and it doesn't have a dedicated graphics card. A laptop with 4 GB graphics card starts from 600$ and it doesn't have a good display. A laptop with a 4GB graphics card and good display starts from 800$.

faifqz,"Hi, are you willing to increase budget? The other comment is right, you'll need to spend more for a good display."

And if you can push your budget higher, then I would recommend this [Asus TUF FX505DT](https://www.amazon.com/R5-3550H-Processor-Graphics-FX505DT-AH51-Keyboard/dp/B07VBK4SYS/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) mainly because it offers great value for money and with high refresh range (which is very rare for this range), here is a review of it:

fadvtn,"Hey,

Please keep in mind that low-budget laptops usually do not have the best build quality or reliability. They are not bad machines, just that you should not expect them to last very long.

That's why I'd strongly recommend considering a refurbished business-grade laptop. Tigerdirect has a good selection: [**affiliated link**](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/search.asp?cat=17&keywords=thinkpad&highprice=499.99&catDesc=Laptops+%2F+Notebooks&lowprice=200&SRCCODE=3WCJ&utm_source=cj&utm_content=8789727&utm_term=12612265&cjevent=b1bc3f0b5a2311ea829e00e50a18050d).

fgnys6,It probably doesn’t recognise the hardware properly given the OS is unsupported on that MacBook Pro model
fgnys6,OT - hows that MBPs performance? Im guessing its a 2006 model.
fgnys6,Have you tried it in the dark?
fgnys6,What are your keyboard settings like? Maybe you turned it off accidentally
fgnys6,But for me is option is just not there and the laptop thinks there is no backlight. I’m not sure what’s happening.
fgnys6,I would say because you're running Catalina on an unsupported Mac.

ffr61t,it is ALIVEEEEEEE!
ffr61t,It’s like a reverse iMac
ffr61t,How did you make it so the macbook boots up and uses the hdmi as the main screen? I planned on doing this set up with an old macbook but it doesnt use the hdmi cable until i select the account and type in the password (which is really hard with a dead screen)
ffr61t,Smithing: 100
ffr61t,Woah that's interesting
ffr61t,How did you do that.

ffr61t,That’s dope man...
ffr61t,Which model is it specifically?
ffr61t,Is that an Ikea wall mounted speaker?
ffr61t,So u just mirror the screen in settings?
ffr61t,That’s making my MBP 2009 very very old 😂
ffr61t,Like the Apple 1
ffr61t,I know he bought this like this. Anyone know of a how-to guide to do this?
ffr61t,HeadOn! Apply directly to the forehead.
ffr61t,it’s the non retina version

If you have an IT department have them run a malware check with MalwareBytes or EtreCheck. Both will identify rogue software activity and offer a paid component to actively scan your computer. I like MalwareBytes as it will remove rogue software interactively, EtreCheck requires a little more work."

ffaks2,"For what you need an i5 is enough. Of course an i9 would be an improvement but depends on how low you’re on budget. For the fusion drive, I have one on my iMacs and it performs good. Not as good as a plain ssd but much faster than a regular hdd."
ffaks2,I would suggest getting an SSD instead of the fusion drive. It’s much more future proof and much much quicker.
ffaks2,I5 sounds fine for your needs. I’d check out https://www.parallels.com/uk/products/desktop/pro/ for the Windows OS option though. Great product.
ffaks2,"There‘s this easy rule of thumb: when you don’t know, go for the lower spec. You‘ll know when you‘d need the i9.

And go with the SSD. Fusion Drives were OK in 2012/2013, nowadays SSD only. You can always attach HDD when you need more storage."
ffaks2,Definitely go for ssd. Hybrid drives are obsolete. Apple only sells them for price discrimination purposes.
ffaks2,"Pure SSD (rather than Fusion Drive) will make more of a difference for your uses than the i5 -> i9 jump. Photoshop and Lightroom aren't that CPU intensive.

Boot Camp is basically just native dual-booting. If you don't need 100% native performance for your Windows work, you'll be fine with a VM."
ffaks2,"Another vote for pure SSD. Also, if one part of Fusion Drive fails (SSD part or HDD part), whole Fusion Disk will fail."
ffaks2,"Definitely go for the SSD

I'd say go for the i9, as it gives two extra chores and makes it better near iMac pro replacement"
ffaks2,"Thank you for the suggestions - sounds as if my wallet is going to have to take the strain :-)  SSD, external drive in a nice fancy case and i9 it will be!"

feb7g8,That is so dangerous for a factory no backup system on a system that should have been recapped several times

feb7g8,"Impressive workhorse. But in a way also makes me sad that this old machine they rely upon isn't cleaned and/or maintained. It's obviously critical to their business.

How hard is it to treat this relic with some TLC? Wipe the computer case down, clean or vacuum the keybaord... just show it an ounce of love and it'll probably run another 40 years."
feb7g8,"Beauty.

I programmed in Fortran 77 and Engineering Physics classes on one of these babies in '88 and '89 (Pascal and Basic were done on an HP mainframe, using punch cards - ugh). Toting around those floppies, guarding them with my life. I can still see the green screen of the Apple display that's missing here in my dreams...

ff1wi5,"1.	 Not yet.  The iOS apps on iPhine and iPadOS apps on the iPad aren’t usable on the Mac, but Apple has announced that they are working on making them usable on the Mac.  Could be ready soon.
2.	I think if you sync your Dropbox to the Mac hard drive, you can then use your Dropbox like it was a folder on your hard drive.  But you could consider using Microsoft OneDrive in place of Dropbox.  It basically works the same way.


Congratulations on the new Mac!  I love mine."
felak3,Jeez...Only 2GB RAM?
felak3,Got an ssd in there?
fee7ep,"Base model has 8GB RAM and Fusion Drive, you don't want that. Get one with 16GB and a SSD. You'll probably need a 1TB SSD if you are dealing with large video files.  The best consumer card they offer is the Radeon Pro 580X and it's only available on the high end model. You can upgrade to a Vega but it's a lot of money and I'm sure you don't need that (Or do you? Are you a professional? if so max out and claim on expenses)

Apparently new iMacs are going to be released soon so maybe you should wait though."
fee7ep,"I'll second the ""wait"" recommendation by u/pepe612 \- the next generation of Intel chipsets are better optimized for this kind of processing. We'll know more in just a few weeks...

Not just piling on, are you using a fast external media cache scratch disk - if not, you should be. Get your caching onto another data bus. I use a base iMP, the rendering speed differences with a fast SSD attached for caching is palpable..."

fe1t4x,"Have you already tried clicking on reader view? (It's a very hard to notice icon in the browser bar when u place your mouse pointer in the browser bar, usually to the far left..it's an icon with 3 or 4 lines stacked). You can enable reader mode for specific sited too...I just don't know the path right this moment."
fdsjyk,open it up and disconnect the lcd cable
fdsjyk,"Take out the drive...which ever type of drive it is, buy an external casing or usb connector for that drive. Plugin to another mac and copy it off..."
fdsjyk,"You shouldn't need to jump through a lot of hoops to get an external monitor to work, although I'm confused by the ""press enter to use english..."" message. That part is displayed properly? I'm also not sure what that message would be from. It's not a part of the normal startup procedure.

Anyway, it's possible something is wrong with the graphics card and that is affecting both the internal and external display. If you have another mac and a thunderbolt cable you could try [Target Disk Mode](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/transfer-files-mac-computers-target-disk-mode-mchlp1443/mac). Or you can remove the SSD and put it in an enclosure and then try and read that."
fdsjyk,If is asking about english then a new os x install was done recently. That is the first step in the setup part of the install. Tbh depending on how that reinstall was done there may no longer be any user files to copy off the internal drive. Before going further you more info about what was done.
fdsjyk,Connect it to another Mac and start it up in target disc mode. Hold T at start.
fdrmss,"I would be utterly shocked if they made any changes to the 16"" before the second half of the year."
fdrmss,I think what Apple would be announcing is only for the 14.1” replacement for the current 13”. The 16” that they just launched last year will most likely remain untouched.
fdrmss,"I own a small company that uses both Mac and Win laptops. Rumors come and go. Intel announced its new 10-gen CPUs months ago, there's an Apple event in 3 weeks.

I'm waiting..."
fdrmss,"4 months after the initial release of the 16"" Apple won't kill its sales by announcing an updated version already.

i.e. I recommend going for it now. Unless you want to wait until November to get a new laptop anyway, as that would be the time I'd expect the annual update for the 16"" MBP."
fdr8bg,You do release at the end of 10.12 Apple starred warnings about apps like that built into the OS.  I think 2+ years is ample warning to prep with a VM or bootcamp.

fak6s9,The rails are ~1 cm too long and therefore do not fit racks that are 600 mm deep.
fak6s9,"600mm is 23.622"", juuust shy of the technical specs for the rails.

To install Mac Pro into a rack, you need to attach the rail assemblies to Mac Pro and the rack. The minimum depth of the rack must be at least 24 inches; the maximum depth should be no more than 42 inches."

f9tsi4,"My two cores are running 175-190ºF, but it's not just browsing that's happening, of course; I have mail running, a few sync services, iTunes is in the background, etc."
f9tsi4,Why does it matter?
f9h346,I think you should upgrade to an SSD first
f9h346,First check the compatibility of the applications you use.
f9h346,"No.  Don’t upgrade this Mac.  Your performance will suffer.  Swap in an SSD instead, you’ll see an insane bump in performance."
f9h346,"Don’t do it! You can’t start other os from a external drive anymore, there is no 32 bit support, you can’t install an older mac version. Catalina is a arrogant bitch. Go to the latest mac os that supports 32 bit."
f9h346,Definitely not. If anything I’d be downgrading it to Snow Leopard. El Cap runs like absolute crap on any of these older Macs from 2007 - 2010. Snow Leopard is rock solid and one of the best releases of OS X. El Capitan is probably one of the worst next to Lion and High Sierra both being crap.
f9h346,I am very satisfied. So yes!
f9h346,Another issue to consider is the different font smoothing. Fonts look not great starting with Mojave if you don't have a Retina display. I have a 2012 MBA and went back to High Sierra for that reason.
f9h346,"If you want your 32bit apps to run, dont install it. But if the version you have works fine, why update it?"
f9h346,"Nope, one of the things that kill me about Catalina is that they removed iTunes. I basically lived in iTunes...it was my home. I’m not upgrading my Mac to it at all. The reason I like it is because of the screen time on there but no."
f9h346,"Absolutely not. I downgraded to High Sierra to get my performance back.  
I do not recommend it."
f9h346,I’d upgrade to an ssd and at least 8gb ram if u want a smooth experience
f9h346,I miss Nvidia Macs :(
f9h346,High Sierra should run okay on this but I wouldn't go any higher than that.
f9h346,I have the same model (but running 8gb ram) and High Sierra works perfectly fine. Wouldn’t even dream of Catalina though.
f9h346,"As others have said, no, largely because Mojave and up don't (natively) support Nvidia GPU acceleration, so your graphics will be...*subpar* to say the least. In addition, I believe that APFS, the new file system version, does not play nicely with mechanical hard drives."
f9h346,"People saying you should upgrade to Catalina doesn’t have a single clue honestly! (my 2011 Air didn’t even do well with Mojave for f*cks sake!)

SSD and more ram is the way to go.

Maybe Sierra later on."
f9h346,"You can't upgrade to Catalina. The Mac model is too old. The oldest models that can run Catalina are from 2012. Max for this model would be El Capitan, so you can't update further."
f9h346,"Have a look at upgrading the RAM to 8 if you can for sure, but the main issue is that HDD.

Before you jump the gun, look at getting an SSD first and see your improvement. You may find that Catalina would run fine provided you adhere to possible changes in speed."
f9h346,"IMO, at least wait for the next incremental update.

Yes, it's worth it. I'm beta testing the dev builds, there are some low-level changes in the OS relative to encryption. There are still WindowServer-related freezes to be worked out.

You would also be facing a completely new file system - APFS. Also, keep in mind that Apple hasn't updated its NVIDIA drivers in several years, and your Mac does not support Metal."
f9h346,"When I patched up to Mojave on my 2008 iMac it was damn near unusable, even on an external ssd. Granted that only had 6GB ram but if the core 2 duo struggled on Mojave I wouldn’t dare try Catalina, especially since I think it turns the file system to apfs"
f9h346,SSD + 16GB RAM and it will be good for a while longer..... just don't upgrade the OS.
f9h346,dont
f9h346,I don’t think it is I would go to Mojave’s then u have 32 bit app support
f9h346,Yes? Also get an SSD.
f98h0g,MacBooks are great Investments. Mine is still going strong as well.
f98h0g,That's not the best deal but not gonna stop me from upvoting.
f98h0g,Is that a Retina ?  My first Mac was a 2012 Retina when Retinas first came out and it was such a great machine.  Had mine for 6 years and it ran and looked like new.  I got lured in with the MBP when the touchbar came out and sold the retina in 2018 but wish I had just kept the 2012 retina
f98h0g,Probably in the cleanest condition I've ever seen
f98h0g,Have you been able to run the latest OS?
f98h0g,How's the anti reflective display coating looking?
f98h0g,My 2016 MacBook Pro still runs as good as it did day 1.... cant say the same for a plastic PC lol.
f9e73j,Don't buy from cex. Whathever you buy will probably be broken af.

f9e73j,No
f9e73j,Just hoping onto *regionally local ebay* .. it's not amazing.
f9e73j,You could probably find a better deal if you looked around more. But it’s a decent machine. Desirable for the keyboard. And that generation intel chip still holds up decently today.
f9e73j,"CEX is a ripoff, never buy from them or sell to them."
f9e73j,Yes. It’s a good deal since you said it’s a mid 2015. Just to note I bought my early 2015 MacBook Pro from Cex in 2017 and it’s been a wonder product. People who say it’s a ripoff obviously don’t know the deal. Yes the computer is more expensive than eBay/gumtree because every product (expensive like an iMac or cheap like a DVD) have a 2 year warranty. The first 6 months have a full refund if they can’t fix a problem and after that it’s a refund to the current value. As I say my MacBook is brilliant and I’ve not had a problem yet. So go for it!!
f9e73j,no

f99ufq,"Use istat menu (or tg pro or hwsensor) with intel power gadget to determine the cause. Check cpu frequency and all temperature sensors on it. (Sometimes damage can make sensor read insane value like 127 degrees c)

You can also check for any process that might be consuming the cpu as well.

If the cpu is throttled it will run at about 800mhz. So it will be cripplingly slow"
f99ufq,"Cpu speed looks fine (2.4-2.6 ghz) but it might have to do with GPU reaching ~75c.

It happens to all macbooks with discrete graphics, when the gpu gets “too hot”, it ramps the fans. And then maybe reduce gpu clock seed as well as cpu sometimes.

This will happen when dGPU is active. In this case it is, as external display is connected. 

This is also a problem on new 16” macbooks as well (when display are connected it turns on dgpu, and run hotter)

From my own experience tinkering with this model (2015 15” top model) the GPU will crash if it goes beyond 80c
(At least on bootcamp, i used msi afterburner). So Apple might just set paranoid fan curve to prevent GPU dying.

When gpu goes near 60c it will ramp the fan. Then maxing it after going past 65c.

Try forcing the macbook to use only integrated graphics using gfxcardstatus to see if the problem went away. Note that this will make it unable to connect to external display until you put it back in automatic graphic switching.

From The screenshot I saw some gpu load before you took the screenshot. That might be the culprit.

Another possibility is that if the macbook has been messed with around the webcam connector area, it will mess up the trace of the path between smc and the sensor reporting gpu temp and trigger the throttle. (The interference on the smc data line talking to the gpu die sensor)

If this is the case you will see temp intermittently spiked to 110c on gpu die. (Check this with hwsensor)

But this is unlikely. Though you can try to see if it fix it via disconnecting webcam connector.

Edit - sry for listing the temp in celsius. Im used to it more"
f99ufq,"Did you take a look inside for dust? Its out of warranty anyways, consider opening it up (cleaning mine‘s fans every 2 months or so, worth it every time)."
f9337a,"Intel Power Gadget only shows the power draw of, well, the CPU. But there's also power draw from the display, the RAM, the GPU, the fans, charging the battery, etc.

Typically the display is gonna be the biggest power draw, depending on brightness."
f9337a,"You are absolutely correct that DC to AC to DC is very inefficient. You lose a sizable percentage of energy trying to do this. DC to DC is the way to do it. There are two places where I've bought gear that'll power my Magsafe 2 devices off external batteries in as efficient a manner as possible. One is [https://mikegyver.com](https://mikegyver.com) and the other is [https://voltaicsystems.com](https://voltaicsystems.com)

Both sources harvest the Magsafe connectors from 'donor' OEM Apple chargers, as Magsafe isn't licensed for manufacture by anyone other than Apple (this said, I do have an AC charger from Amazon with a non-OEM Magsafe connector on it and it works fine).

As for the power disparity, a 2015 MBP 15"" is built more for performance than thrifty battery consumption. I have one, so I sympathize. When I run battery out in the world, I usually step down to a MacBook Air. But, if the MBP is the right or the available choice, run with the screen dimmed as far as you can stand, don't plug in any external monitors (it'll fire up the M370X GPU, if so equipped and you'll lose another 45W or so), and only have graphics-intensive apps active for the time that you need them (same thing to avoid the GPU). Taking the big charger brick out of the loop by running off of a DC-DC box will help."
f91bla,That usually means it can’t find an OS. Have you installed MacOS onto the SSD yet?
f91bla,"You need to format the SSD and reinstall macOS. The new SSD has no operating system on it. You can do this using macOS Recovery as described by Apple here https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204904. 

If you have a Time Machine backup you can restore from that else you can plug in your old hard drive via usb and use Migration Assistant during the initial setup to migrate from the old drive."
f91bla,"install macOS LOL
do you think new ssd will magically have OS in it?"
ffzbi6,"I would recommend re-imaging. If you have another computer handy I would recommend using the Dell OS Recovery Tool. This will allow you to re-install whatever OS came with the laptop.

few4uq,"I bought dell 2 years ago i have never bought the gaming laptop before so I thought dell is good because its was lower in price as compared to others but after few months it’s started having thermal issues then when it had 4 months left on warranty then AC adapter failed, it wasn’t providing enough voltages sent the laptop for service they wasted my 2 months but never got replacement said the part isn’t available lol then i bought the new adapter myself now it’s working perfectly. I won’t buy dell again because bad thermals, no fan control, shit support"
few4uq,Customer support is horrible I agree
fekznl,"Hi,

Did you contact the Dell technical support team, since this happened right after the service?
If you haven't done so, then here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try doing by yourself, It saves time and effort of going to anyone else for this issue.

-  Run the diagnostics and let us know if the fan noise can be heard during the test.
How to run diagnostics? Refer the link-
https://dell.to/38vwk58 

If there are no errors shown, then let’s check if the hard drive is detected in the BIOS. You can watch a video here https://dell.to/3aABzlC for instructions
Reset the BIOS to defaults. You can watch a video here https://dell.to/32VoccQ for instructions.

Let us know your findings.

^KP"
fekznl,"Please ignore the part where we had asked to check for fan noise issue. This issue is mainly to do with the hard drive.

^KP"
fekznl,"Thanks for responding so quick! It says there is nothing for M2 Sata and M2 PCI SSD-0. I ran the diagnostics and it said everything worked, but there was a hard drive test pop-up that I declined, which said it would take around 3h 45m to complete. It also isn’t recognizing the charger still, which is why I sent it in to you guys in the beginning. I reset the BIOS as well and nothing seemed to work. A few of my friends said they think the hard drive isn’t plugged in after I explained everything to them, though obviously you guys know more.

Edit: Update! Now I can get into my computer, but it still isn’t charging which is why I sent it in earlier. My computer is also slowly running out of battery, which scares me. Please let me know what further steps should be taken when you get the chance"
fe6p67,I second this.  Excellent advice!  I had noticed Smartbyte's B.S. some time ago and removed it as well.  I wonder what other Dell crapware I should be looking to remove.  It's no wonder that the linux partition runs so much faster than Win10.  I know I'm comparing apples and oranges.
fe6p67,"It's just there so Dell can charge hundreds of dollars to remove it, and then not actually remove it after you pay."
fe6y8a,"I’m awaiting delivery of that same pc but with the I7 and 16gb ram. Dell Australia are doing a 20% discount at the moment so I saved around $500, I would struggle to buy the hardware and build it at that price!"

fe0sak,"You dont even need afterburner to be running for the undervolt to be in effect..

Just apply it and close it."
fe0sak,"That's why I don't recommend most people undervolting their GPUs, because it requires afterburner to be on which keeps the GPU on."

Had Dell replace them (the pens), they work okay at first then a few weeks later they start doing this sort of thing. I'm pretty sure it's the pen and not the computers. The worst part is it's really hit or miss finding another brand pen that will work with the Dells."
fdj74r,"windows is set to turn on battery saver automatically at 20% which significantly throttles performance. it’s under settings > system > battery. set ‘enable battery saver at xx%’ or however it’s worded to ‘never’ and you should be good to go 👍

edit: you can temporarily disable battery saver for the current uncharged period by clicking the battery icon in the taskbar and sliding the slider away from ‘battery saver’"
fdj74r,"Hi,

I'm Gopal from Dell social media support. I would like to help you out here

I have a couple of questions to understand the issue better: 
1. How long have you been facing the issue?
2. Have you made any recent hardware/software changes to the system? 
3. Have you contacted our technicial support team regarding this issue?
4. Could you share the system service tag via private message for me to assist you better?"
fdj0j3,"the UHD 620 doesn’t support cod modern warfare; it’s an integrated graphics chip . in fact even the xps 15 with 1650 barely scrapes the minimum requirements for gpu. sorry buddy

if you really want to game on this laptop you’ll have to get an eGPU"
fdj0j3,"Hi,

I'm Gopal from Dell social media support. 

Are you getting the error message only while working on Modern warfare?

Have you contacted our technicial support regarding this issue?

Could you share the system service tag via private message for me to assist you better?"
fdj0j3,Get a better laptop with a dedicated gpu lol
fd3w54,Dammn the thermal solution must not be great.
fd3w54,Love the 1500 € price point for 8 GB RAM / 256 GB SSD as well. Like Apple did in 2017.
fd3w54,Thought it had the same options as the 7390 2 in 1 and those CPU run really well at that size.
fd3w54,"Maybe it's a BIOS issue? The 2 in 1 doesn't throttle that much, how is this possible?"
fcrz5y,Aren’t the keyboards different on both laptops? I heard 9300 has better keyboard.
fcrz5y,"it's the same hardware as the 7300 but with the added bonus of using as a 2 in 1 screen wise is down to personal preference and price of course 4k gives reduction in battery life but a really stunning display the fullHD not quite as nice display but longer battery life.

Personally I have the 4k+ i7 16GB and 512GB ssd."
fcrz5y,"I have the 2 in 1 and the touch screen is quite nice to have, if that's something you think you would use and it's just more readily available at the moment. the 9300 does have a replacable ssd though, which in my opinion is its biggest advantage."
fcrz5y,2 in 1 hands down
fbtuuk,bring it into a dell service store and have them replace the screen for you if it is in warranty. If not you could order a replacement screen and repair it yourself or bring it to a third party repair store to repair it for you.
fbtuuk,I thought this was a Dell Bat-signal
fbtuuk,"It's called LCD light bleed or backlight bleed. It's very common and not just an issue with Dell. Here is a YouTube video and an article.

fbyn2x,"Based on the reviews for the 2in1s and user reviews on the new XPS, YES coil while is still a problem."
fbyn2x,"I have the 2-in-1 and mine has no noticeable coil whine. Really satistifed with the build quality and overall performance.

If there's a store that sells it near you that has a good return policy, you should consider trying it out to see if you are satisfied with it."
fbyn2x,"Had 2 9360's for my first XPS models (mine and dads) neither had coil whine for us at all even after seeing tons of comments about that prior to ordering.

My current 9380 model, which had an annoying whine at the start from the fans kicking up.  After installing the Dell Power Manager and setting Thermal Management to Quiet.

Also having to disable Intel Turbo Boost in the BIOS (even for a tech folk myself, I was out of options and had to call support Pakistan Support) which disabling did that did seem solve the issue."
fbyn2x,Have a Dell Outlet Refurb 7390 2-in-1; not a single issue with it (other than how bad Dell rapes you for and extra 512Gb of NVMe!)
fbyn2x,"I am sending my dell xps second time back to service. First time fans were making wierd noises and battery died(or connector on motherboard). One month later I am sending it again, keyboard backlight is not working. Also after first service one of the screws was handled incorrectly and it looks totaly worn out, I wonder how will they open it now :/

Anyway each time you send it to the service you are without laptop for atleast 2 weeks(I am freelancer by the way). Cannot belive that this is happening to such expensive laptops"
fbyn2x,Literally every single XPS 13 I've ever handled has had coil whine.
fblipf,Measure what size screw it is and try tap the next size up and buy a new screw
fblipf,Yeah that's what happens with mine too. I believe in the same spot too. Can't really do much about it tbh.
fblipf,"If you look on the screw you will likely see a bit of residual blue substance on it. 

This is medium strength removable thread lock that is applied to the screws at the time the laptop is built. It's just probably not had quite enough added to that screw. 

If you buy some and add a small amount to any of the screws that are loose or falling out you will be all sorted. You just need to make sure you get the correct strength and colour (Medium/Removable Blue) and you'll be set.

The attached pic shows the different types of thread lock you can get (Obviously you can get different brands as well which potentially may be different colour!/?).

https://i.imgur.com/oNJnWak.jpg

I'd definitely recommend this over messing with next size screws/lengths, slithers of wood or bits of blu-tack etc. All of which can easily become problematic and a cause headaches.

Hopefully this helps anyone having this issue."
fblipf,"Before doing any of the suggested fixes, take the bottomed cover off and see what you're working with. Take a picture of the inside where the screw is supposed to go and you may get better answers. Often times it is a grommet that is come free of the plastic inside."
fblipf,"Add a sliver of toothpick to the hole, then screw it back in."
fblipf,Screw it!
fblipf,Tap a new thread. Should be super easy with the aluminum case.
fblipf,That happened to my 9360 a lot. Some are already missing.
fblipf,ugh for mine the screw stripped and i can't screw it out :(
fblipf,Try getting a warranty fix. Did that and dell send a technician down to swap the entire base of the xps 15.
fblipf,"Unfortunately, I believe this is an issue with Dell's thread design. On my precision 5520 I have to tighten up the screws every 4 months or so, and on my xps 15 I've lost 1 and a few others have been close!"
fblipf,"My 9530 ran fine on about half the screws.  
I have been more careful with my 9570 and it's got all of them."
fblipf,"I have an opposite issue, cant remove 4 screws at all, i either strip them or the bit/driver... cant clean and repaste the thing"
fblipf,You sure the screw isn’t stripped? Also stuffing a small piece of cotton in there and then screw it in. It should make the hole a tighter fit for the screw.
fblipf,Super glue and let it sit....
fblipf,"A new palm rest/deck is about 20 bucks on ebay. I would really suggest that instead of trying to retap or anything, both for longevity and for lower probability of fucking something up.

Which model is it? I can probably find a part number for you"
fblipf,Buy a thinkpad
fbkzzd,Did you say that you’re gonna have a tech come out? If it was for me I would send it back for a new one not have it fixed after just receiving it. Just my opinion
fbkzzd,"Don't TB devices need to authenticate? I'm no Windows expert, but check your notification tray for a query, just-in-case."
fbkzzd,"Based on my experience with using a thunderbolt dock,

Check:
1. Install thunderbolt driver (again)
2. Install thunderbolt firmware update (also on dell support sirr)
3. Make sure thunderbolt control center thing is properly installed
4. When u plug it in, it's supposed to put out a message asking u whether you'd like to trust the thing, or if not, check the command center thing."
fbkzzd,"Try this: With the eGPU connected, go into Device Manager and Scan for hardware changes."
fbkzzd,"I think someone reported his eGPU not functioning properly on the 9300 as well, yesterday."
fbkzzd,Just wondering what is the SSD model on your laptop if you have the 1tb version?
fbkzzd,"Just wondering if there is any update on the issue? Has dell come down to look at the issue?

My XPS 9300 is coming next week but so far I've been hearing several reports of TB3 not working properly on this model -- eGPU and 5k monitors.

Does the eGPU work fine when the laptop is charging on the other port?"
fbkzzd,"Hello,

fbkzzd,8gb of ram ?
fbg38e,"I'm about to pull the trigger on a 9300, or a 7390.  I'm leaning towards the 9300.  I'm aiming to use it for eGpu gaming, and coding.  I'm thinking the 16:10 screen on the 9300 would be best; however, I'm worried if I get the FHD, that I won't be able to fit enough on the screen even with scaling making everything smaller.  I do a lot of ""columns"" side-by-side of code/text.  Would your opinion be that the FHD would be adequate, or go with 4k?  I know you mentioned not being a professional user, but figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for an opinion."
fbg38e,"How about the battery life? I don’t care about 4k or 1080p, but I hate the plastic border on the full HD version. Too bad that they don’t offer full hd with touch and glossy screen in my country."
fbg38e,How was the battery life when you weren't gaming? I'm getting the 4k one as well and I'll be using it for browsing and just basic homework stuff
fbg38e,"The yellow tint might be from the EyeSafe display technology... 
Have you double checked if you have windows night mode turned on by any chance?"
fbg38e,Which SSD did they put in there?
fbg38e,"The two Thunderbolt ports is completely unacceptable considering the previous generation had two, as well as a third USB C Gen 2 port.    

Thunderbolt is natively built into Ice Lake so it’s actually very cheap to implement now.   

When plugged in, only having access to a single port is a complete joke.   

They should’ve at the bare minimum had 2 Thunderbolt and 2 USB C Gen 2 ports."
fbg38e,My 9370 had light yellow tint from middle to heavier on top. Does your screen get the same tint?
fbg38e,"Just received mine and noticed the yellowish screen too. 

I turned off 'Play HDR games and apps' under Display settings in Windows and the yellow cast went away!"
fbg38e,which games you played on it?
fb6dhx,"Seems to me if you can't see those issues on your own, they're not worth worrying about.

As far as the data, there's a number of M.2-USB adaptors to help with that. Be sure to get the appropriate kind for your SSD (i.e., NVMe or SATA, I don't think there's an adapter that does both)"
fabrgk,"X1 extreme and XPS 15 / Precision 55x0 are similar stories: 45W CPU with a considerable GPU packed in a case too thin to cool them properly at combined heavy load (gaming or CPU+GPU intensive deep learning or such), even i9 alone is overkill with these heatpipes and fins. 

XPS 15 should get a refresh in April, if you care for it."
fabrgk,P1 gen 2 will be expensive 🥴
fabrgk,"Worst decision you’ve made. I’ve switched fro Lenovo to dell and I wish I never had... 

1.	Customer support is garbage 
2.	driver support is also garbage along with the bloatware that dell includes with their drivers
3.	their machines don’t and can’t compare to the think-pad line of products"
fa5ma5,"Having the same problem here, laptop runs extremely hot and max charge capacity is now at 64 mWh, 2 hours battery life max, while battery health seems to be excellent, according to dell power manager and bios. Have tried downgrading bios back to 1.13 to see if that would help. Only thing it did was disable my fingerprint scanner lol. I also dont have a restore point :/"
fa5ma5,"Same exact problem here. I verified it with a restore point, but unfortunately after restoring and updating again to verify the problem, the restore point was deleted, so I'm screwed. My old roommate with a 9570 has the same issue too. What's your voltage hovering around, out of curiosity?"
fa5ma5,"Same here too. I am using a XPS 15 9560 and my laptop thermals has gone way over limit on graphic intensive tasks after the update. I tried restore but cant find restore point. It has been frigging deleted. Now I have to live with this until I get a new update. Undervolting doesnt help much now. 

Or can I uninstall this update?

Suggestions?

Thank you"
fa5ma5,"Hi,

Prajwal here from Dell.
It is unfortunate ti hear that you're having issues with the system after recent windows udates.

fa5ma5,"Try DDU uninstaller remove the intel and nvidia graphics in safe mode and let windows update do its thing afterwards.
Might be a transitioning problem from normal driver to DCH drivers."
fa5ma5,"I'm not sure an update can effect a battery, but it might  have to do with fan drivers it could have screwed them up. But it is more likely that that you did not update them"
f9x79d,"The biggest issue is heat.  Plan on under clocking and under throttling if you want plan on gaming.  These things run at close to 100C out of the box.

I don't experience much throttling anymore, I have it under clocked to 3.5ghz and undervolted 100ma.  My temps stay low and plays most games well."
f9gib3,Why RAID 0?
f9gib3,"> upgrade the wifi card on my Dell Inspiron 7590 to wifi 6. Anyone know of any cards that are compatible? 

Intel AX200 should work. But mind recent wifi ""advances"" are mostly marketing blahblah that mostly doesn't work in practice. You are likely to get higher speeds at close range, which aren't problematic anyway. If you are having issues with the Killer, firstly try removing old Killer drivers with Killer uninstaller, then install fresh wifi&BT drivers from Killer site (""driver-only"" version!), and mind disabling Windows Update auto driver updates while doing this.

f9gib3,Thanks!
f98uij,Is the drive set to use RAID in BIOS? That would block the ability to use SMART.
f98uij,"Is your boot drive in RAID? If it is what RAID is it 0, 1, 5, 10? Try a factory reset it should not have any problems with Windows being installed."
f98uij,Just use a normal boot drive. Microsoft has a media creation tool if you can access another pc.
f8l51w,"Pretty dated at this point.  If the hardware is in your budget, sure, but most people have moved on.   4K video through the dock is possible, but not fast enough for full FPS playback.  

It'll work, but you're buying about 5-6 years behind what's ""current""."
f8l51w,"Or, is there any better alterntative to e7440 which will have similar price and will be easy to carry. Thank you"
f8l51w,It will do it but the integrated video may cause issues with video editing. I used one for light programming and managing virtual environments.
f7dtce,"It'll be a lot more problematic when you try recording stuff. Playback is generally gonna be fine, but anything real-time or latency-sensitive might give you issues."

f6ci8n,"I have a XPS 15 7590 4k OLED, so hope this is the same. In the Intel Graphics Command Center there is a tab 'color'. Under that you can decrease the 'saturnation'. That will help a lot."
f6ci8n,I'm not sure if it's the same for OLED but for my 4K IPS screen I had the same problem. Uninstalling Dell PremierColor then switching to Dell CinemaColor and turning it off worked for me.
f6cnsm,Dell laptops are made to order in China. Unless Corona virus magically disappears there are gonna be major delays
f6cnsm,"For me I purchased a Dell Xps 13 beginning of this month.

Wondered why estimated delivery was March so I gave them a call.

1st guy told me don't worry he will contact and expedite my order.

A week later...no update. So i try again.

2nd guy tells me there are shortage in parts so there is no real estimated time.

What? How do they not have enough parts to ship a product they have listed for sale?

So now I'm starting to realize that a laptop I ordered will probably take longer than a month to come. If I bought from any other site, it would have been at my door by now.

Unbelievable."
f5k21b,"Dell sent me a replacement motherboard for mine (latitude 5490) due to a noise I was hearing which they determined to be something related to excessive power throttling.

When replacing the board I notice the same you did with the professor paste being caked and dry. I doubt that was doing anything.

I used MX-4 on with new new board and temps has been way lower than they where before.

I'd recommend anyone with high temp problems to replace the thermal paste with a better quality than the tooth paste  Dell uses."
f5k21b,"Thats nice, but you should still undervolt if you want further drops in temperature."
f5k21b,"I also have a dell G5 5590.

Did the same thing during the first week I got it. I don’t know why dell has yet to fix this issue, it makes them look really bad in the eyes of the consumer. Luckily it is a fairly easy fix but so many people are uncomfortable with opening a laptop"
f4ukh4,"From [ultrabookreview](https://www.ultrabookreview.com/34503-dell-xps-13-9300-2020/) :

>Finally, Dell updated the speakers. Previous XPS 13 got a pair of 1W  speakers, while this one gets more powerful 2W speakers. They’re still  bottom-firing, but the audio comes out through larger cuts, much like on  the XPS 13 2-in-1. In fact, I expect the audio quality to be quite  similar between the two, which should translate in volumes of up to 80  dB and pretty good quality for this class, even at the lower end where  the previous XPS 13s struggled."
f4ukh4,"I know it’s not what you’re looking for, but I was able to compare a 7390 to a 7390 2 in 1 yesterday, and hands down the 2 in 1 speakers were far better. Louder and fuller. Not Macbook Pro level by any means, but they surprised me a lot. So, if they’re able to incorporate the same speaker improvements from the 7390 2 in 1 into the 9300, then it’s very promising."
f4ukh4,How many people actually have the 9300?  I've seen one review on here so far.  Haven't seen any professional reviews.  The link from the other poster is just a preview.
f4sjl1,"I use Crucial for that info:

yes"
f4sjl1,Thank you. I will try crucial.
f45fp4,"I installed it the day after it came out. It says that you cannot downgrade before version 1.6.x, I tried to downgrade to version 1.11.x and it did not work, at least not by just clicking on the .exe file.

It also mentions the ""improved fan performance"", if you use ultra-performance the damn fans are on all the fucking time even if it dips below 40c, so I have to switch to the optimal setting and then it gets hot real quick. I am guessing those intel patches really caused the processor to take a hit because the cpu is producing more heat and I don't see any performance improvements.

As for the reduced DPC latency, first thing I did after installing the new BIOS was running latencymon, and nah, there doesn't seem to be any improvements whatsoever.

As a final note, I started hearing coil-whine, which I never did before.

So yeah.

&#x200B;

ps, I haven't tried the other method to downgrade the bios, and I will try ableton later to see if I still hear any clipping etc."
f45fp4,Any noticeable differences compared to 1.9.0? I'm satisfied atm with -0.150mV undervolt.
f45fp4,"So only Intel fixes. Not updating, thanks."
f45fp4,"hello men , i made this update to the bios but i notieced some problems with gaming   
after this update the laptop started to get some low fps in games i can not say why there is no overheating what so ever , but before the update wheu i look at cpu frequnsi in taskmanenger it was always at 3.9 to 4.1 GHZ  always not depend on the usage of cpu but now it is going low and high in games the same i am playing gta v for example and  the frequnsi goes from 3.5 to 900 MHZ  this is so werid even in low demadnding games like fifa 20 i noticed the same before the update i had 60 soulid fps but now i am dropping 58 and in games u notice some lag when this happen . and i have 2 laptop G5 and i have same thing on both of them and the problem is i can not get back the older bios to check if this is for sure the problem or now the bios does not allow me to go back for older version / by the way i cleaned my laptops fans and i did undervolt and even in aida full cpu and in heavn beanch mark at same time there is no overheating ."
f45fp4,I am also still waiting for some feedbacks. This is the first post i see about it.
f45fp4,"After all the problems I had last year, I just gave up. After thermal pasting I got the temperatures down to a point where it was reporting my CPU was getting to full potential at 79 C after undervolting but even though both GPU and CPU were reported as normal-like temperatures, my keyboard often overheated. I just didn't have the desire to game much anymore, at least not anything intensive.

Just a couple of hours ago I decided to try out 7 Days to Die for the first time in maybe 2 years and my laptop felt like it was melting. Then it blue screened of death'd. I restarted the laptop and looked online and to my amazement there was a new BIOS. I downloaded, installed and tried again. It didn't seem to overheat as intensely, but then I lowered a few more graphics settings. It was still hot all over including the front of the keyboard. And it crashed again, this time after I searched a birds nest. This crash was not a blue screen and the program just shut down. I suspect this might be due to RAM, not overheating.

For whatever reason, this laptop has had a tonne more RAM issues than my previous laptop which was also 8GB Windows 10. I have run countless scans of the RAM but it detects everything is okay. I do know 7 Days to Die is evolving towards 16GB systems. I'm not buying another 8GB of ram just for 7 Days to Die or waste it on a computer which might be dying from the overheating.

My keyboard is failing, the finger print sensor no longer works and it behaves oddly on sleep it seems to take forever to recognize that I am trying to start it up again). All of these problems started late last year when I attempted to game and it overheated. My last laptops keyboard died the same way when after 3 years of use it was overheating tremendously (I didn't know then that the problems might have been solved by reapplying thermal paste). I'm not throwing money down on this piece of crap.

(Right now my parenthesis and 7 to 0 keys are working, so maybe I melted it back to working?)"
f45g66,"I personally recommend just buying a new monitor, it saves you the hassle of having to dismantle your display and you can use your laptop display as a secondary monitor.

But.

I've been looking to upgrade my Dell G7 7588 slowly over time and these are some videos I've stumbled across for the panel upgrade:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcZY54PHalU&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcZY54PHalU&t=175s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXy2Q3vr9J4&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXy2Q3vr9J4&t=10s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvD\_Ei2hUT4&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvD_Ei2hUT4&t=2s)

Although panel upgrades seem like a good idea, a lot of the time it'll leave your laptop without any brightness adjustment so you might be stuck on max brightness. Just something to keep in mind.

Side note:

I also highly recommend repasting your cpu and gpu, I just did it to mine and although the performance increase isn't dramatic, I went from COD MW thermal throttles without throttlestop to it runs fine without throttle stop

max temp decrease from 99-100 to around 94, average temp decrease from 78-84 to around 66-70 during gaming, mhw, codmw, etc.  It also cools off faster if that's anything for you (like from a minute and a half to reach 70 from closing the game to a minute and a half and its back to 50."

f3ob66,"I had this exact issue with a Dell Latitude a month ago. I did a complete wipe and reinstall of Windows and still had the error.

f2t882,"As a loyalist to the XPS line for many years, I can agree with the sentiment of the other post. I've had XPS laptops back to the L501X, and the 7590 (on my third at the moment) will be my last.

Dell is apparently dedicating more resources to the Precision model that now shares the same chassis as the XPS 7590. The build quality and QC of the 7590 has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The first one almost caught fire, the second died within a week and the third I say a small prayer everytime I open it hoping it still works.

I still have an XPS L521X that is still functioning to this day, my 9550 died when the battery expanded overnight and the main board fried (lasted abt 3 yrs), my 9560 has an SMBIOS error which means it needs a new main board per Dell (died while one of my 7590s was being replaced by Dell) , and my 7590 (i7/32Gb/1Tb) is a roll of the dice, but the ProSupport Plus warranty runs until 2023 so the jury is out as far as how many I'll go through in that time. 

If you want to have a reliable machine for video editing, or for use in any kind of production, get the Precision model and 3 years Pro Support Plus or a different laptop brand altogether. You'll not regret it.

f2t882,"Laptops based on the Tongfang platforms like Eluktronics, Shenker, Walmart's EVO, Maingear, and more were really tempting for me, especially when Walmart was selling their 1660ti equipped (but non Thunderbolt version) around $850, but the allegedly IPS screen just lacked the magic of the 15.6"" Samsung OLED that Dell and others use (eg. Gigabyte Aero).  


For music production you don't need such OLED, and for video editing, I much prefer using the 40"" 4K TV I use for a monitor on my desktop where I can see what I'm doing, so ***the value of OLED isn't for editing, but for showing clients*** because you'll want to plug in an external monitor to do video editing and color grading. 4k OLED will make your videos look their best, but many laptops use this same screen. Consider touch screen screen too for having a pen and its value for photo and video editing. If you want lots of computing power cheap, perhaps HP Omen.

That said, I'm considering returning my XPS because the OLED screen has suddenly gone blank several times in the 9 days I've had it."
fes643,"That's the UEFI logo in the BIOS. On desktops, you can change it easily in general, using EZUpdate / MyLogo. Failing that, you need a tool from the BIOS vendor (e.g. AMI ChangeLogo if it's an AMI BIOS).

You can also check the BIOS options in case you can disable the logo. The Windows logo will show up during boot, in that case."
fes643,You don't like the incredible mate?
fes643,"Look in the bios usually in the boot section, and turn off Full Screen Boot Logo, after you when you boot you will see the Windows Logo."
fes643,"I used something called : HackBGRT.  


I changed to a custom logo."
fes643,"It's the logo from efi graphics buffer pool. And windows is using it during boot, you can disable it off your bios utility had that option. And if you want to change it you have reflash the EEPROM with customized firmware file using a flash utility like EZ flash utility which is Dangerous,I mean if something goes wrong you'll not be able to boot again and you have to change the EEPROM chip on the motherboard."
fes643,Haha....you can change to Apple logo lol
fes643,no whats the point
fes643,Fresh install of windows via usb should do the trick

fcwbeh,Should be in Aura settings. You can set power on and shutdown colors
fcwbeh,No specific times. You only get lights off or on while the computer is off or a lighting profile. Even while off there are some small lights that never come off completely I think.
fcwbeh,It’s in the bios settings. Look for power management and select S4+S5.
fcwbeh,"1. Go into BIOS

2. ~~Under ROG Effects -> Switch the lights off when the System is in Sleep/Hibernate or Powered off stage.~~ My bad, the RGB Effects can be accessed under Advanced->On Board Devices Configuration->RGB LED Lighting->""When system is in sleep, hibernate or soft off state"" -> Disabled

Alternatively, you can turn them off in Aura Sync Software as well, but if you uninstall it, the lights will turn on again."

fchv6h,"Just a note the need to update the bios is normally for older chip sets (like the x470) working with the new CPU's (3700x). 

On the CPU support list ( [https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/TUF-GAMING-X570-PLUS/HelpDesk\_CPU/](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/TUF-GAMING-X570-PLUS/HelpDesk_CPU/) ) it looks like it's supported by a BIOS 704 and above, which was released nearly a year a go. So I guess it's possible your board has an older version, but unlikely. Maybe if you got it used, or one that was on the shelf for a long time. Also, I would think that an older chip like a 2700x should at least post on an older BIOS but might not work optimally. Seems odd to me that it would not be support from the start."
fchv6h,"That’s my exact setup. I’m running it just fine with no issues at all. 

Seems like it might be another issue.

Edit: I’d do an RMA for the mobo and see if that fixes the issue, if not maybe try to RMA the power supply and see if it’s a power draw issue."
fchv6h,Glad you figured it out. I'm surprised you can force fit pcie power connector into mobo 8-pin. I almost did the same mistake but realized it won't fit due to different pin configurations.
fchv6h,i got the same and had no issue except bios not recognizong m.2 and hard drive at first once i fixed that it was smooth sailing
fbxpzv,"The chipset gets hot and needs a fan and there's nothing we can do about it. If your motherboard's chipset fan is loud then you have to replace either the fan or the motherboard, in other words -- I don't think anyone will tell you otherwise. My temperature is \~65 °C and the PCH fan turns at \~2900 RPM all the time, but it's pretty quiet."
fbxpzv,"My system is a TUF Gaming X570-Plus, 3700X, 1080, and 16Gb 3600Hz RAM. My PCH temp averages in the mid to high 50Cs. Most times my fan runs at low hundreds (3 - 5 hundred). I run my system 24/7, and do not have a NVMe drive. From my observations via watching posts concerning this MB, it seems that running an NVMe drive causes the chipset to run hotter, it may also be that your video card (PCI-E 4.0) may be the reason for your higher temps (using more of the chipset). Also I run my system in a positive pressure mode with 2 140MM fans blowing into the case from the front which offers good airflow towards both my vid card and the PCH. Hope this gives you some ideas. Good luck."
fbxpzv,"Fractal Design Vector RS/TUF Gaming X570 Plus/Ryzen 5 3600/RX 5700/32gb 3200 c15/XPG SX8200 NVMe

PCH Diode idles between 47-50c. When gaming, it actually drops in temp because the GFX fan speed goes up so it helps with cooling the chipset and drops its temp down to 43-46c. I think i have never had the chipset fan start spinning yet.

Do you have your gfx card on the first pcie slot? If so, and if it is not a blower-fan style, it will actually help dissipate the heat from the chipset if you keep an idle fan speed of the gfx card at around 600-1000 rpm. At that speed almost all gfx fans are virtually silent so it will not bother you.

Also, front intake fans will certainly help move the air over the chipset but that greatly depends on your case and what fans you have  at the front.

If you want i can make some pics of how my case is setup atm, since we almost have identical components"
fbt4fb,"Link Near and Link Remote can be safely disabled.

Also, what is the laptop/MB model?"
fba6dp,Unfinished download. Be careful as there is NO warranty on ASUS hardware that has had a new BIOS flashed.
fba6dp,"So it's not fully downloaded? Being a partial download (.part)


The easiest way to find your BIOS version is to open up the System Information app by typing msinfo into the Windows search bar."
fatqzz,Your processor only has 16 lanes available. The motherboard only supports up to 16 lanes. Your HBA will consume lanes as will your NVME drive. You don’t have 16 lanes available to use for that card
fatqzz,"Like others have stated. Your NVME drive technically steals PCIE lanes, generally the way it’s split up is 8x for the PCIe slot and 8x for the NVME drive. I’m not entirely sure of the quadro as work stations aren’t my thing, but the r/gamersnexus YouTube channel has done some significant testing in graphics cards running at 8x vs 16x speed and there isn’t anything that supports that running at 8x speed to be a bottle neck in terms of gaming. Again, I’m personally running a 2080ti in gen 3 8x without any issues. workstation applications could be different than gaming, but I’m not sure. At 8x PCIe 3, it’s still has a bandwidth of nearly 8 gb a second, PCIe gen 4 in 8x speed comes very close to PCIe gen 3 x16 speeds at about 15.5 gb a second. 

[see the X8 vs X16 here :)](https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2488-pci-e-3-x8-vs-x16-performance-impact-on-gpus)"
fatqzz,"What are you plugging into the HBA? That's what steals the graphics PCIe lanes. The nvme drive won't if it's plugged into the motherboard, it uses the chipset lanes (and only uses 4)."
fawypb,"Yes I had the same issue!! You need to remove the drive, update the bios to the latest version and then it will work fine!"
fawypb,"hey i have the same issue with a asus rog x570-e motherborad and the same drive, it just wont post with the sn550 plugged in"
fawypb,updating to the last version of bios solved the problem for me.
fawypb,Now I've just got my replacement drive from WD and the problem still persist. I wonder if this is a BIOS issue.
f9f930,"Yep, on my 3rd Asus RMA.

Bios updates ruined my board and have told them several times what bios’ did work for me. Every time “okay I will put a note on your RMA case to have that bios installed”.

Such a shame, because I do think they make good quality products. They just lack the whole support side of business.

I switched to a MSI b450 tomahawk max, more than satisfied."
f9f930,[deleted]
f9f930,What board was it?
f9f930,Is this a hardware upgrade or a complete new build?
f8recf,"Also, I should say that this doesn't seem to be ""IPS glow"". The bleed decreases with brightness. It also responds to slight pressure on bezel and the color is uniform. I'm thinking of exchanging this laptop but wondering if this is standard quality for these."
f8recf,"yes, sadly."
f8recf,"I had a GL704GW that was looking the same, got the laptop replaced the next day. The next device was better but the panel still had light bleeding. To mee that seems like a overall problem with the AUO Panel thats used."
f8recf,Turn down the brightness.
f8recf,Thanks for your feedback everyone. I'm going to replace this and see if my lottery is better. I was afraid this was going to be a widespread issue. I see people reporting the bleed on several devices too. It would be nice to find an OLED at only slightly higher price point but it seems you really have to pay premium for those.
f7o274,Plug in the antenna that came with the board. Its for wifi and bluetooth. Was having same problem
f7o274,"Is it showing up in device manager? If so right click > update driver > browse > select that file 

If not, you may have a bigger issue on your hands. Literally just returned the same mobo for the wifi dying on it overnight. Did troubleshooting for hours before realizing it was a lost hope."
f7o274,"If you are not seeing wifi and/or bluetooth in your device manager, make sure it is enabled in your BIOS  and then try shutting down and unplugging the computer for a while.  This fixed things for me and at least one other Redditor.  


Copy/pasting from one of my previous comments:

>Hey, I had a similar issue a day after I built my PC with that same motherboard. I actually wrote into support, was told to check the most obvious things, etc. Finally they said I needed to RMA.

>It was the weekend so I disconnected everything, unplugged it and used my old computer.  
>  
>A day or two later, before disassembling and extracting the mother board, I decided to try one last time. But this time everything worked as soon as I powered the machine. Bluetooth was detected by Windows.  
>  
>The only thing I ""changed"" was completely shutting down and unplugging the computer, and then leaving it off for a day. Maybe it needed a full discharge or something. But it's been working fine ever since, and that was about 3 or 4 months ago.  
>  
>TLDR: Try completely unplugging the machine, leave it off for a while and try again."
f7o274,"So to clarify, I see the the bluetooth icon, and I can see it tryiing to pair with devices (When I try to add a device), but it can't find any bluetooth devices.  I tried connecting those same devices to other things, and I know all the devices work, but some odd reason, my computer cannot find them anymore.

They worked previously, but they do not work now."
f7o274,"SMALL UPDATE.  So I figured out it's connecting to bluetooth, but I just have to be EXTREMELY CLOSE, like the device needs to be rihgt next o the motherboard.  I've never seen this situation.  Could my case be blocking my bluetooth signal from the motherboard?

I opened the door on my case and the signal works better?"
f7o274,"This is why you want to move wireless connection (or soundcards) out of the reach of interference, sure even cable has it's problems, but it's vastly better than near the high frequency source, which there are many on the mother board. I recommend to even buy a cheap BT  dongle and plug them onto your USB hub/monitor. For wi-fi just buy a desired wi-fi type router and then connect it with ethernet cable. Internet is as expensive as it is for you to loosing speed."
f6guc7,"This is very sad story.  I send my card to asus yesterday, but i don't expect much if they didn't replace your card with evo."

f63d84,It sounds like power to me. 24 and 8pin plugged in?
f5dl7g,My gx502 has 32 in it. I'd assume the ga502 can go up to 32 as well
f5dl7g,If you have the model that shipped with 16gb you will not be able to go above 24gb. 8gb is soldered on to the motherboard.
f4xc40,Make sure you have dual channel for ram. My gu502 only shipped with 16gb on the motherboard and performance was lackluster until I added another 16gb.
f4xc40,Can you rightclick on an Program and select start with gpu?
f3lc91,Hmm
f3lc91,300MB cleaned up. That system is going to fly now.

eud4ow,"Happened to me you can check all my recent posts and comments.

Two main points:

- asus makes good products

- asus are idiots for locking the bios’ at 1404 and above (I’m sure they had to but still,,, it’s fricken bios)

What I did:

I went to micro center bought a $100 MSI b450 tomahawk Max, switched them out, and have been running smooth ever since. (MSI allows downgrades and even has bios flashback button on the back.

Sent Asus board back for RMA, they replaced the board, I was super happy.

Spent my off day switch back in the asus board, and BAM back to BSODS and a windows that didn’t work.

Switched back to MSI

Called amazon despite being past 30 day return, told them I want to contact my bank and get the charges removed because I didn’t pay $200 for something to not work when I know exactly how I can fix it.

Amazon got a “level 1” support person from asus, seemed to know more about what I was saying. Told me he will put a note on my new RMA saying “Needs Bios v1005”.

Sounds like my hairdresser saying “I’ll put that in your notes for next time”.

But who knows maybe they will put bios 1005 on there for me, I’m sending several sheets of paper in the RMA box reading “needs bios v1005 please”

Deciding if I should big text or a bunch of repeated small text, I’m leaning towards big.

Edit: wishing you luck"
eud4ow,"I can't help with your problem but have RMAd several boards over the past 2 years to Asus.  A STRIX Z70-E and a Maximus XI Hero (WiFi)  twice.  I find them very responsive if you have a real problem and have done proper diagnosis prior to the RMA request.  They do have a program to send you a board at the beginning of the RMA.  You pay for it and if they receive your board and it is indeed defective than they credit what you paid for the replacement.  The reason I ended up with both the Z370 and the Z390 Maximus is I decided to buy the Maximus myself when I RMAd the Strix X370-E rather than participate in their program, so I ended up with two Intel boards.  At some point I will sell one of them along with my older 8700K chip.  But for now they are spare parts in case something breaks."

fg8br6,Easy to change but be warned the T450 has an LCD whitelist. only affects windows so if your going to put linux on it then your fine... if your going to continue running windows then you should 100% buy a panel with the right FRU. the only FRU for the T450 that is FHD and IPS is the 04X5916

fg8br6,"Keep in mind the T450s has an LCD whitelist, on Windows brightness control will only work with whitelisted displays. You can either buy a whitelisted display or modify a nonwhitelisted one."
fg8br6,"Hi, I just went through a week of searching for screens, I read this sub extensively, read the reviews of laptops shipping the screens I as looking for in [notebookcheck.com](https://notebookcheck.com) and apparently the consensus is that you have 3 good options with IPS screens: the [AU Optronics B140HAN01.3](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Yoga-14-Convertible-Review.133661.0.html) that seems to be the cheapest of the three, the [LG LP140WF3-SPD1](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T450s-Ultrabook-Review.142700.0.html) and the [Innolux N140HCE-EN1](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ZenBook-UX3410UA-Notebook-Review.192282.0.html) rev C2 (do not buy the rev C1 as it won't fit, the rev C4 and rev C5 apparently are the same panel and will fit just fine) have similar prices. In the links I put the notebookcheck review of models that come with those panels from the factory.

So, here is the subjective view from people that bought those screens here in this sub:

**B140HAN01.3:** extensively recommended, but a lot of people came to complain about things like: grainy screen because of the matte finish, low brightness, yellowish or blueish tone that gets better with calibration but isn't totally fixed and a higher power consumption. I discarded this screen because of this and had to decide between the next two (a tough one).

**LP140WF3-SPD1:** apparently it has the lowest power consumption and people was praising that they gained (!) battery life after changing to this screen, brighter than the AUO one and with a good black and white levels, however, the colour pallet seems to be a little limited, with the SRGB coverage lower than the other two screens.

**N140HCE-EN1:** it has 99% coverage of sRGB, 350 nits (the brighter of the three) but with a lower contrast compared to the LP140WF3, a lot of positive comments on this one, except for one guy that said it have some burn in issues after 15 minutes of usage.

In the end, I decided for the **LP140WF3** one because I found one a little cheaper than the N140HCE one and although it has worse colour accuracy, the black levels and power consumption where really attractive to me.

**PS:** I didn't considered the FRU number because I'll just use Linux with the computer, however, it seems that it is possible to change the screen EDID to match the one that Lenovo requires.

**PS2:** I looked for prices just in Aliexpress since Ebay and other sites have shipping fees way too high to my country, and, if you want, I can make public and send you the wishlist I made when looking for the screens with a lot of sellers that confirmed to me that they have genuine screens and not just ""compatible"" ones (doesn't include the B140HAN since I stopped looking for it)."

ffv5lu,Welcome!
ffv5lu,veldig bra!
ffv5lu,"Nice choice

Sent from my T480"
ffv5lu,Hackintosh it
ffv5lu,"How do you find the trackpad to use? I am both a MacBook Pro and T490 user, and want to get other opinions."
ffv5lu,Any RAM suggestions? Any special brands or should I just go for the cheapest 2400mhz I can find?
ffv5lu,Welcome to the dark side
ffv5lu,Welcome to the team!
ffv5lu,"Welcome. I similarly went from macOS after many years to a T480s running Manjaro i3 and I’ve never been happier. 

Mostly because I can run dozens of docker containers where my MacBook Pro struggled with 3. 

But after switching I fell in love with i3. 

What I’ve found really interesting is that with Apple I’d want to get a new laptop every year. With my ThinkPad I’ve had no such desire."
ffv5lu,Up next Linux!
ffv5lu,"A beauty, welcome to the gang"
ffv5lu,"I just got my first T440p thinkpad today after a decade with a MacBook, I'm loving this thing!!"
ffv5lu,"Why did make this step? I'm genuinely curious. After some much time with OSX it's quite a jump moving to something else. Almost all the people I know that are long time OSX users admit that despite the Apple's bad hardware decisions, they cannot leave the OS."
ffv5lu,about to do the same!
ffv5lu,"Did the exact same myself last year and I'm very happy!

If you need more space, you can also add a second SSD (if you wanted to)."

fg5zy9,Have you installed tlp?
fg5zy9,Is it the 6 core i7?
fg5zy9,"I own both the X1C6 (i7) and X1C7 (i5) and run linux distros on both of them. To get your usage down to 3W-5W average you need to do a few things.:

1. Undervolt ([https://github.com/erpalma/throttled#undervolt](https://github.com/erpalma/throttled#undervolt))
2. Turn off unused ports in BIOS (WWAN)
3. Use the 'battery life' setting"
ffrbg7,"YES! YES! One of us, one of us! Love the X230 and it will love you back!


Also: AlphaTauri? WTF is wrong with you? ;)"
ffrbg7,Nice Pebble watch you have there.
ffrbg7,Is it a backlit keyboard? Also do the x230's have to have the adapter cord to run an ips screen?
ffrbg7,Notion users standup!!
ffrbg7,"Very nice, can i ask about the custom folder Icons, where did you get them?  And also with the performance monitor as well?"
ffrbg7,"Alpha tauri though, questionable"
ffrbg7,A little bit dated already ;)
fg31rc,"Wait for it to arrive first and see if your unit actually has the issue while you use it normally. If it does, then consider returning it."
fg31rc,"Please don't cancel it until you have it. I also have this laptop but don't think I am experiencing the keyboard problem. I am a programmer myself and a heavy typist who prefers to type on a mechanical keyboard -- based on my experience I think it typed okay. Since you already waited for a month, why not wait until it arrives and then see for yourself?"
fg31rc,My X1E2 does not have the problem. My P1G2 does. Wait for it to arrive and return if it exhibits the symptoms.
fg31rc,"My x1e2 just shipped and should hopefully get here some time next week. If you like I can update you on whether or not I am having that problem. 

Also, it does look like Lenovo is addressing the issue, with poor communication unfortunately. Users that have this problem have said it has gotten better with bios 1.29, not completely fixed though. 

What configuration did you get? I ordered mine on the 1st of March and it just shipped today. Only upgrades I made was the 4k ips and the i7-9750h."
ffe0cy,"Seems very clear, why it should replacing the keyboard?"
ffe0cy,"Screen upgrade is recommended, if its not already the IPS display.  I got mine last Thursday and I can't believe the difference its made!"
ffe0cy,Nice! Looks in great condition. My x250 is quite a bit more beat up
ffe0cy,Looks like it's in awesome shape
ffe0cy,How much?
ffe0cy,You could get a keyboard bezel out of an X250 if you don't like this clickpad and replace the keyboard at the same time
ffmux6,Beautiful keyboard you have there
ffmux6,Thanks man!!! Also; game runs... ish lol.
ffmux6,Ahhh your Spanish make me laugh xD
ffmux6,"Nice keyboard, Akko?

Also, what the hell do you mean by chingasos haz feliz a la gente hahaha"
ffnyi6,Not an expert. The difference is not much to me. The BIOS version matters.
ffnyi6,Have you got it plugged in while you are testing?
ffnyi6,Maybe BIOS. Maybe you lost the silicon lottery. I get about 172 single core with my 8750H (unchanged with undervolting). Multicore went from 1011-1063 to 1143-1191 after undervolting. Don’t remember offhand what OpenGL did before undervolting but the after was 125 FPS. This is with Kryonaut and a -0.140 V undervolt.
ffnyi6,"Do try to update the BIOS to the current version, helped me noticeably with battery life, fan behaviour and performance."
ffnyi6,Is your machine truly idle?
ffdzw9,I can believe it as someone who switched from a MacBook to a Thinkpad. Battery life just isn't the same.
ffdzw9,"For commenters: it's the worst **estimates**, or how accurate their marketed battery life is.

/u/DougyFresh10 /u/gruen-gewinnt /u/a-bengineering"
ffdzw9,">	As for Lenovo, out of 18 laptops we reviewed, only six (33%) fell within our permitted 2.5-hour window as a match with our real-world test results while the other 12 were flagged. The ThinkPad P72 took the throne as having the wildest battery life claim. It was advertised as having 18 hours of battery life, but conked out after just 4 hours and 19 minutes!"
ffdzw9,My trusty old 2015 Macbook Pro still gets 6-7 hours at max brightness (screen is a bit dim otherwise). So the degradation isn't too bad in my case.
ffdzw9,"Lenovo said 8 hours, I get 4 :("
ffdzw9,that's because macs do only light tasks while lenovos are used for real work.
ffkslc,It’s pretty difficult and time consuming. Replacement gen 3 carbons are around $300. I7/8gb 256gb SSD. I may have an extra hinge if your interested in attempting a repair.
ffkslc,"Looks like you need an lcd back and bezel. You MAY also need hinges, but they are usually metal and yours are probably fine, unless they were floppy before this mishap.  I've fixed quite a few laptops with this problem, and what usually happens is the captive nuts in the plastic parts break out of their sockets. The only fix is replacing the parts. Superglue, even if you took it all apart to glue it back together, won't last for long. You should be able to find the parts on eBay."
ffeshs,"You could consider the T480. You can upgrade the SSD/2.5"" hard drive and the RAM. The external battery is also removable, hot swappable and upgradable."
fevu6p,"This looks interesting, I'll keep watching. I want to see how it turns out"
fevu6p,Right on! My T440p is drooling in anticipation LOL
fevu6p,don't forget the 20K7 please :)
fevu6p,"Honest question as I think I know what ivyrain unlocks

What benefit would this have for the T480? And would the T480s be compatible? 

Thanks"
fevu6p,I've got a T440. Not sure where my soic clip is though.
fevu6p,Man where was this 2 weeks ago when I fried my t440p with a cheap soc programmer that dumped 5 volts down one of the data lines. Oh well at least I got an upgrade to an Nvidia board
fevu6p,Is there aby chance to make it work for broadwell based ThinkPad Yoga 12?
fevu6p,"Hey, I have a T440s with a forgotten bios password, and an X1 Extreme 2 with no password, let me know if I can help at all."
fetckm,"I just bought my new ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2 for over a day. It has the following specs:

* CPU: Intel Core i7-9750H
* RAM: 16GB DDR4 2666MHz SODIMM (in 1 slot)
* SSD: 2TB Samsung OEM vesion of 970 Evo Plus
* OS: Win 10 Pro
* Display: UHD 4K OLED Multi-touch

I moved 1TB 970 Evo Plus and 16 GB RAM from my ThinkPad T480s to the spare slots in my new X1. However, my old RAM is only DDR4 2400MHz, so the RAM is in dual channel but at lower speed (2400MHz).

I installed multiple Linux distros: PopOS 19.10, Kubuntu 19.10, Manjaro 19.02 Gnome and KDE. Among them, PopOS 19.10 runs best on the system.

I do have a few problem with the new X1EG2:

* OLED brightness cannot be adjusted in Linux. So it's 100% all the time.
* The keyboard feels better than T480s, but it sometimes miss a key (randomly) if I type fast. It has happened 6 or 7 times during just over 1 day usage.
* Battery doesn't seem to last (at least before I undervolt the CPU). I ran 1 hour 45 minutes (Nvidia, balanced mode) with battery dropped from 93% to 26%. 

I used Intel XTU to undervolt the CPU. After a few tries, I stopped with CPU at -150mv and GPU at -110mv, without going further. It passed 1 hour stress test. The GeekBench 4 result is quite good. 

After undervolt, when I do coding and browsing in PopOS (high performance mode with power plugged), the temperature is between 40 to 50°C with fan between 2000 to 3000 rpm. I can't hear the fan noise. So far so good. I'll do a battery test for my usage later.

Overall I'm quite happy with my new X1EG2. The screen is just fantastic. The system is extremely fast for my workload. PopOS looks gorgeous and runs smooth. Next thing is to get IR camera and fingerprint reader to work."
fetckm,"There has been a recent bios update 1.29 with a couple of somewhat significant changes: 

- They claim to have fixed the missing keystrokes,  but I don't see any difference on my machine. The missing keys are very rare on my machine from the beginning though.  

- At low load on AC two fans are now active rather than just one.  This slightly improves the surface temperatures during charging and thunderbolt usage,  but the machine is slightly noisier. 

I suggest you install this and see if it helps with the keyboard.  Proceed carefully though,  this update takes longer and more reboots than usual.  

Also,  I believe on Arch wiki there is a solution for the OLED brightness control."
fetckm,"send it back, get one with a working keyboard and a regular screen"
fetckm,I have the P1 equivalent. Do you use the trackpoint on Pop OS? I'm having trouble for finding a fix for the lag and stutter on it. Can't wait for a fix for the OLED max brightness problem.
fetckm,Thinkpads are the most Linux friendly ever
fetckm,"Battery problem :

More  than 400 patchs (only for intel platform and intel igpu) are still  pending to merge in latest linux kernels...- You wil encounter lags and battery drop : no  RC6 (reduce power of igpu when on battery) enabled ... I keep  4.19.81 kernel to avoid RC6 problems on my T480S. Above 4.19.85, you will  encounter problems ...

\- Using PRIME for dGPU is the best at this time.

\- Proper configuration of TLP will help having good battery time. Fix CPU frequencies, iGPU frequencies, disabling boost for cpu and igpu on battery,, limit max perf ...

\- Complete deactivation of nvidia dGPU when on battery is the way to go to last longer. Could be done with acpi\_call if dGPU is supported otherwise need to be done manually

\- Use throttled to manage undervolt. Furthermore there is a tool to monitor power consumption : [https://github.com/erpalma/throttled](https://github.com/erpalma/throttled) => Could be package in your distribution"
fetckm,"Try SOLUS before settling for a linux OS:

https://getsol.us/"
ff3ma0,"Is secure boot on on any of them? 

The only thing I can think of is that the T420 has a fairly basic/early UEFI implementaton, which doesn't support secure boot (and advanced things like reporting to the OS how much time was spent in firmware)"
ff3ma0,"I edited the OP on /r/linux4noobs and replied in more detail to somebody on that post.

TL;DR I converted the GPT-formatted USB to an MBR-formatted USB and now I can boot it on all computers including the T420."
feq4wd,Now you have stereo ... 🙄😂🤣😂
feq4wd,Neat
feq4wd,Hey! Even I have the x260(I got it for $150).. I love it.
feq4wd,neat-o
feq4wd,Where did you get it
ff1n1x,You can also very easily put in the T450 trackpad! I have a T450 and it’s significantly better and dirt cheap to do
ff1n1x,Going from 1080p to 3k isn't hard to upgrade. You just have to swap the 30 pin cable to 40 pin which does require some  disassembly but is definitely not hard.

fegt9o,"4:3... nice! Looks like it's in great condition too. Damn where did you get this? (I searched ebay high and low but didn't see this one) You don't see that version everyday. 

Check if it has the Nvidia GPU or the Intel GPU. What's the number on the bottom of the case? It should say Type-(some four digit number)"
fegt9o,Is the T61 the one that has the rotating screen?
ferg04,If you known the serial number you can find out.
ferg04,"Just fold the lid half-way. If the screen is still clear, its an IPS. If its foggy, its a TN display.
[TN vs IPS](https://live.staticflickr.com/8480/8283126522_7d94a390bf_b.jpg)"
ferg04,"You could ask seller to run a program like HWINFO under Windows 7/8/10, which will tell you exactly which screen is in that machine.   
Or get him to take pictures from that very machine with screen up straight, and at various angles L/R and up/down.  
Unfortunately there are very few sellers who even know how to do that, let alone DO that...    
Looking up the S/N on Lenovo only tells you what screen the machine had when it came from the factory.  
And if someone swapped the screen in the meantime you're stuck."
ferg04,Most adds have IPS mentioned if the screen was swapped. If it's not mentioned and you want to know you'll gonna have to send lots of info requests to sellers I'm afraid
ferg04,"It's a super easy swap, so budget the $60 or so bucks and buy an ips screen.

I've a got a few extra TN displays if you want them..."
fegfsu,"I literally just bought one on offerup on an impulse and have the exact same question.

fe4elt,"Battery: 9 cell 57++

Dock: 40A1 Ultradock - it has poor cooling performance, so sometimes laptop will do better on its own

Touchpad: Many people change to T450 Synaptics touchpad. I think clunkpad is fine, it's really just about preferences. Do not buy ALPS T450 touchpad as it usually has compatibility issues

Keyboard: Backlit

Charging port: There is a USB-C mod, though laptop needs beefy power supply - research needed on how it turns out, I'd expect some power deficit

RAM: 2 slots up to 8GB each, up to 2133 MHz

Processor: So many to choose from, It could be whole another thread. 4702MQ or 4712MQ should be just right, though you can place even 4900MQ if you can cool it (Thermal Grizzly and beefy fan are almost neccessary in this case)

Fan: if you have iGPU version, you can get dGPU fan with additional heatsink. Best ones are 00HM903(Toshiba) and 04X3918(Delta)"

fe4elt,"Having used both trackpads, the trackpoint buttons on the Alps trackpad are mushy which is just worse than the more clicky Synaptics trackpad. Both have less travel compared to the X230 trackpoint buttons but the Synaptics comes much closer to replicating how it was on the X230."

febmsz,"It may be a newer keyboard. On another note, I plan on taking my T43 to Prague from the UK- how's THAT for keyboard travel?"

Another night, another idea. Yesterday's ""Brainless ThinkPad"" https://old.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/fd0xee/ which works by miracast wireless display sharing, and is totally wireless/untethered with the help of an Anker USB powerbank, worked well with my T480s, my S10, and my desktop... but the experience was mirroring screens or extending desktops, which can be useful for a portable second monitor or portable 'notebook' type experience

but it it just so much more polished with Samsung DeX. By plugging in a simple and cheap (mine cost 8 Sterling pound) Lenovo USB-C to HDMI adapter, and HDMI-to-eDP LCD driver board, I was able to use the DeX experience on the Brainless ThinkPad as a much more laptop-like experience. This thing is going to kill chromebooks and low end laptops. Best thing is that it can last you years and years, and every time you upgrade your phone you're upgrading the ""Brain"" of your Brainless ThinkPad

**How it works:** 
The S10 acts as a touchpad, the ThinkPad Tablet 2 bluetooth keyboard is a keyboard with optical trackpoint (suboptimal but I'll take it), and the wireless untethered screen is... just that :)

For those wondering, yes such a product is *almost* available (it's a Kickstarter with a possibly shipping date of July 2020) from another vendor NexDock for $250 (and technically some later versions of HP's Lapdock X3 works in such a way but cost $600US new a few years ago)... but you can build this at home today and have an arguably better experience and more versatile device (thanks to wireless screen sharing via miracast adapter). And before that in the early 2010s, the Asus Transformer, Asus PadFone, and Motorola Atrix all did similar things (albeit in a much worse and practically unusable way). 

**Ingredients:** 

* Brainless ThinkPad (as previously described)
* Wireless untethered ThinkPad display (as previously described)
* Recent model Samsung phone (I think anything newer than and including S8, Note 8, S9, Note 9, S10, Note 10, S20 range) - although you may get a similar experience from any newer Android phone with desktop mode
* USB-C to HDMI adapter

Next steps (not already discussed in yesterday's post)

* 3D printed enclosure to tuck and tidy everything
* Switchable HDMI (have a 3-input HDMI switch I'll use without the casing) so you can use either HDMI-in, DeX mode, or Wireless Display mode without unplugging anything
* Anker Slim powerbank (I have 3 different ones on the way) to reduce battery weight 50%
* POSSIBLE ThinkPad X61 enclosure - as I have spare parts laying around from an X61 project, the ThinkPad Tablet 2 bluetooth keyboard is almost a perfect fit, and the 3:2 2160x1440p 12"" screen I ordered for another X61 ""Max Res"" project (update coming in late March/early April) also fits in the X61 screen/lid so it can be 'retro style' ;)"
fdmpdj,"Hi mate, would it be possible to explain once again how all parts and all connections in this configuration?

What is plugged into the phone? A USB-C to HDMI? Why do you say ""wireless"" display then? How is the the keyboard connected to the phone?"
fdmpdj,"He he imagining my ideal ""brainless Thinkpad"":

* X201/X220 style keyboard (required for me)
* 4\*3 hi-res screen
* T460+ style trackpad
* overpowered cheap phone like some Plus One with 8Gb RAM running Linux/Cubes OS
* wireless everything - no physical connection to phone to reduce wear and tear

All features apart from keyboard optional :) More of a pipe dream I guess.. Guess while one can buy X201 or X220 keyboard finding a controller to run it will be an unsovable problem.."

The only time it gets hot for me is when I have it charging on top of all this. But other than that yeah, mine does not overheat or come anywhere to heating up."
fblozi,"I also just got an x1c recently. Maybe you can try to download an HWiNFO64 to see the temperature? Many programs can show CPU and SSD temperatures. For mine, the CPU is around 35-65 C (depending on the room temperature) when idle. SSD is about 40-60 C. 
Overall, the temperature is OK, and the noise of the fan is minimal."
fblozi,"It could be that 6 core. Typically, the i5 runs cooler than i7. A 6 core i7 will likely be hotter than a 4 core i7. It might also be doing updates in the background since your comp is so new.

fb3u09,"Ah, the scrollpoint mouse. The nub behaves like a trackpoint in scrolling mode, only two directions of force are sensed, up and down but, not left and right. The centre button behaves like a normal middle click."
fb3u09,"Fun fact, in Windows with the built in drivers it's almost unusable because it emulates a scroll wheel, it's far too sensitive. If you can get the IBM/Lenovo drivers to work then you get better scrolling behaviour but it overrides horizontal scrolling (because it wasn't a thing when the drivers were written) and does things like moves the text cursor left and right, which to me was weird.

However, in Linux it works out of the box and the scrolling in all directions works flawlessly, no scroll wheel emulation, it acts like the scroll gesture on a trackpad, you can scroll a single pixel of you want. Best mouse for productivity in Linux imo."
fb3u09,"My parents had one that came with an early-2000s NetVista they bought new. When I was younger I hated the blue joystick thing so much and just wanted a mouse with a normal scroll wheel. I should ask and see if they still have it somewhere.

The alternative was my dad's Logitech [ball mouse](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IKgHCBQJS._AC_SX466_.jpg). Between those and exclusively using the TrackPoint on various laptops, my family had some weird aversion to normal pointing devices."

fb2i7r,"Hi,

I want to repaste my T480s with Conductonaut (liquid metal) and I just removed the heatsink. What I didn't expect is factory thermal paste on the smaller die (the chipset). In videos that show repasting of [Carbon X1 gen6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXR5-HwIre8) or [T470s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTvnaYbcVJI) the smaller die is never pasted. 

Some more images of the (clean-ish) situation: https://imgur.com/a/1kb3oSp

Can anyone confirm that I should not repaste the smaller of the 2 die's?

TIA

Edit: added some images"
fb2i7r,"Not an expert but it seems there's been good contact between the heatsink and both chips from factory? Why not do the same then?

If you're worried, I guess you can spread a bit less/thinner coat of thermal paste on the 2nd chip, shouldn't negatively impact contact between heatsink and the the main one?"
fb2i7r,"I would recommend just using a high quality non conductive thermal paste. The risk involved with using liquid metal out weights the pros. Thermal paste really isn't the issue with the cooling system, the small heatsink and fan is the main cause. 

I couldn't tell you the exact W/m K of the heatsink but my guess is it's a whole lot closer to non conductive thermal paste than it is to liquid metal."
fb2i7r,I have a T590 with an i7-8665 and I hit 95 instantly. Before I repasted the CPU it would thermal throttle down to 2.6-2.7GHz but after it runs around 3.2GHz.  Like I said the cooling system just isn’t enough to cool a i7

fason4,The t410 can be a good budget laptop if you can actually get one for cheap enough for sure. Itll still be able to most of todays basic windows10 tasks as long as you treat it with an SSD so factor that into your purchase decision. Every generation you can get after this is a pretty significant step up in actual usability in today's world so if you can get a t420 or a t430 for a small premium its most certainly worth considering.
fason4,"A T420 would be a much better option, and likely wouldn't cost much more either. There was quite a big bump in performance from 1st gen Arrandale to 2nd gen Sandy Bridge Core i chips. Both in CPU and IGP performance, as well as memory support.

That said, It ought to do what you need"
fason4,"Good enough.. If its stock, might want to lower expectation on screens as well 😀

If u dont mind the size try look for the x model, sometimes it comes cheaper for a good spec"
fason4,"If you can get it cheap enough and with decent specs, it will suit your needs. But also keep in mind that it has less upgrade potential. For example: the T410 only takes 8GB of 1066MHz DDR3, which costs as much as 16GB of 1333MHz DDR3 for the T420. On top of that, as others have mentioned before, newer processors will have a bigger performance bump too."

fah99y,"I first thought that it is a connection problem but it looks more like rare memory problem to me but - as you have said - the bars only appear on the LCD.

Yes, remove all things not required to reproduce the effect else they might get weird excuses for not testing.

I have had problems like this before but could work with the screen until the end of warranty. I got it then fixed. It came again after some years but then the machine was way too old to be useful."
fah99y,"I added two more pictures to the Imgur link, showing more clearly what the issue is.

It might be a connector problem (or a defective cable), because the problem can often be fixed (temporarily) by playing with the hinge a little bit (almost closing it without the screen turning off and opening it back up again)."
fam2hj,"It could be the ribbon cable but it might the screen/display/lcd also.

Your issue seems to be with the backlight(IMHO) so that can have a wealth of root causes and just to name a few : ribbon cable as mentioned by u/Perry2102, Display module backlight, Display module backlight electronics(small pcb under the display module that comes on the display itself and it is used to plug your ribbon cable coming from the laptop's pcb, OS drivers or ThinkEngine IC issues as the backlight is controlled from Thinkengine on the majority of Thinkpads( I am not sure about yours).

I had a similar issue on my Thinkpad L380 just under 10 days after I got it. I have tried all the driver, chipset and graphics updates before reinstalling windows and it did not help. I have tried live boot linux from usb stick, still not sorted. For me the fix was to call Lenovo and get an engineer sent out to my office( I have a call-out type warranty). What the engineer did was simple, he replaced my screen/display/lcd and I never had a problem since then. I found it good practice to test if it does the same in BIOS ( and it did) and tell this to Leonovo when i called the service center. The reason for mentioning this is that they could no longer say I need to update drivers as in BIOS your are not laoding OS drivers so that problem is out of the discussion.

I honestly suggest you to take advantage of the warranty if you still have it."
fam2hj,"It a bit difficult to make out but it almost looks like the tint of the screen is flickering, not so much the brightness.....

Try disabling all and any 'eye care' modes you can find, search for the options provided by windows (night light), those by intel drivers and dont forget that vantage has a setting for these too."
fam2hj,"I had a more constant flickering that started one day after my computer had froze. Screen flickering happened even after restarts and everything, I couldn't get it to stop. I decided to restore from a previous restore point... that worked in my case and I haven't experienced any more flickering. Might be worth a try in your case."
fam2hj,"Do drivers are updated. Idk just randomly doing this. And computer seems to lag as well.

ThinkPad X1EGen2"
fam2hj,The ribbon cable may be damaged which connects the display. Open it up and check it out if you can. The lag may be the screen lag not really system or hardware lag.

I had to put extra effort into searching for that model in the EU market. 

While some sites claim you can install a 16GB stick of RAM. Acer officially states that you can install up to an 8GB stick of ram.   

If that model has a 1TB HDD and a 16GB Optane SSD, you can replace the Optane M.2 SSD with a M.2 2280 NVMe SSD.  Then, you can use the NVMe as your Windows boot drive to make the computer a lot faster."

 Without more details I can only scan through the U.S. distribution models.  

I found the Model: SF314-56-58Q5  Part Number: NX.H4CAA.006 which ships with 4GB or 8GB without the ability to upgrade RAM.  There are variations of the SF314-56 that ship to the EU and Indonesia regions."

Acer KG241q has several models and differences depending on the regional distribution. Some models are only available in Indonesia while others are primarily sold from the United States.

dqd24k,"I've seen both. You should go with KG241Q as it's much more recent and futureproof. Also, the newer model contain VRB and can do 144hz over HDMI. There's no reason to buy GN246HL anymore. Where I live people buy the GN variant because it's cheaper but they don't realize they are missing out on motion blur reduction of VRB unless they actually see one."
dosgci,Different country has different release date. Which country are you from?
dosgci,"I may not know about the release date, but it is quite a banger of that laptop."
dn2mdp,"What are the specs?

Have you kept up the driver & software updates?"
dn2mdp,I see we have an Outer Worlds sub /r/theouterworlds. The players there will know more details about the game & performance.

dkd5nw,had mine about the same length of time and the only issue i had was replacing the 500GB HDD(agaming laptop with under a 2TB of storage is a damn joke) for 2TB was a bitch...the Bios really hates MBR'S(Master Boot Records)
dkd5nw,"When you registered the computer with Acer support, how much time was left in the warranty period?

That is your first official indication if the computer might have been returned by a previous owner or if it was tagged by Acer as a refurb or returned computer.

We've seen a lot of posts about the Nitro 5 [https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Acer%20Nitro%205](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Acer%20Nitro%205)"
dkd5nw,"I have the same problem (Issue #3) with my Acer Aspire 5 A515-43-R057 just now when I put in 32GB of compatible Crucial RAM and a 1TB Samsung 960 EVO SSD. My M.2 SSD that came with it stays in and keeps the operating system.

Upgrade was super easy. Took me 20min. Watched official video from Acer on YouTube.

I reconnect battery and boot. I first check the BIOS: Everything got detected correctly.

I boot Manjaro. Everything fine. I format the new SSD

I shutdown and put the bottom case on properly again and screw screws back in.

I reboot: No bootable device found. My body shivers hot and cold and my pulse goes to 200.

I reset the BIOS many times by pressing powee button for 2 minutes: Nothing.

I disconnect the SSD again. Nothing.

I boot a linux live stick. Hard drived do not show.

I find out Manjaro Live USB lets me detect other bootloaders. It finds my M.2 SSD's grub efi. How if the BIOS cannot find the drives? WTF????

My operating system boots flawlessly. All drives are detected and readable and writeable.

I can now only boot my OS from a USB Manjaro Stick. I can never install another OS again?

Does anyone have any news on this bug?"
dkd5nw,"I think with so much issue persists, go to an Acer repair centre and have it checked. Much better this way to get professional help."
djw95c,"erm, why is your Acer KG271 doing WHAT?   

You need to provide more information and a reasonable question.

I see the blue line down the middle of the screen but, I don't know what you want to know."
djw95c,"Try disabling G-sync.

Which video card do you have installed?"
dddlqp,"It will take a max of 16GB RAM and you can get a decent 100-256GB SSD for $50 or less.  If you upgraded to 8GB RAM and added the SSD, you would perk up the performance enough to be a reasonable little computer.  Swapping video cards will also help.

I didn't read the rest of the post, it was too much info all jammed together and I just didn't want to sort through it.

If you enter the SNID on the product support page, you can get all the correct drivers for the system. You can also check the original specs and download the User manual to determine what hardware can be installed.  
[https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/support](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/support)

You can also use that Windows 7 license to get the free upgrade to Windows 10. As of August 15, 2019 the free upgrade was still working."
d8osgg,"If you only need Predator Sense, it can be easely found googling for the laptop’s support page.

Reinstalling Windows from scratch is easy too"
d8osgg,"Formatting is not the same as partitioning, did you try the manufacturer's restore?  
(I'm wondering why you didn't do the manufacturer restore in the first place)

This isn't an ACER repair situation because all they will do is wipe the drive & install Windows from the recovery media.   
 If you truly repartitioned the drive and eliminated the recovery partition & data, did you try just ordering the eRecovery disk from Acer?  [https://us-store.acer.com/erecovery/rcd](https://us-store.acer.com/erecovery/rcd)

A bit after the fact but, this is why we keep telling people to make that system recovery media as soon as they boot the computer up for the first time."
d8osgg,Do you really need Predator Sense?
d6g84k,"This could be as simple as updating the GPU driver AND the GeForce software. Use the GeForce software to adjust your GPU settings, not the Intel or Windows display settings.

Battery life is one of those sneaky misdirects that all manufacturers exploit in their marketing efforts. Your machine was designed for performance, which also means it is going to consume a higher than average amount of electricity for that performance.  Adjusting your power settings to Balanced, turning down the screen brightness and adjusting CPU max speed will give you a longer battery life while reducing the performance."
d6g84k,"EDIT : Noticed ""but during normal use it will deplete in just over an hour as well."" are you playing on battery? you absolutely need to try while connected to power because on battery you'll have much lower performance.


Hello fellow Helios 300 user, I might just have your medicine.
Destiny 2 was smooth as butter for my PH315-51 and yours is a 17 inch model so this is completely unusual.

I recommend you reapply thermal paste as factory paste is usually bad quality and applied with least effort.Then follow the link below to reduce thermals further (shameless self post insert)


https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/d6mode/underclocking_igpu_on_intels/?

Besides this, use same tool to have following UnderVolt from the same FIVR page mentioned in the guide;

-125 mV on CPU core and CPU cache
-130 mV on intel GPU and iGPU Unslice.

Also look up MSI afterburner Undervolting, it helps quite a bit aswell."
d6g84k,"I think should be fine, get yourself the latest driver and make sure plugged in before playing games. You can try tweaking the settings or having some fps booster methods that could help as well."
d409wh,"I've seen quite  a few posts about problems with the Helios and MaxxAudio settings.  
Try resetting the default MaxxAudio options. You can also reset Windows sound control. Those are different apps and MaxxAudio has a lot more settings.

I'd also check for audio driver & MaxxAudio updates. You could have received a glitch from Windows updates that was then patched afterwards."

cxejeq,The a5 is a really good compromise between power and price imv
cxejeq,"For lower cost & decent performance, the Aspire 3 line is a good purchase.

If you are looking for a solid low to mid-range computer, the Aspire 5 line is a great performer. The A5 will have a higher resolution screen, generally 32GB Max RAM, USB-C/USB-3.1 gen1 and NVMe (Optane) port in addition to a 2.5"" SATA port."
cxejeq,Best bang for bucks. Based on experience.
cxejeq,Aspire 5 is pretty solid for the pricing. Very solid use for casual use.
cu71e1,"I am using a similar laptop and with a regular  cooling pad, and I am noticing a temp drop of about 5 °C when using it in an air conditioned room vs when not using a cooling pad, but at our regular tropical condition, my cooling pad doesn't help that much, I don't know if it will make a difference when using a high end cooling pad"

clnudo,"This is a really confusing post.   
First, you appear to want to know how to turn off your monitor.   
Then, you complain that when the monitor is turned off, your computer treats it as if it was disconnected, which it was because you turned  it off.

Since I have no idea what you really need help with, I'll simply respond to the title and remind you to look at the monitor Quick Start Guide which shows you all the buttons and their purpose.  Yep, I just said RTFM, with a smile.

cl5781,Here's the Ram sticks i bought from Amazon: https://i.imgur.com/VWu2HKz.jpg
cl5781,"It could be as simple as not having the RAM seated properly. Will it boot to the bios?

Oh, I looked at your picture. This is why I remind folks to look at the RAM that came with the  working computer to confirm what type you need to buy. I'm never surprised when the RAM that ships & works in the machine isn't what the manufacturer lists in the specs.

I noticed your picture is 1.5v DDR3-1333 PC3-10600. I had to look up the part number since you didn't show the detail sticker.  Crucial shows low voltage 1.35v DDR3L-1600 PC3-12800 for upgrade compatibility.

So, oops, you didn't verify the RAM before purchasing. It may not make you feel better but, I've worked on hundreds of computers and I've missed that ""L"" notation a couple times."
ch5wdi,"I just got the 2060 Triton 500 on Monday there, it runs off its onboard graphics and I’ve got the battery settings set so that even when it’s using the 2060 on battery power, it’s not using its full potential to make the battery last longer. I was under the impression the 2060 version had g sync too but I must be tripping because it favours on board graphics where it can to spare the battery. Sorry if this wasn’t the answer you wanted"
ch5wdi,"You would open the Nvidia Control Panel and simply uncheck the G Sync option to disable it.  If you are still confused, refer to the manufacturer's website.

hehe, RTFM is always going to be more accurate than anecdotes from people who don't own the same hardware.

I'm wondering how much battery life you would actually save considering that unit only has a  4-cell 5400 mAh battery to run all that hardware.  Maybe @Swarfle will try a few of the power profiles and share what the system will automatically adjust to improve battery life."
c7f3j4,"You should have a look at reviews comparing the models if you can, if not similar specced pcs with each of the gfx cards and their performance. In saying that, reviews I've seen of the '19 helios 300 with the 1660ti show it to be a beast"

c6wm04,"Okay, after tinkering for a while I've ""fixed"" it. It seems the screen won't turn on for the first time if you have video cables attached to it. I'v removed both HDMI and DP cables from the screen and it immediately turned on. I have to plug only the power cord first, then the video cables for some reason. Same thing applies every time I disconnect the screen from the power plug. After that it turn on and off normally.

Any idea as to why? Is it normal...!?"
c6wm04,"no, that is not normal."
c6wm04,"After even further test it seems fixed. Even if I disconnect the monitor from power, when I plug it back it comes back immediately no matter if the video cables are plugged in or not.

Very weird, no idea what happened. It could be that the power connector on the monitor side was a bit loose, it doesn't ""click"" in it just slides in, maybe I didn't insert it right or something.

Apart from the initial scare, i'm super pleased with the display!"
c6wm04,Better get these small issues fixed before the warranty period. Else you might not have the chance to do so in the future ;)
afbxrp,"If it is 2 years old, you should not need a windows key as it is already stored in UEFI. Once you start the setup it should automatically detect the key without you being prompted to put it in. Just make sure that you install the exact same version of windows that the laptop came with. If it came with pro install pro on it not home. what windows did it come with? 8.1 or 10?"
afbxrp,"Sorry. Just figured out what you meant. Google ""windows 10 media creation tool"" download it from Microsoft's website and run  it. Make sure you have a 8 gb memory stick with you. this will download the windows 10 setup on the stick and then you can run the setup from the stick. "
