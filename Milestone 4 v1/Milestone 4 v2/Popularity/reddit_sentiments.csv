Affiliate linkers are marked as such so that you are aware of the monetary incentive involved when making a purchase using affiliate links. However we are seeing an increasing number of cases where users posting on this subreddit are being targeted with unsolicited private messages containing links to laptops. Such messages are best ignored for several reasons 1. Lack of quality control We have no way of vetting suggestions sent via private messages. Moreover these suggestions are not subject to the same level of public scrutiny that applies to suggestions posted in the subreddit which are open for all to see and discuss. 2. Hidden monetary incentive Often such messages contain unmarked affiliate links and these links might not even point to systems that are best suited to your requirements. 3. Scams Scammers often target unsuspecting users via private messaging. We do not want you to get scammed. If you do happen to receive unsolicited messages suggesting laptops in private please report the offending user to the mod team by sending us a screenshot of the message.

After 3 months the finger print scanner malfunctioned. Then there was an issue with the Wifi card. Then with the motherboard. Three tech guys tried to fix it but failed. After some tough arguments with Lenovo's terrible support I got my money back. Now I'm back at my old MacBook but will soon need a new machine. What struck me was that two of the tech guys who fix Lenovo PCs and Macs here in Austria said that there is a huge difference in quality management. Lenovo has a rather good reputation but it's nothing compared to Macs which for instance according to them have serial numbers on most major parts. Lenovo doesn't. I'm generally against buying a notebook that I can't upgrade soldered RAM - wtf? but of course I'd rather have that than a machine that doesn't work at all.

Looking for reliability and peace of mind focus on a good display for content consumption not creation so color accuracy doesn't matter but vivid saturated colors are nice. Considering Surface Book 3 for which I would not buy the iPad but the lack of a significant design change since 2015 is sad and lackluster. I'm a big fan of the iPad as a tablet so the SB3's tablet mode would only be useful for note taking and is trash otherwise. Macbook Pro 16 looks good and in my mind seems to be very reliable. MacOS seems more reliable than windows which I've always used but stresses me out with the laggy updating blue screens. Best build quality speakers and quality control and best macbook pro since forever correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway it's way too expensive even though many issues are fixed so I'm wondering if it's worth the price. Currently using XPS 15 9560 whose trackpad has popped out due to swollen battery. Waiting for the new XPS 15 and 17's reviews to see if the Killer wifi thermals coil whine and other little annoying things have been improved. Better speakers and keyboard would be nice too. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme looks solid but I've heard bad things about the Carbon's quality control and Lenovo in general. Bezels are too thick but I could probably get used to this.

She likes her old Acer laptop not sure which model it is purchased 5-8 years ago and is having battery other issues . She got a chromebook but she's not a fan of it so I'm helping to find something else. The budget is approx 1 000 Canadian but a bit flexible suggestions can cost a bit more or less . She'll use it for general stuff - work emails netflix browsing the internet etc. but I'd also like to make sure she can use it for years to come. I'm looking for something with windows 10 a 15 screen would be good I think. Preferrably a decent IPS screen if her and my dad were to watch shows on it. I'd also like to make sure she doesn't run into any issues speed-wise so I'd like a decent SSD harddrive or whatever the new SSDs are called and possibly a bit of extra ram maybe 8gb total would be cool decent enough processor more battery life is probably preferred over more speed though . Also she likely wouldn't need too much storage overall but the more storage space the better I'm thinking if they download lots of shows movies etc. . Microphone and camera needed as well. She generally uses the touchpad instead of a mouse also no touch screen needed.

The goal is to host a modest local-only website that will provide information etc to visitors who connect to the hotspot with their phones. I was thinking a laptop may make sense for this since the information since the info will need to be 'loaded in' regularly. Hoping for something that fits these requirements well-suited for being on 24/7 knowing full well that any laptop is not really 100% designed for this .

2,gqgarl,SuggestALaptop,7,2020/05/26 10:26:57,Morning,Help me decide between two laptops Ryzen vs Intel  A very good friend of mine decided that she needs a new laptop. She doesn't want a PC because she wants to take it to University. Her budget is a bit tight but after some searches we found two very good options from HP This 250 G7 rocking an Intel i5-8265U with UHD 620 Graphics. And This weird model number laptop rocking a Ryzen 7 3700U with Vega 10 graphics. All other specs are the same. The Ryzen one is newer and has USB C. It also looks better but this is not a game changer. Honestly I told her to go with the Ryzen one. I've searched for some becnchmarks on the internet and it seems that the intel is just slightly faster. We are comparing here a top Ryzen CPU of the latest generation with an i5 Intel of two generations ago... Also comparing the graphics of the two it seems that the Ryzen one is much faster... The thing is her brother suggested her to get the Intel one. Which one shoud she choose? This includes if possible the question of the quality of the display and the battery life. The build quality is another important factor but even if you don't have experience with those laptops a quick answer regarding which system is better is more than welcome! Thank you very very much in advance! Edit She wants to use the laptop for mostly office work as she manages some Excel tables she plays some light games GTA 5 CS GO and some others and she does light Photoshop editing. Also if you have suggestions from other manufacturers please tell me. Those two laptops are at sale so this is why we chose them. Edit 2 This DELL laptop is rocking an i5 10210U with a Radeon 610 graphics card and this Asus has an i5 1035G1. Both are very good options. Do you suggest getting one of those instead?,0.018,0.85,0.132,0.9908,1,1

I don't game or anything on my laptop and I am allowed access to desktop computers at my university for intensive things like video editing so these things aren't a major thing. I don't really have a massive budget as I'm going to a different country for uni so I'm putting aside as much as I can to help support me and I can't bring my current laptop as it's too heavy and slowing down. I really enjoy writing my own notes in class so I'm interested in a 2-in-1 style as I would be able to write them straight away rather than type them or scan them but this is not an essential feature. I'm not super fussed about brand names either e.g apple mac .

Ive seen a ton of Dell hate when looking this week but dont know if that is true or not. Or other brands i'm not familiar with Acer Thinkpad etc. Minimum specs I need for my programs •Minimum 8gb ram preferably 16gb •Really high end graphics card. I don't know much about computer parts but anything high-end gaming is good for our software. Not the highest end of line but something pretty powerful. 8 /10 you know? Detailed video graphics modeling and rendering. Constant 3D interface and modeling. •125gb or higher ssd for software. Preferably built in storage of 1tb This is the main problem with my current laptop. Always running out of room on my C drive programs cant be moved etc. •screen size and resolution aren't super important but preferable 15inch minimum and relatively good quality Ive been browsing a ton and have a few ideas. What are your thoughts? Budget is 1000 - 2000 probably tops 1. MSI WS65 is absolutely a stretch budget-wise. But is it worth this crazy pricetag honestly? Is it truly top of the line? Probably not going to be the one for me but wanted to toss it up here. 2. Dell Something It seems like a powerful machine but why is is so cheap in comparison? Should I avoid Dell? Or is this not actually a nice laptop for my needs? Not sure about that graphics card especially. 3. Asus Zenbook I seem to like as well but feel this graphics card is not too powerful. 4. ASUS ROG Zephyrus G also seems too cheap for its specs is there something I should be weary of? 5. ThinkPad P73 Mobile Workstation seems very good for the Memorial Day Sale price. Probably my current choice. Is that graphics card any good? 6. ASUS ProArt Studio Book Pro w700G3T is kind of out of budget but seems worth it for its cost. Does this have very good graphics? Or is it just overpriced and aimed at Art Students Sorry for the long post but just want to get some more opinions before I look at anything. Thank you for your help!

The situation is that my sister has a 3 year old 7th Gen Intel core i7 HP envy laptop that is 2in1. The power button is broken battery life is average screen is not that great and the durability is starting to degrade. My sister usually watches alout of movies writes alout of Word documents for research. She doesn't play any games at all however in the future she might start on photo editing. She opens alout of tabs on Google Chrome and has multiple apps in the background. Her laptop has fallen a couple of times . The requirements she wants from her new device is - great battery life - good display that is bright and good for watching movies - speakers should be good enough - light weight and not too heavy - at least 512GB of storage -15 or 13inch laptop - Price MAX 1200 I was thinking to get her a new 10th Gen Intel core i7 laptop from HP with good battery life display and is light weight but not too expensive. However then I started looking at iPad pro 2020. It is more powerful than most windows laptop has great camera display battery life is good and can last for long periods of time. However I have watched many reviews from people who say that the software still needs improvement but since my sister is interested in getting an iPad for a while and is okay with getting one I was going to buy it. However I am considered about the functions that windows laptop have that iPad OS doesn't. I also was thinking about MacBook Air but they are too expensive and I have read many articles saying that if they break and you don't have warranty then it's expensive to repair. The reason why I need your help is to give me your opinion on whether is it good to get her an iPad pro 2020 or just get any windows laptop form HP or Dell other brands I don't know but open to suggestions or get MacBook Air.

They both have 32Gb of ram and i would use them for a mixture of uni work real work and gaming. I currently have the last gen zenbook pro without the second screen an i7 HQ processor 8gb of ram and 1050 gpu but it has now broken. I have been pretty disapointed with build quality after 2 years it is extremely tired the charging port has broken and the frame has warped the thermal throttling was frustrating and i always wished it had more umph in the ram and gpu departments. On one hand I love the versatility of the surface book the fact it turns into a tablet would i really use it in this mode though? and the fact i can touch and write on the main screen with the pen. It also has enough power for some gaming with the 1660 ti max q gpu whilst remaining slim with great aesthetics. On the other hand i also love the zenbook pro duo with that second screen i would genuinely use that all the time it is also way more powerful with an i9 hk cpu and rtx 2060 graphics the downside is it's pretty big and there are reports of poor build quality which would make sense as my current zenbook pro is pretty poorly made . It also just doesn't look as crisp and clean as the surface book to me and the stylus seems like a bit of a gimmick as the touch screen is so small Which one should I get and why?

I asked all my friends with MacBooks and also all my friends with other Laptops Acer Lenovo Asus... but I always end up with the same results 50/50.

The Acer on the other hand would have an Intel i7 10th Gen Quad-Core with max. 3.9Ghz 16GB RAM and 1TB of SSD. The Acer also has Touchscreen and a lot more port‘s while the Air only has 2 Thunderbolt ports i think. The Air would cost around 1500€ and the Acer would cost around 1300€.

Hi a friend of mine asked me for advice on a new laptop since I'm the tech savvy one in the group. The problem is I'm more of a desktop gameoverclocker myself so I don't really know if the software he uses stresses more the CPU or the GPU and I'm generally not that familiar with laptop hardware and how parts performs in relationship to one another. Considering what his budget allows and the sadly limited availability of these peculiar times we arrived to two possible candidates i7 9750H/10750H GTX 1660Ti Ryzen 7 3750H RTX 2060 The software he uses Photoshop Indesign AutoCAD Vray 3dsmax Rhino Revit Both configs have their pros and cons. For example Vray benefits enormously from the RTX 2060 but I'm afraid the 3750H's lackluster single threaded performance is gonna be a bottleneck in Photoshop and AutoCAD since AFAIK AMD really didn't catch up to Intel's single threaded performance until Zen 2. I know his best option would be to buy a series 4000 Ryzen but those aren't available yet and he can't delay his purchase. Thank you for your time.,0.035,0.875,0.09,0.907,1,1

It's difficult to find something decent because she needs French-Canadian keyboard layout and that's not super mainstream outside of French-Canadian circles.

I can't find a single review for this laptop anywhere but I did notice a number of HP laptops with no model names are being sold by Bestbuy Costco and others.

I am very new to Reddit after many months of lurking as a guest so please excuse any walls of text. I was looking for help finding a laptop to use at college for a Cyber Security degree. So far I have only looked at a few ThinkPads because I have an older one I use as a spare. I could buy a laptop from the bookstore but the cheapest option that my college offers for my requirements is nearly 1 700 I can afford this with some extra money I have from a cash scholarship but it just seems too high of a price. To save some money I would like to purchase one myself from money that I saved from working at my last college. I was told by several people I could buy a laptop elsewhere so long as I meet the required specs for my major see specific requirements section . Based on the phrasing of the page I need to have the required specs but whether or not it's a loose or hard requirement is not listed. x200B LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE Total budget in local currency and country of purchase.

Battery life performance build quality form x200B How important is weight and thinness to you? The laptop that I purchase will end up carried to classes in a backpack when in person classes resume so it is important to me. x200B Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent put N/A. My current laptop has a 15 screen. Something with that size would be nice. Anything from 14 to 17 would be feasible as my backpack can hold up to a 17 laptop. x200B Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. I do not play a lot of games other than Minecraft right now and I don't play very often. I am not sure how intensive anything related to Cyber Security would be on a GPU but according to my college's requirements they say I have to have a graphics memory of 2 GB. I am not well versed in GPUs In terms of programs I plan on using I will need to use an IDE for a programming class virtual machines and other cyber security related tasks. x200B If you're gaming do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? I am not very picky with FPS or settings low or medium setting in Minecraft is fine so long as it is not super choppy. x200B Any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ? For my major there are some guidelines set for laptop requirements. Other than the graphics memory requirement I listed above 2 GB I need Windows 10 Pro I know I can pay to upgrade later . The list also calls for an Intel Core i5 or i7 or an AMD Ryzen 5 or 7. 16 GB of RAM is needed. They also call for 250 GB of storage on an SSD but I think more the better I would like 512 GB or higher if possible . For my wants and requirements the laptop should have a webcam/microphone of passable quality a good keyboard at least one regular USB A port and an output method so I can use two screens at once HDMI preferred . A serviceable laptop ex. easy to upgrade RAM or SSD would be nice to have. x200B Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

Other option cheaper Lenovo ThinkBook 15 on sale for 899 from Lenovo's website Core i7-1065G7 Quad Core 16 GB RAM 512 GB SSD Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics is this better? I tried looking in the mobile GPU link on the sidebar and these are usually higher than anything labled Intel UHD Graphics . Newer model Lenovo ThinkPad E15 on sale for 1 070 from Lenovo's website Core i5-10210U Quad Core 16 GB RAM 512 GB SSD Integrated Intel UHD Graphics. Probably a very low quality graphics card given info from the link and my experience with a similar graphics system in my current laptop. x200B If anyone else has other suggestions or questions please add them.

1,gq61wu,SuggestALaptop,5,2020/05/25 22:43:05,Evening,What are the main differences between a gaming laptop and a Mac? Hi all x200B I'm currently looking at a computer before going into college. Because of my previous experiences with MacBooks and my personal interests I'm looking at getting a gaming computer namely an ALIENWARE M15 R3 GAMING LAPTOP which my friend recommended to me. I have no knowledge of computers so if y'all have recommendations I'd be happy to take them! But my dad is pushing for a MacBook mostly because he doesn't see the difference that much. And here my question is what are the pros and cons of both compared to each other? For me I think an Alienware would give me the most bang for my buck and give me a better ability to have the resources I need in college. I'm going into a major that would require me to use programs like photoshop which would kill my current mac But I would like to have an outside view of what you all think would be better. I don't really know what most of the technical terms are for laptops this is my first time shopping for one so I wouldn't know what that stuff means. x200B Thanks! EDIT he's the laptop form!

2,gq2wyt,SuggestALaptop,4,2020/05/25 18:44:40,Afternoon,Gaming Laptop for Child Hello all. I'm looking for recommendations for a laptop sort of spec-wise but mostly also reliability-wise. This laptop will be for an 11-year old who currently mostly plays modded Minecraft and Roblox but may get into some other games as she gets older. Most of the laptops I've been seeing are coming with 8gb RAM but I feel like 16 would be my personal goto at this point however if 8gb is sufficient then that would open up more possibilities. I also know that I personally prefer having just a single SSD instead of an SSD HDD combo but if people would really suggest doing the combo then can do that too. Overall just looking for suggestions. Some of the particular models been considering are ASUS TUF Dell G3/5 Lenovo L340 or Y545 ASUS Rog Strix II. The sales person at Microcenter yesterday also suggested the HP omen. Currently the best deal but now sold out that I think I've found is a TUF with a Ryzen 4800H 1TB SSD and 16GB 3200 ram for 1200. Is that a deal we should try pursuing or something cheaper? Budget I was originally looking in was 800-1000 but can stretch if it'll mean better value and longevity. Let me know if there's any questions I'm not answer too. Thanks!,0.014,0.903,0.083,0.9492,1,1

I watched a reddit review by CrystalRam on the laptop and everything he said about it is what i'm looking for. Affordable good performance solid battery life. Are there any downfalls to the laptop I should be aware about? Or any competitors at the same price rage that offer a better deal? The standard Lenovo IdeaPad comes with 256gb SSD. I'm currently on Mac and have replaced its hard drive with a 500gb Samsung SSD which has been in use for approximately 2 years now. Would this SSD still be in somewhat prime condition if I wanted to replace the 256gb SSD since I'm unaware of how long these normally take to ware down in performance if they do at all. Another thing is it safe and reliable to order a laptop online? I don't know if anyones had experiences with careless delivering or anything like that or if I can feel safe knowing that ordering it online it will arrive in perfect condition.

This weekend seems to be a good time to look with some memorial day deals floating around an a good idea of what the 2020 offerings look like. My budget is 1500 maximum and would ideally like to keep things closer to 1 000. What I'm Doing With This Thing Complex excel spreadsheets run at the same time with multiple browser tabs. Adobe illustrator or equivalent programs Adobe photoshop or equivalent programs. Some photo storage happy to use external drive for this . Light gaming if possible - not critical would like to run League of Legends Starcraft maybe remastered Halo/Halo 2 . Assuming frequent video calls now that a lot of things are remote/mixed remote. Planning to keep for 2-4 years so bumping specs would be nice for longevity. Screen Size Preference 15 would be ideal nothing larger. Smaller would be fine as I have a good monitor from my desktop build that I'll continue to use. Ports Full size SD slot is important for importing photos HDMI port for additional displays. Keyboard / Trackpad Fairly important as I'll be doing a lot of work on the go. Will likely pick up a separate more comfortable keyboard/mouse for design work and heavy writing. Screen Color accuracy is important for illustrative work bright high-quality screen is a priority. Hardware ideally 256gb-512gb SSD 16gb RAM. Not sure if new gen i5 is fine or if i'll want to spec up a bit for creative work. Also not sure how important dedicated vs. integrated graphics cards will be for creative work. What I'm considering New XPS 15 or 13 w/ i5 and RAM bumped to 16gb seems expensive for what you get no HDMI Acer predator 500 or conceptd 5 no SD card slot battery life / heat issues Asus zephyrus g14 no webcam no SD heat some lower end Acer books seem to sacrifice build quality/horsepoweboth . EDIT Macs are going to be off the table even though they are ideal for creative work - some excel addons have issues running with parallel / virtual windows and I'd rather avoid opening that can of worms. x200B Any insights are appreciated.

For years now I was happily using MBA and had no issues with it I am really happy with the flawless performance no lags no nothing plus safety and portability. Recently I bought an iPad Pro 12.9” because I need a “pen on paper” performance that is I am using it mainly for reading writing on PDFs annotating browsing many pages at once on Chrome etc. Since buying an iPad I use the MBA very rarely. However though I can do most of my tasks on the iPad using Office apps writing reading and annotating PDFs on great apps browsing a lot using email and most importantly taking an advantage of split screen there still are some limitations. Recently I was thinking about replacing my MBA iPad with one 2in1 device. It would be more comfortable to have all my files in one place I am not really using iCloud and the cloud service I am using is not available on the iPad and still being able to write on the screen. Also I think it would be cheaper because it is a bit devastating to invest not only in Apple devices but also in their accessories I cannot find a decent screen protector for the Pad even after spending much money on these . As already mentioned I am mainly using my devices for MS Office activities especially Word and Excel PDFs browsing and other postgrad school-university-writing etc. activities and sometimes light photo editing no Photoshop needed . I would not give up the split screen or touch screen function but I might be able to live without such great iPad OS apps like LiquidText. The most attractive option for the 2in1 so far seems to be Microsoft Surface Pro 7 or maybe even Surface Pro X. I read the negative reviews of the latter but I also saw some arguments that it is perfect for my type of tasks. Oh and portability! But I guess it cannot even load a full version of Office on its ARM. This means that SP7 would probably be a safer choice even for such simple activities I do not do any gaming video editing etc. .

Budget 1000- 1300 Hi I just recently started using very large data sets in Stata that my 2018 base tier MacBook Pro could not handle. When trying to load the data sets in Stata it would give me the spinning wheel and never load. It got to the point where I had to go to Costco and buy a laptop just to finish my work before finals. The laptop from Costco is the Lenovo LEGION Y740 which was 1 350 plus tax. I’m wondering if there are better options at a similar or lower price range. I don’t need a gaming laptop the graphics card is wasted on me. My main needs are something that can handle having 30 chrome tabs open articles and journal sites for data for my classes and Stata running large data sets. The Lenovo legion works for me but I feel like it’s overkill and would like to save some money if I can.

2,gpkwvu,SuggestALaptop,7,2020/05/24 22:33:30,Evening,Don't understand difference in laptop specs I have virtually no knowledge about different pc and laptop parts so I'm having a hard time deciding between the 13-inch macbook pro and the 13 inch macbook air. I know there are laptops that are as good for a cheaper price but unfortunately apple has made me unable to use any other laptop efficiently. I mostly use my laptop just for work but I usually have about 30 tabs and four applications open so my 8gb ram macbook pro gets quite warm and slow mostly because chrome eats up ram . I still don't think I need 16gb ram but i do want to maximise my efficiency and speed for the price. So my dilemma is between the 13 inch 2020 Macbook Pro 1.4GHz quad‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz and the 13 inch 2020 Macbook Air 1.2GHz quad-core 10th-generation Intel Core i7 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz . The Air is 50 cheaper but I really don't understand the difference and advantages of having one of the processors over the other. Both devices have an 8 GB ram but the pro has 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory and the air has 3733MHz LPDDR4X memory . Once again I have no idea what this means and I'm guessing the difference is probably marginal but I'd love to know just for my own sake as well.,0.045,0.827,0.128,0.9701,1,1

I have a few questions regarding this configuration and this is my first laptop purchase ever intended for starting college in the fall. Is the mx330 the 10 W or 25 W variant? Is the 512 Optane drive faster or better than the NVMe option? I also saw that Netflix won’t display 4K HDR on a device that has less than 3 GB of VRAM does this include all 4K content or just HDR? Also I am hoping that whatever laptop I buy will last at least 5 years I take really god care of electronics . With this said will this quad core hold up or should I try to get a laptop with 6 cores in hopes that it will last longer?

Performance serviceability and reliability is essential - I need a device that I can service myself if needed. And no I need to travel with this so desktop is not an option. How important is weight and thinness to you? Thinness is not that important - but I would prefer something below 2.5kg to keep portability reasonable. Do you have a preferred screen size?

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ? Keyboard/Trackpad should be good if not great. Windows precision driver . Biometrics is nice but not essential. Again serviceability is important for me. At the very least I should have the option to upgrade/replace my storage/RAM/battery as needed. Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. I think Lenovo Y540 fits my requirements perfectly but this is a 2019 model so does it make sense to buy one right now or wait for newer models? There's two models I'm leaning on One i5 with GTX 2060 or an i7 with GTX 1660. Among the two which do you think is more value? Lastly I am aware of the new ASUS Zephyrus G14. This also fits my bill but this is significantly more expensive here in PH around 2k USD and may also be harder to get due to limited stocks. Would you consider the price increase worth-it when compared to my preferred requirements? Other suggestions are also welcome . -- Thank you all for your feedback.

Most of the time he uses it at home as a desktop replacement and rarely he takes it on travel. I was thinking of a budget of around 500€ ordering in Germany less is obviously better if really necessary maybe a little more but not too high. I already took a first look online and at amazon and I was looking for models in that price range. I found 3 models that have nearly the same hardware which I will list at the end of the post but no idea which one is preferable maybe you can give me a hint. If there is something better in that price range I would be open for other suggestions of course. Models I saw Acer Aspire 5 HP unknown model Lenovo Gaming Notebook unknown model All basically AMD Ryzen 5 3500U Vega 8 Graphics and 8GB of RAM - SSD size varies of course but that is something I will evaluate at the end / is not as important.,0.042,0.921,0.038,0.0733,1,1

I have found two laptops the Helios 300 with an i5 9300h or a Lenovo legion Y540 with the i7 9750h. Both laptops are exactly 1 184 USD /90 000 INR. Both of them come with the GTX 1660 Ti a 144hz screen 16GB dual channel memory and a 256GB SSD. The y540 is 15.6 while the Helios 300 is 17.3 Which laptop would you suggest based on 1 Thermals 2 performance. 3 build quality. Is the i5 9300h a bottleneck ? I am leaning a bit towards the helios due to better cooling performance and full metal build. On the other hand I am attracted by the Lenovo's i7 9750H and the option to disable NVIDIA optimus.

I still have to use a laptop to do my projects when I'm away on weekends and it's especially painful to use this laptop especially considering I have a new PC at home.

I'm a junior in highschool senior soon and I'm duel enrolling until I graduate. My last laptops died from their batteries running out and i couldn't find a repair shop for them they were cheap. I'm looking for a laptop that's 13-14 inches like an Ultrabook size. I've wanted the surface book 2 but if there's a better laptop then I'll take it. I really like the versatility of the surface book and all the Microsoft surfaces but I can't stand how the others need stands. Ive rarely used my laptop on actual surfaces so it would just fall over if I got one of those. It has to be touchscreen and support a pen. I want it to be able to take notes but also draw some. I don't game super hard on laptops. Just basic stuff like Minecraft and gta maybe. Something that could run shaders with good fps. It has to have a lot of ram to handle multiple applications open. I also played sims a lot. The main thing is the battery and repairing. I have to have a long lasting battery and a laptop that I can easily repair at best buy or something. I tend to leave it on at night because I don't have a tv in my room and I like to sleep while watching something. Also I sleep on discord something so something that I can replace the battery on easily or for cheap. So good gpu good storage touchscreen with pen be able to disconnect into a tablet good battery life no soft keyboards/ stands. I'm willing to let go of the disconnecting screen as long as it's able to flip. I don't really know about the price. Cheaper would be better but it has to be a quality laptop.,0.041,0.795,0.164,0.9918,1,1

The performance is good on benchmarks and it just seems like a really good option all-around. Dell XPS 15 will pay 50 extra for the touch display - What I like about this one is also the amazing display but also the incredible performance. This machine crushes so many other laptops in benchmark tests. The only downside is that compared to the other two laptops I get a weaker GPU NVIDIA GTX 1650 but I feel like the performance can make up for it. I've had my Dell XPS 13 for a while and I can deal with the subpar thermal performance and coil whine. Eluktronics MAG-15 - The specs for the price on this laptop are absolutely amazing. They're double the RAM and SSD of the other two options for a lower price than both with an NVIDIA GTX 1660Ti graphics card. However I heard that the power isn't on the same level as the others and the display isn't as bright not as color-accurate and is a FHD display as opposed to the 4K displays of the other options. However as far as bang-for-buck goes this is the way to go. Anyway those were my thoughts on the laptops so please help me in my decision to see which is the best one for my purposes and budget. Thank you so much in advance!,0.051,0.754,0.195,0.9964,1,1

Currently I am going back and forth between an HP Envy x360 and an ASUS ROG Zephrus G. The programs I would need to run would be a mapping program called ArcPro a bit of AutoCAD and parts of the Adobe Creative Suite. I'm looking at models with the same processor so that isn't an issue. Mostly I'm just concerned with the increase in RAM and graphics that the ASUS has and if I really need that kind of power with the programs I'm planning on using. Also during these COVID-19 times is it super serious that the ASUS doesn't have a webcam or should I just invest in an external one? Thanks!,0.025,0.88,0.094,0.8821,1,1

I was pretty set on the HP Envy x360 at 2199 AUD I've heard good things about it and it even has a 4K screen which satisfies my streaming needs. But I was pretty worried about the hinges being weak. I'm not able to get the Ryzen 4700U version in Australia otherwise I would have gone for that. But then I saw a mention of the Dell Inspiron 14 and had a look at it at an even lower price of 1999 This laptop has the Ryzen 4700U as well as 16GB RAM and seems to evade the hinges issue which is very appealing. Buut… it SEEMS to be pretty thick which makes it hard to carry to and from school idk if this is true Does anyone have experience with either of these? Any other opinions are very welcome I'd love to hear about the pros and cons of each!,0.067,0.775,0.158,0.9692,1,1

1,gowxin,SuggestALaptop,8,2020/05/23 18:20:13,Afternoon,Replacement gaming laptop built to last Hello! I have an 8 year old Dell XPS 17 and it has been absolutely fantastic but I'm hitting the point where it probably needs to be replaced. It has an odd charger connection thing going on as of late and it can no longer support gameplay at the level that I'm hoping for. Thanks in advance for your help! LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE Total budget in local currency and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US Canada 1500. Preferably shipping from a Canadian location/source because adding the cost of duty/customs fees to ship from the US will chip through my budget very quickly. Are you open to refurbs/used? I'm hoping for this new computer to last 5-10 years like my current one has so probably not... How would you prioritize form factor ultrabook 2-in-1 etc. build quality performance and battery life? Performance would be pretty high along with build quality since I want something that will last. Reasonable battery life while doing office-type work would be nice but doesn't have to be exceptional. It will be plugged in for gaming and generally only running on battery for less intensive tasks. How important is weight and thinness to you? Sort of important. I know I'm not looking for an ultralight laptop I've been doing a bit of research and I'm expecting around 2.25 kg/5lbs but it's not exclusively for gaming so I'd appreciate if it was on the thinner side. Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent put N/A. 15.6-17 . It must have a full-size keyboard with number pad. Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. Some photo editing in Photoshop so I need to be able to calibrate the screen. Some gaming for example I'd like to be able to comfortably run Skyrim at med-high settings. I'll also use it for office-type work like MS Word and Excel and I average 30 Chrome tabs at a time. If you're gaming do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? Most of the games I play aren't crazy graphics intensive but I would like to play Skyrim at med-high settings at a minimum of 60 fps. Some level of future-proofing would probably be a good idea because I'd like to have another 5-10 year lifespan before replacement. Any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ? A decent or better keyboard would be preferred it must be a full-size keyboard with number pad. Reliable build quality is important so that it doesn't break down in a couple of years. I don't want a touchscreen or fingerprint reader but I don't really care if they happen to come with an otherwise good computer. I need at least two Type A USB 3 ports and a USB C. I'm very unlikely to buy any computer that doesn't have two SSD/HDD slots having the second slot be both SSD and HDD compatible would be nice to allow me to just drop my current data drive in . My old XPS actually has quite good speakers so it would be nice if I could find a replacement that does as well. Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. Is it possible to meet all of these criteria for around 1500 CAD? I've done some research and looked through some previous posts and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 has promising specs but their unfortunate keyboard choice eliminates that as an option also are Asus computers reliable? I have one of their phones and it's...not good... . Should I wait for more options with those sweet new Ryzen CPUs to come out?

Keyboard quality since I will be typing A LOT and a good screen since i will be staring at it A LOT. I like sleek looking computers and charging by USB-C is a must. Ive heard of people going macbooks and PC's so don't know which to go. I dont own anything apple though. Ill be focusing on software engineering and data analysis.

I haven’t had a laptop for years been mostly using my phone combined with Thinkpad from work when I need a PC. But I’m feeling there are a few things I want to do more that I want a computer for. - Budget approx 2000NZD could stretch for something good - Basic gaming - League of Legends maybe some age of empires. But not worried about high graphics just want decent performance. Would maybe like the option to muck around with some steam games in future but not a gaming laptop. - Good performance with music programmes like FL Studio and Traktor DJ - Good display probably around 15inch? And high quality - I have heard that a wifi 6 card is good futureproofing - Most of all I want it to last without getting dated. Ideally I’d like it to be fit for all the above purposes for the next 4-5 years without being likely to need repair. - portability is also important since I plan to travel with it I was always a windows guy and on the Apple hate bandwagon. But I have been using an iPhone through work and really enjoyed how clean it is to navigate and doesn’t look old even though it is a release from a few years ago. I have found windows laptops in the past seem to slow down and become clunky easily so I’m leaning towards a Mac but I’m happy for you to tell me why I’m wrong and where there are others that suit. Also interested in what type of specs I should be getting if I did go for a Mac Thank you!,0.058,0.739,0.203,0.9917,1,1

I am looking for having a separate Laptop and a separate Tablet combination instead of a 2 in 1. I would be using the Laptop primarily for CAD related stuff and the Tablet for digital note taking productivity and media consumption. I am interested in the mobile Workstations not the high end models though . Minimum specs that I am thinking of are 15 Intel core i7 16GB RAM 512 GB SSD and a dGPU. As I won't be carrying it so often weight isn't a problem for me. I found some pretty good deals specially for Lenovo and HP mobile Workstations from a local dealer here in Germany that are somewhere around 1200€- 1600€... I personally was attracted to Lenovo Thinkpad p53 and HP Zbook 15u G6 models of the Workstations.. Would these be wise options for a student looking for keeping the workstation for around 4-5 years without much problems? Are there any even better options other than above mentioned manufacturers? Should I wait for more promising prospects for new and upgraded versions of the Workstations or for price to decrease a bit since I won't be requiring one till my 3rd Semester of the university begins..? As far as the tablet is concerned Surface go 2 has caught my eye and is looking promising for the tasks that I intend to do on it. I was looking for 8gb/128 GB SSD model equipped with Intel Pentium 4425Y-Wlan. Would it be wise to get this model or pay around 80-85€ more for the Intel core m3? Also are there any other such promising tablets no iPads.. which are sturdy enough to be carried around the entire time and has super pen functionality for easy note taking?

I was looking at the macbook air but I need a windows based machine to do a small part of my job. It can work on a Mac after bypassing some channels but they reccomend a windows based system. I primarily use my laptop to do work excel/word google sheets/docs/drive and then just other basic web browsing for personal things nothing too intensive. I would like to keep it under 1000 if possible but willing to pay more for the right investment. Prioritizing longevity of the device and sufficient speeds so probably i5 processor. Edit Can't copy and paste the form on mobile but some additional notes - Located in US budget is 1000 - Open to refurbished options - I will not be gaming/video editing - indifferent to size/weight and screen quality,0.026,0.931,0.043,0.555,1,1

Really I'd be happy with anything from a tablet to a behemoth brick as long as performance meets standard. Longevity is a must - I don't want to be looking at replacing it for at least 5 years. It doesn't still have to be top-spec by then but it should at least be able to perform.

Hi guys thanks to some help from this sub I am going to buy a razer blade 15 I know it isn't the best laptop for everyone but for what I do it seems perfect . Now I know razer has their fare share of problems along the life of the laptop so I will certainly be purchasing a warranty plan for any mishaps along the ride and peace of mind. The two places with the best deals are Microsoft and BestBuy x200B Microsoft has the blade for 2299.00 and the PerformanceGuard Warranty 4 Years for 279 giving a total of 2578 tax. EDIT If I am not mistaken I also get an additional 10% off for being a college student at the MS Store so it could be closer to 2300 x200B BestBuy on the other hand has the blade for 1999 and GeekSquad 3 year protection for 339 giving a total of 2400 tax. I have heard both good and bad things for GeekSquad so I do not know it is my best option x200B Which one would you guys say is the better deal? I will be a university student for at least another four years hopefully not more and I would like the laptop to be functioning all four of those years. Is the 100 less worth it for BestBuy or should I go with the Microsoft deal? x200B If either of these are bad choices I can always go with a MacBook Pro 13 which fits my budget perfectly but does not have the most power and I would have to run a VM for solid works all the time ,0.078,0.737,0.185,0.9859,1,1

However a lot of people online who own MacBooks and have tried using Windows claim that it's trash and has many problems. Maybe it's because I've only used one OS but is Windows really that bad?

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. I will be doing some CAD work. I dont intened on much video or photo editing. I also dont intend on doing any major gaming either I wont be playing GTA V Skyrim or anything but maybe like terraria or LoL. I'm not interested a dedicated GPU I think an AMD processor with ryzen would be good enough. If you're gaming do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? Minor gaming. No triple a games or big games. I dont plan on anything crqzy. Any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ? I need reliability and would like decent customer support in case something happens. Everything else above seems minor compared to everything else. A touch screen would be nice but that's be part of a 2 in 1. Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. I need i7 or equivalent. An AMD with integrated GPU would be best 16GB of Ram I've seen 12 as well I think thatd be ok 512 SSD. I imagine I could get by with less but I'm a technological person and would like more. I said above I've have some major ideas in mind. 1 Lenovo yoga c740 14' 10th Gen i7 16GB RAM 1TB SSD 1920x1080 310Nits IPS for 1009 without warranty. I got sent a coupon for 100 for lenovo havent checked to see if this is applicabale . All in all this seems like a great option for me. I'm a little wary though. I've heard some horror stories about Lenovo issues and customer support as well as shipping times. 2 HP Envy x360 15ee000 touch. 1049 or 1159 depending on the CPU It's got option for AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6 Cores with Radeon Graphics 2.375 GHz or the Ryzen 7 4700U 8 Cores with Radeon 2GHz I think 4500U will be fine 16GB Ram 15.6 IPS 400 Nits 1920 x 1080. 512GB NVME SSD Intel Wi-Fi 6 or Realtek wifi 5. I think is a great option because of the AMD 5 4500U with Radeon which should be able handle all my graphical needs. I'm however not familiar with AMD processors will it be enough? I also have no idea what the hell is the difference between each HP envy x360. I see that with all the ending and get confused what is the difference between 15ee000 touch or the HP envy x360 15-ds0013nr or the best value? This stresses me out and In hesitant I'm buying an inferior version or something. I'd be willing to link either if you want. I'm leaning more toward the HP because of the Radeon Card and hoping to avoid Lenovo because I've heard nothing good about customer support from them. Let me know what you think. I apologize if the formatting is rough I'm on mobile. Thank yoh,0.084,0.757,0.159,0.9964,1,1

Just wanted to know if the base model for Macbook Air 2020 8gb of ram and i3 processor is enough to run applications such as Revit Autocad iRhino 3D etc.? Obviously the laptop would not be my main software but I will probably use it to run Autocad and other graphic applications from time to time. Im this case I am slightly concerned that the laptop will throttle and freeze during the drafting and rendering process. What do we think? Just opt for a different laptop or is the base line model for MBA 2020 enough? I don’t have the budget to upgrade the RAM to 16gb and opt for the i5 due to the price jump from 1600 to 2000 here in Australia so I’m kind of stuck with the base line model in terms of Macbook Airs. Also is the base line MBA better than the 2019 MBP? My max budget is 1700 AUD so if you have other recommendations within the price range please let me know.

I want this to last for 3-5 years before having to repurchase. I think I'd like to have at least i7 or equivalent type performance. A dedicated GPU would be nice but I understand that at this price point that's unlikely. I feel like I should only consider the latest generation of CPUs but would be open to other choices if the reasoning is sound. Also I would like some expandability - RAM and SSD should ideally be swappable/expandable. I know some notebooks like Lenovo have at least some soldered RAM. I'm leery of that because it locks you in with no way to milk your computer a little longer towards the end of its life. It's why I recently sold my 2014 MacBook Pro because I felt it was reaching a point where it would become outdated and lost all of its value. Also worth mentioning is SSD size is not overly important at purchase time because I do have a spare 500GB one that I could swap in if necessary. I'm also open to be convinced to buy/build a desktop for the same price range if it will better suit my needs but the idea of being able to go portable is one that I do miss since giving up my Mac and starting to work from home.

When I was just a little maggot I remember looking up the Dell XPS line with admiration. Their Infinity display was all the roar in those days. I eventually scrapped enough cans to buy a 15 inch only to later sell it to a friend and downsize to the 13-inch variant. If I only knew how many headaches I could have avoided by purchasing something else. But I liked the lightweight and modern feel. Every time I pulled it out of its sleeve I felt like.....I felt nothing. It was just a laptop and it was nice and compact and the battery life was great. Fast forward a year or two because that's how long the damn thing lasted. First the hinge broke and I had to glue it back together with cum and crazy glue. That's the only way to put it back together I was told. I hated the camera placement but other than that it got worked until it didn't. I didn't like the soldered RAM and the only thing user-upgradable was the SSD. So now after removing CMOS battery and battery and trying to turn it on I know that it has internal issues. And it's not the charger. Maybe the motherboard or maybe the father left and now I'm a technologically orphaned. These things happen. I'm looking for a cheap or extremely budget-friendly laptop that is reliable. I'll never again touch another XPS for as long as I am human. I prefer buying base models and upgrading myself to 16GB. I have a 1TB Samsung Evo SSD that I will recycle and install in whatever I buy next. All of my life long porn collection and personal files are still there and although it hurts to lose money I no longer have warranty and I refuse to pay hundreds of dollars to fix it and would rather keep moving forward and never look back. I'm looking for something with the latest intel 10th gen 3 or 5 7 is not necessary and costs more. More important than it's an IPS screen and has upgradable memory and storage. budget is definitely below 500 but preferable 300 including taxes. Is eBay my only option? refurbished? Am I trash now?

I'm looking for a laptop Max Budget around 2k-2.5k that doesn't have to be good at gaming but its really important that its really good at running any kind of photo or video editing software lightroom photoshop sony vegas maybe etc. I was looking around for a bit and saw that Ryzen cpus really outclass Intel on that so i'm definitely looking for a ryzen. I also heard that the IPS kinda screen would be the best. way better a TN screen so it should also have a IPS screen. Thanks you for reading this as I am quite clueless in laptops and would rather have some more experienced people look for the best kind of laptop.,0.02,0.805,0.175,0.9834,1,1

I’d been using as work and personal since we are required to bring it home each night. However the company recently had security software installed so it now limits use of social media and streaming sites. My current personal laptop is old af has crashed and been rebuilt twice in the last 10 years and it’s big and bulky and broken in some spots and I just don’t want it anymore. I really like my work computer the size speed capacity and sleek look but it is out of my budget. I’m looking for something fairly similar. - Budget 600 USD before tax/shipping/etc. - I am open to refurbished with a good return policy but also still kind of nervous about it... - I’d prefer 13.3” screen but open to 14”. Would like to keep it as compact lightweight and thin as I can without going too small. - Would mostly be used for watching movies playing music storing photos web browsing minor photo/video editing creating and storing documents - I love the Bang and Olufsen audio on my work computer and want this feature on my personal although I’m open to alternative audio suggestions - Must have HDMI at least 2 USB 3.0 A standard audio jack and 1920x1080 resolution - 8GB RAM preferred 256GB drive capacity but could get away with 128 because of cloud storage options - I don’t really care if it’s touch screen or 360 I’ll probably never use it in tablet mode. the fingerprint feature seems nice but not a must. - Two actual buttons on the touch pad and privacy screen are also preferred but not required - I am pretty comfortable with HP brand and don’t know much about other brands. My old personal laptop is an Acer and wasn’t too bad for a 300 laptop 10 years ago. My derby league laptop is a Lenovo and also seems like decent quality. I am open to suggestions on brand. I think that basically covers what I’m looking for. I’ve found several HP options I like but I am generally unsure if I’m getting a good deal or not. With them being in the 550- 600 range I want to be certain.,0.039,0.831,0.13,0.9881,1,1

I'm looking to buy a laptop that I can use for the next 4 years as I am going to university this fall. I would like a laptop that is good for notetaking watching videos and some games such as CSGO R6 Stardew Valley. I did some research beforehand and thought the Surface Book 3 with the 13.5 screen would be a good choice because of the portability good screen quality and the Nvidia 1650 which would be fine for the games I mentioned above. Another option I was interested in was the XPS 13 2020 which would be great for portability but not so much for gaming. Total budget in local currency and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US I would like the budget to be 3000 in Canadian dollars I've saved up some money from my job and want a quality laptop that can last throughout the years Are you open to refurbs/used? I would personally prefer brand new. How would you prioritize form factor ultrabook 2-in-1 etc. build quality performance and battery life? I don't mind if the laptop is an ultrabook or a 2-in-1 which is why I am already interested in the Surface and XPS series. Build quality is very important to me but I don't think that should be a problem given the budget that shouldn't be a problem. Performance should be good enough for managing multiple tabs handling some decent games with above 30 FPS. I would prefer the battery life to be above 7 hours. How important is weight and thinness to you? I would want the weight to be less than 3.5 pounds. A thin laptop would be preferred only because that would reduce the weight so not that big of a deal. Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent put N/A. 13 -15 Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. Doing some decent gaming from time to time the games I usually play are CSGO R6 Hearthstone Stardew Valley Minecraft. If you're gaming do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? Games mentioned in the question above for CSGO HS Stardew Valley and Minecraft I would want the FPS to be above 100 and I don't expect that much for R6 so that doesn't matter to me. Any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ? I am going to be using this laptop daily and a good keyboard would be essential for note-taking. Touch screen intrigues me especially with the form factor that surface devices have because I would love to take my notes on a touch screen surface and think that it would be easier to manage but I can certainly live without it.

However if I was to consider something more in line with a high end new gen graphics card like in the nvidia supers intel is what I find to be paired with that. However I am concerned about thermals and from what I have read many intel laptops seems to suffer more often with high temps. I want the mobility of a laptop and would ideally like to have a new laptop by some point this summer. However I am definitely prepared to wait if better more intriguing technology is coming out later this year.

I am pushing into a career involving light video editing adobe suite and do a bit of music production / composition on the side. My current refurb SP4 is not doing well keeping up and I'm looking to purchase a laptop that will last me for the next few years. I am unsure of what is needed for video editing purposes and is really where I need help. Coming from a 2-in-1 my research points at the 2020 versions of the ENVY x360 15z and the SPECTRE x360 1800 . I am shopping in the US and my budget sits at 1800 before tax Envy x360 15z 1300 - Ryzen 7 4700U - 16gb ram - 512gb SSD - FHD Display Spectre x360 15 1800 - 10th gen i7 10750H - NVIDIA GTX 1650ti - 16gb ram - 1tb SSD 32gb Optane - 4k OLED display The storage isn't a concern for me as I already use a good amount of external storage and I'm not fussy about displays I don't plan on editing in more than 1080p either . I'm a console gamer but it would be cool to do some low end portable gaming here and there. I also would much prefer a 15 screen as opposed to the 13 models. Although I'm comfortable getting the Envy are there any big considerations to get the Spectre instead particularly for future-proofing / video editing? It seems there aren't many reviews for either laptop as both are recent releases but their improvements upon 2019's models seem worth the buy. I am also open to the Dell XPS 15 2019 if you would suggest that instead. This is going to be my big pc purchase for the next few years so I'm hoping to last a while with these machines. It feels like any of these would do the job and I'm splitting chin hairs. Your help is greatly appreciated!,0.041,0.852,0.107,0.9766,1,1

The main things it would be used for is video/photo editing streaming video and occasionally some light gaming. I’ve been trying to do some research myself and have been following the recommended system requirements for the editing software that I use Vegas Pro which can be seen here Initially looking at these requirements I was hoping to get something with at least 16 GB RAM a 7th Generation Intel Core i7 or equivalent or better and at least a 15” screen. My budget is between 1000 - 1400 CAD ideally on the lower end of that range but from what I’ve seen I know that may not be possible. Any recommendations on something that might work at this price point? I was eyeballing 2 different gaming laptops the GF63 10SCXR-086CA Thin and the Alpha 15 A3DDK-012CA both by MSI but I have no idea if it’s a good idea to get a gaming laptop if the primary purpose won’t be for gaming.

I am a student that does some extremely light gaming but need a new laptop to last and be portable. I'm currently weighing up between these two laptops HUAWEI Matebook 13 783 or Dell XPS 13 19 919 - I get 15% off on student discount and then a further 100 off on an AMEX deal that's why it is cheaper than the 1199 sticker price. I am aware that the XPS is the gold standard ultrabook however for more price you only get a 256gb SSD in comparison to the HUAWEI. Also the XPS is of greater build quality and processing speed. But is it worth the extra 130? Many Thanks,0.018,0.912,0.07,0.7876,1,1

MSI also has 3 cooling fans and also has a brighter display but XPS is also bright and has more display area cm2 and the display is also taller for about 1 4 cm which is better for coding. Could both laptops be charged with thunderbolt from for example powerbank? Can I connect my Dell S2719DC with USB-C to both of these without plugging charger? If yes then I should plug charger only to laptop or monitor because I don't know which one will be charged ? Size of a battery doesn't matter.

2,gnsrn6,SuggestALaptop,4,2020/05/22 00:08:48,Night,Lightweight laptop with mid-range gaming potential I've got two laptops in the house a 4yr old gaming laptop and a 2yr old one for family use. The 2yr one just broke it's a Dell and apparently needs 300 repair so I figured I'd replace it. This is in the UK . Budget is ideally 1k although I'll go up a bit higher for the ideal machine. Since I don't get the chance to get a new laptop very often I thought I'd get something that was okay to run games on - I'm not a power gamer but it'd be nice to do better than that 4yr old model with a 970M graphics card. We don't take laptops out of the house and so there's no need for a big battery as we can just plug it in. They do however get taken from room to room a lot and used on laps so we need something that's light and run quietly. I'm aghast at the current fashion for small storage on laptops. I know a lot of people store data on the cloud but that can be inconvenient and it's no good for saving large games. Unless I'm missing something here? So something like ... - 15 or 17 light quiet and cool running - Dedicated graphics at least around an Nvidia 1650 ideally 1660 - 1TB storage don't care if it's HDD or SSD although I'd want a small SSD for boot obvs - 16GB of RAM The problem is it's hard to get machines with a decent graphics card that are light quiet and cool running . It also seems quite hard to find one with a storage drive. Dell have a 14% flash sale on at the moment and I'm quite tempted by an XPS 15 with 1TB SSD and 16GB of RAM for 1.3k. But I've heard bad things about Dell's reliability and it only has the 1650 graphics card which is a bit weak for the price.,0.107,0.792,0.1,-0.3776,-1,0

If I go with Mac I will most likely run a VM or bootcamp it to run solid works.

I would appreciate a recommendation for a laptop that will be my only machine. It will be used for everyday/home/personal use and Linux software development so a MacBook pro is not a practical option as well as multi-day travel several times a year. No gaming. Here are my wants and needs - Keyboard durable firm key activation force at least 1.3mm of travel firm bottoming-out feel not too noisy dedicated Home End PageUp and PageDown keys for faster text editing preferably black keycaps preferably dedicated media play/pause forwards and backwards keys. Palmrest areas should be metal not plastic or rubbery gummy material i.e. that crap on the Dell XPS . The typing experience is very important as I’m using the keyboard all day. - Screen 400 nits of brightness good refresh rates/no visible ghosting good color reproduction and accuracy must have touch functionality I need to be able to test my and other people's work for touch friendliness full HD resolution is preferred but 4K is acceptable no WQHD or other weird resolutions . Size-wise I like 13.3″ – 14″ screen sizes but would consider a 15-incher if the case isn’t so big that it impedes portability in a backpack. - Trackpad smooth ideally glass-covered surface large but not too large button is durable and will last a long time uses Microsoft Precision drivers on Windows sign of good-quality hardware . - Speakers Reasonably loud quad or more speakers with at least two being forward/upward firing ideally with some woofers for at least a bit of bass. None of this nonsense with shipping two tiny 1 watt down-firing speakers and marketing it as an immersive 360 degree surround sound cinematic premium audio experience! - GPU If the machine has a discrete GPU it has to be disable-able in the BIOS. Ideally integrated only and in particular I'd like to avoid a discrete NVIDIA GPU. - Case durable rigid metal ideally doesn't look stupid or blingy or flashy. Needs to be easily portable as I will be traveling domestically and internationally with only a backpack so it can't be too heavy or take up too much space in there. Would prefer at least one full-sized USB-A port. - System/specs optimized for compiling code i.e. multi-core CPU loads. 16 GB RAM and 512GB SSD preferred. - Battery life higher is better obviously. My current machine is a 2016 HP Spectre x360 which has met these needs for the past three and a half years but is starting to fall apart literally from hard use. However the latest model will not work as they worsened the screen and the speakers. So far the HP EliteBook x360 1040 Gen 6 is my top choice but its CPU performance is not good which seems especially silly given its high price and the AMD 4-series CPUs rolling out right now.

My main purpose for buying the laptop is to run CAD software such as Solidworks AutoCAD etc I still do not know precisely which CAD software I will primarily be using yet I understand that the general consensus in the CADing community is that a PC is better to run CAD software on. However I have also heard that PCs tend to not last very long and that a Mac is way more stable. In addition I can use bootcamp/parallels on my Mac which should overcome the problem of CADs needing a windows system. A Mac is a little more expensive than a Dell but if it has a longer lifetime and the overall experience is better it might be worth the difference. Below I have included the specs for each model.

I’m looking to upgrade semi-soon from my old 2013 macbook pro which did everything I asked of it for the most part but I’d just like a bit more. I would like to do a little bit of gaming on it but let me clarify Whatever laptop I get will not be my primary gaming device. I just want to be able to sync an xbox controller to it and be able to play single player games for a few hours maybe on a plane or in an Airbnb or whatever. It would be nice knowing that it could handle anything I could conceivably throw at it but I’m afraid I’d be wasting this laptop’s potential and would be better off with a more well rounded laptop. I’ve also looked looked at laptops like the newest HP Spectre configured with Intel i7 16GB RAM Intel Iris Plus Graphics Or HP Envy x360 which you can get with AMD Ryzen 7 3700U 16GB RAM and Radeon Vega 10 Graphics Could I meet my gaming needs with either of these? GTA 5 playing offline...Maybe the newest FIFA game? I’m used to console gaming so I don’t need 144hz or extreme high quality graphic settings although I do prefer things looking nice. My new laptop will only be about 10% for gaming. I do like the fact that the G14 can handle just about any program or game and the technology in it would hopefully not be obsolete in the next 3-5 years but if the HP’s I mentioned which have a webcam great keyboards quiet fans better screens better battery can handle my midlevel gaming needs for the same price it seems that I should lean towards them. Or am I looking at this wrong...Does the G14 have as satisfying of an everyday productivity experience as any other top notebooks? If you ignored its gaming capabilities for a moment would it still be a great laptop? Open to other suggestions of similar specs and price 1500 or lower good aesthetics good battery curious if there are any upcoming releases I should keep an eye on. I’m in no rush and can be patient for the right device or deal. Thanks all in advance!,0.034,0.779,0.187,0.9968,1,1

I have about 2 000-2 500 USD to spend on something that will stay on my desk most of the time I already have a surface pro for travel . I live in a cramp place and I tend to move every year so I'm considering replacing my iMac with a 15 inch laptop. Except that now the XPS 17 is smaller than some 15 inch laptops and MBP 15 is now the 16 I do a lot of video editing so I want something with a GPU. I am also thinking about getting into PC gaming too I have a switch but I feel if I have a decent PC GPU I might not need a PS5 or Xbox since games on there tend to come later to the PC . So perhaps something around the RTX 2060 or 2070 which should I go for? my work is also willing to buy me a monitor too to use externally! Although I like using Mac OS I am leaning towards the XPS 17 or Razer Blade simply because windows has more games.. and being a Mac user for a long time.. I am a little bit tired of the same general design a bit. I am curious if I would really like the high refresh rate screen of the Razer Blade.. is it really that life changing? . but at the same time worried about its long term reliability due to its reputation my work is paying for it but I still want it to last . XPS 17 and Dell might be better in that regard I consider the MBP 16 to be the safe choice I will simply just buy it with a larger hard drive in order to accommodate Windows dual booting for gaming.,0.031,0.895,0.074,0.9278,1,1

BUT the charger port started to die/malfunction. It only charges when I get the cord in a very particular position and even that is infrequent. Amazon where I bought it is out of stock. I can probably send it to Acer to get it fixed but that's a pain in the butt and I'm concerned how long it'll take. I'm considering just returning it and finding something new. Plus I'm concerned a new one would have the same issue in a short time. What's comparable both specs and price wise?

2,gncnzs,SuggestALaptop,7,2020/05/21 06:47:58,Night,A powerful laptop for running algorithms working with large datasets and ML/DL. I’d like it to comprise useful amenities and a nice keyboard! Hi all I’d love some advice from you lovely folks here as I don’t know what to buy and I’m spending a lot of money! LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE Total budget in local currency and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US I’m buying in GBP pounds or EUR euros in Ireland . For what I’m looking for I think I need to set the budget at 1200 minimum to 3000 maximum. I don’t think I’d really require the need for more money spent on it than that but let me know your thoughts. If it was worth it I’d consider breaking the bank a little bit more Are you open to refurbs/used? A new one How would you prioritize form factor ultrabook 2-in-1 etc. build quality performance and battery life? I priorities performance the most then build quality. Not too concerned about battery life as running the algorithms and processing large datasets will be draining on the battery anyway I’m ok to need to plug in. Not particularly interested in a 2-1 style laptop as I want the laptop to function for this purpose only and then just general use. How important is weight and thinness to you? I do like the appeal of a light laptop and thin screen etc however I am ok with a bulkier machine if it meant there would be higher performance. And with advances to the hardware anyway I’m sure the laptop will still be small enough Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent put N/A. I like a BIG screen! 15/17 inch or something. I don’t work with a second monitor really as much as I’d like and I like to split screen a lot! Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. No gaming or lightroom here! I’ll be running software such as rStudio eclipse pycharm Matlab. If you're gaming do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? NA Any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ? I’d love a nice keyboard for once lol! Throw me anything you think would be nice. Light up keyboard or I think I would like something like the Touch Bar from the new MacBooks. Handy and cool features like that. I do want the laptop to be nice and appealing as well as just being practical. A touchpad is necessary and I do want it to have at least the standard port capabilities Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. I want it to be able to cope with and be fast as you would hope for when processing datasets and running packages/algorithms. I’d like it to have a sleek OS and have high quality resolution/graphics processor and I think I’d need decent ram? I’ve always been a Windows girl but having been using a macbook 6 years old after my Toshiba broke I kind of prefer the cleanness I’d the design of iOS. But I do have some complaints about it so I would consider other OS. I’d also like it to stick around for a while 😁I know I can’t keep it forever if I’m making it work hard but if I’m spending a lot of money I’d want one that can withhold itself for 5 for so years,0.028,0.79,0.182,0.9982,1,1

3,gn865y,SuggestALaptop,11,2020/05/21 01:21:07,Night,High refresh vs 4K colour accurate So I’m deciding between a few laptops for the end of the year. The specific laptop will depend on how much they all cost when I actually plan to get one. Most of the laptops I’m looking at have an option between high refresh rate whether that be 144hz or 240hz or a colour accurate 4K panel. Whether that be OLED or standard IPS. I’m really conflicted. I used to be all for high refresh but when I stopped and thought about it I realised that the stuff I’m doing that’ll be important would utilise a 4K panel. This includes game design and video editing whereas the high refresh will pretty much only be useful for gaming and buttery smooth everyday tasks. This laptop will be for school and my parents want me to use an external monitor at home for ergonomics. This means that this info might transfer over to external monitors as well because that’ll be what I will be doing these tasks on.,0.013,0.904,0.083,0.9022,1,1

There's no need to run any video games. Of course my parents will be putting 2 kids through college so the price is an important factor. One that looks hopeful is the Surface Pro 7.

3,gmx87g,SuggestALaptop,5,2020/05/20 13:02:35,Afternoon,I'm looking for a good gaming laptop with decent thermal performance and VR support. Budget is 1500. So I recently got the ASUS ROG GA502DU-BR7N6 and I've had a terrible experience with it. Thermal throttling coil whine a lack of VR support due to the HDMI port being CPU controlled rather than GPU controlled and horrible driver support make me hate it. Before that I was running an Alienware M15 R1 with an i7 and 1660Ti which did support VR and seemed to run well enough in fact I loved it before I had to sell it for rent money. Now I have enough money to change systems and I was considering going back to the Alienware M15 R1 but I'm paranoid about thermals now and some reviewers of the M15 R1 have mentioned poor thermal performance. I never noticed any throttling on mine but with the current crisis going on and the economy being what it is I want whatever machine I ultimately wind up getting to be reliable for at least the next five years. The M15 R2 looks cool but I don't know if it will support my Oculus Rift CV1. Does anybody have good suggestions? I don't necessarily have a brand preference I would even go with a different ASUS model if it's proven to be more reliable.,0.096,0.797,0.108,-0.0516,-1,0

A friend of mine has a recorded a 20-25 minute video on her Mac with QuickTime Player. The thing is she wants to edit it but can barely do anything with this file as most websites and apps say it's too large it's 6 3 Go . She tried iMovie on which she had to cut the video down to 2 minute extracts to edit them one at a time and it wasn't functional anyway Filmora works but puts a huge watermark on the middle and when she wanted to transfer it to me an e-mail did obviously not work neither did WeTransfer and she couldn't put it on a USB key. She cannot play the video on her computer and re-record it with a lower quality since she doesn't have enough storage on her Mac for it. You guys are my last hope I think it's really unfortunate that even though she has the video on her computer and can view it she has to consider deleting it and start all over again.

So I got this macbook when it came out and I just noticed that it had been discontinued and it received a lot of bad criticism for its performance. No surprise. Back then I was pretty naive about specs and macs and wanted the cheapest route but times are different now. The programs Garageband Spotify Minecraft multi apps open I’ve been using heat up my ol mac like hell. It’s sometimes uncomfortable because of how hot it gets to even use anymore let alone rest on my lap because of how hot it gets. Don’t even get me started on the battery it drains quickly. Nevertheless it runs terribly slow under a lot of pressure I don’t blame it. It’s not built for that. But I am. I’m busy fellow school and gaming and doing music production. Sometimes I want to multitask as well. I want to upgrade my laptop to something more suitable for myself. I was thinking of going for that new MacBook Pro but started debating between 1.4 ghz with the i5 processor or the 1.7 ghz with the i7. Is there a noticeable difference? I want something that’ll last I don’t mind the price but I also don’t want to waste money for nothing either. I’m wondering if there is noticeable difference in anyway. I would appreciate any input thank you! TL DR - Is there a major difference between 1.4 w/ i5 processor and 1.7 w/ i7 processor? Cheers!,0.129,0.778,0.092,-0.9334,-1,0

I’ll be using it mainly for video editing on the adobe suite and I’ve got tons of external hard drive space so I only opted for the 1TB fusion drive. I don’t know a ton about computers but I’ve been a Mac user forever and I’ve had an 11” air since 2014 and it’s still in great shape. That said I couldn’t bear to edit video on it any longer I’ve cut far too many things on that tiny screen with only 4gigs of ram and it was quite tedious so I took a big leap and this morning after tons of research I ordered my new beauty! Since this is a Mac community I thought I’d share my excitement here and curious to hear anyone’s thoughts about this particular machine. Thanks everyone!,0.024,0.815,0.161,0.9771,1,1

It's running El Capitan and it feels like time for an upgrade. From what I've read Mojave is a safer bet than Catalina. When I got this machine I had the max RAM installed 16 MB and I had a second hard drive added. So it's got a 250 GB system drive that has the OS and Applications as well as a 1 TB drive for files etc. I'd like to do a clean install for the OS because I'm leapfrogging a few versions. Is there anything I need to do about all my files on the non-system HD? It seems like the kind of thing that could create headaches if I'm not careful. Thanks all.,0.038,0.835,0.126,0.899,1,1

Best Buy didn’t do their job correctly by fully wiping the MacBook and I didn’t even think to check that it was added to my devices in find my Mac. I guess the previous owner realized it was still linked to his account and he locked it on me. It went into lost mode out of nowhere. Unfortunately I bought the MacBook back in August so Best Buy is not gonna take responsibility because it’s past their 30 day return period. They sent me to Apple so I worked with Apple and because it’s a refurbished item and it’s in lost mode under someone else’s account even with proof of purchase they are not able to unlock it.

BUT i do plan on starting to do some video editing i plan on using the DJI Mavic Air 2 and record at 4K or 2.7k i also have a GoPro Which i always record in 2.7k. Im also planning on installing boot camp just for the fun of it i have two games that I play and that’s Age of mythology and war of Warcraft they are pretty old ass games but that’s the only reason that i need boot camp. So my question is which one should i get and what configurations would work well for me? Here are my following options that I’m considering. Mac Mini i7 1tb ssd for 1600 LG ultra fine 4K. But I don’t want to deal with the EGPu not working on windows boot camp this was my main option but I’ve read so much about how Bootcamp and EGPus don’t work. Also I don’t know how hard it is to upgrade the ram myself it looks easy but what if i mess up? Mac 4K i love the size of the Mac 4K its perfect it just sucks that i have to choose the ram and while i can do 16 I really want to future proof it with 32gb also the 1tb ssd is expensive and the 560x is subpar i would like the Vega 20 but if i add all of that I’m getting to the 3k mark. Mac 5K the ram is certainly one thing i like about it i wish the 21.5 had a ram door in the back. This ones come with the 570 575 and the 580x but some of them still come with the 8th gen chip. The thing that i like about the iMac is that the GPU is integrated and it works perfectly with bootcamp as opposed to the egpu with the Mac mini... if there wasn’t any issues with the Mac mini and bootcamp i would go for that option as it is literally a powerhouse. So what do you guys think? What should i get and is there an easy way to use an egpu in bootcamp and how easy is it to upgrade the ram?,0.031,0.825,0.145,0.9933,1,1

The ergonomics build quality and functionality supported by Logi Options software is top notch. There are two gotchas however if you have an old Mac. 1. MacPro5 1 has the Broadcom 2046 chip that only supports Bluetooth 2.1 so macOS will not detect the MX Keys in discovery mode in Bluetooth Setup. But Logitech's got you covered with a USB 2 Type A dongle that will enable connecting the old Mac to the MX Keys via the Logi Options utility. 2. MX Keys has no Eject button to open/close the SuperDrive unlike the old Mac keyboards that had one immediately to the right of the F12 key and unlike some older Logitech K-series Bluetooth keyboards did . An effective workaround is to add the Eject icon to the macOS menu bar by enabling it in System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Eject.menu. Even if you select the check box in Logi Options to Use all F1 F2 etc. keys as standard function keys MX Keys' F12 does not open and close the MacPro's SuperDrive tray. I hope someone finds this useful because I had to get to Tier 2 support with Logitech to figure this one out with the help of a macOS-savvy support rep.,0.01,0.874,0.117,0.9712,1,1

So much time has passed that the reclaiming policy has expired. Now I was going to sell them off to someone but I decided I wanted to see which one I would like better to keep. Since they have been locked remotely I think via find my iPhone I’m not able to really use these things. I’m wondering if anyone has had any luck managing to factory reset an iPad without needing the iTunes username and password. I really don’t care what’s inside these and I’d rather just factory reset them since I don’t want to see personal information. Thanks in advance guys!,0.014,0.831,0.155,0.9672,1,1

My 27 iMac late-2011 just died and I need to find an economical replacement to fill the next 2-4 years. I'm an illustrator that works 100% digitally on wacom and huion tablets. Corel Painter Photoshop Indesign and Illustrator comprise the majority of my work. I've been looking on OWC and Mac of all trades seeing what's out there and I'm pretty lost trying to figure out what direction to take. My old iMac had maxed out specs for it's model and I added ram up to 20gb over the years. I can get a late 2013 27 quad-core i5 4gb gpu for 1200 but there are lots of options up to 2015 on Mac Of All Trades for less than 1k. I'm totally lost. I've had terrible luck with the last one despite it's longevity. GPU replacement daily crashes etc. I just want this new one to work and hang on for a few years without any major hiccups. I'd appreciate any guidance you all can give. This is so far out of my knowledge base and I need a replacement ASAP for my work. Thank you so much!,0.052,0.873,0.075,0.7263,1,1

I've been using it for a while. I expected to take some time to adjust to the touch bar but honestly I figured I'd find it useful at SOME point and that simply has not been the case. It is NOTHING but annoying. I have NEVER thought to myself Ohhhh! Now I get it! This is actually pretty useful sometimes! The lightest touch with my finger which happens quite a bit activates the function or function key I accidentally brush against. I don't want to disable it entirely because I do actually need to use those keys sometimes.

0,gqjffs,mac,1,2020/05/26 13:10:40,Afternoon,I have a Macbook pro with a broken screen. I'm attempting to get it to display to a secondary monitor with no luck so far. Where do I go from here to try and get data off of it? Here's a previous thread on the situation when I first started this task and what I've tried so far Long story short this is a friend's 2014 laptop with a broken monitor. He doesn't want to pay to get it repaired he just wants to try to get whatever data is off of it. I've tried to get it to boot to a secondary monitor but everything I've tried so far has failed. I've tried to use keyboard commands to mirror to an external monitor those didn't work. Closing the lid and using an external mouse/keyboard in 'clamshell' mode didn't work either. In my latest attempt I was able to pick up a set of tools and found a guide to opening the laptop up and I disconnected and removed the laptop's monitor. Even with no monitor of it's own it's still not connecting to my external monitor. We know that the laptop seems to be functioning just with a broken monitor when the power button is pressed it makes the boot up noise. The only other thing I can think of is trying to connect it to another mac and using 'target disc' mode. Unfortunately we don't have access to any other macs to try this especially with quarantine going on right now. Does anyone have any advice on what I might be doing wrong here? Or any suggestions on what could we try next?,0.095,0.893,0.011,-0.9727,-1,0

Early caveat I’m not considering the 2020 models because they’re a bit pricey A while back I was gifted a used 15” Mid-2012 mbp and have since been using it for iOS development and browsing. This has been working ok but it’s rather slow and gets VERY hot while I’m compiling code with other applications/tabs open. Right now it’s still stock w/ an i7-3615QM 4gb of DDR3 and a 500gb HDD. Would I be better off re-applying thermal paste swapping out the HDD for an SSD and possibly getting more ram 8 vs 16? or making the jump to a newer model? This is the only MacBook I’ve ever owned so I’m not sure what the newer models’ 2016-2019 butterfly switch keyboards are like but I’ve heard they aren’t great. Is that the general consensus?

I bought a dongle so that I can plug in my Elgato Capture card my Blue Yeti microphone and a 4 terabyte external hard drive. Obviously It draws way too much power and tried multiple different methods like plugging in the Elgato using a type C to the macs port rather than the dongle and tried the same method with my external Hard drive but the mac kept saying USB devices disabled - USB device using too much power . I was wondering if there are any good dongles on the market that would allow me to have multiple devices like this without any issues? Or is this just not possible?

I’ve got a 2015 MacBook Air 13” running Catalina 10.15.4. I got it in the summer of 2016 and it’s been used quite a bit as I’m a university student and do 25-33% of my courses online. Back in the spring of 2018 my parents upgraded their wifi to fibre op. I don’t usually stay with my parents anymore and the house I live in has older standard-grade wifi I don’t know the specs rn . My university also has very basic wifi. Over the past 7-8 months my computer has increasingly had issues staying connected to wifi or even finding networks at all. At first it was ONLY the fibre op my parents had so I assumed it was a network issue as it would drop randomly on our phones tablets my parents iMac etc. The past month I’ve noticed it’s really gotten worse - my laptop will drop the connection at random and not pick it back up until the computer has been restarted. Today and yesterday it won’t pick up any network not even my nor my brother’s data hotspot. My laptop was serviced back in November for an unrelated issue but I did ask them to check the wifi adapter anyway and they said it had no issues and remained connected on their network with no issues. Google is just telling me to restart my router restart my computer forget the network reset the SMC done or get it fixed up. Does anyone have any other ideas or suggestions as to what to do?

1,gqctkd,mac,0,2020/05/26 07:21:15,Morning,Will a CPU upgrade help or is it time to move on? I'm beginning to dab in video editing and I've noticed my trusty old 12 1 might not be up to the task. I recently upped the RAM from 16 GB to 32 GB and swapped out the original 500 GB HDD for a new 1 TB SSD. The gain in performance is very satisfying but I still get dropped frames in FCPX 10.3.4 when dealing with original files forcing me to trans code all the media to generate proxy files for editing. I realize this kind of workaround is a common necessity and is precisely the reason why the feature exists but still I find the trans coding part very time-consuming and tedious. At one point during the process I thought a faster CPU might help speed up the trans coding process and maybe help during the actual editing? . I'm on the fence as to doing the CPU upgrade since I've already spent close to 400 on other upgrades and the actual replacement process requires tearing the machine further apart than I'm comfortable doing myself. Also it would probably be a marginal gain since as I understand it's the GPU the one supposed to be doing the heavy lifting here and as far as I know the GPU is not really upgradeable meaning I'm stuck with the 512 MB stock unit.

Hi all I’m currently picking between a MBA and a MBP and wondered if there’s any reason to think that a MBP will be more future proof than a MBA. In other words will the MBP last longer because of the better thermal system? I think the Air is suitable for most of what I would be using the laptop for but the cooling system worries me with it. I don’t want to be making a purchase only to have to replace it a year or two down the line. Thanks in advance!,0.038,0.882,0.08,0.4943,1,1

It is not EFI locked just iCloud lock Activate Lock . I met this scammer in front of the big restaurant.. hopefully they have a CCTV. The item was in a restoring mode that needs internet connection so I used my mobile hotspot to set up. It was taking some time but since I saw his vehicle license number and the type/color or car and the way he speaks unsuspiciously I thought it should be okay. I gave my money to him and then he left. Later the Macbook turned on with activate lock.. I texted him if he can unlock the macbook via icloud.com he never texted back. I tried to call but never answered I think he used a virtual number on the app . Before buying it he asked for a cash so I took a screenshot of chat his account info that shows that he is verified by email and text messages just in case. I have reported to police with his vehicle information screenshots summary. I have a police report number now. I'm embarrassed mad sad right now.. what if the police can do nothing for it?Have there anyone had a similar experience? ,0.058,0.895,0.048,-0.7958,-1,0

I wanted to use this SSD in my Mac Pro. I got the SSD out of the enclosure. Put it in the Mac Pro drive bay but I got a prohibited sign. I taught the problem was I was using Sierra and the Mac could only run El Cap. So I used an El Cap usb installedrive but when I want to install the OS I don't see any drives to install it on. Also in Disk Utility no sign of an SSD at all... So then I put in my good old Snow Leopard DVD and yes then I could see the SSD and install OS X 10.6.8! Now I taught to upgrade to El Cap by downloading the El Cap installer from the Apple Support site. But when the machine reboots to go to the installer I get the prohibited sign again... Maybe a bad SSD but it works fine in 10.6 and in external enclosures. So it has to be the Mac Pro. I put in an old 640gb HDD and this drive doesn't get detected as well. In System Information I can see the drive in the correct drive bay but it says 'unknown'. So weird it works with Snow Leopard but not at all with El Capitan. Any ideas?

It's in good shape and basically everything has been replaced on it through Apple repairs except the top case and the battery. The battery definitely does not serve my needs when I take it out as it has atrophied over time 180 cycles over 6 years down to 85% capacity . I may be in a place where I can buy a new MacBook Pro. I would definitely go for a 16 MBP with at least 2TB of SSD 32GB of RAM and the second-highest tier processor. With AppleCare it's looking like a 4 000 laptop. With this techie buzz about Apple potentially updating displays with Mini-LED and potentially switching over to ARM-based processors in 2021 I'm a little weary about spending that much cash on a laptop. On the upside I know Boot Camp will continue to work on it whereas it will be highly improbable if not impossible that an ARM processor will run Windows. Thoughts?,0.01,0.92,0.07,0.8687,1,1

Since some days or week my Mac Mini 2018 with 8GB RAM and 256 SSD is seeming to get buggy and slow. The programs are more often hanging or crashing Apple Music doesn’t seem to work properly anymore playback is stopping while adding songs to library etc and programs like Onyx also doesn’t seem to improve the situation. It seems that i am having all those issues since Catalina and I am really thinking about erasing the partition and reinstalling Mojave back again. Now I don’t know if I was building up too much unreasonable hate against Catalina if my RAM is maybe just not enough for my daily Workflows or if was carrying too many old backups with me that I was installing after selling my previous MBP 2012. The downgrade to Mojave seems to take a while so I don’t know if this would be the best way to go in my situation or if there are other solutions. I was noticing that my system and other seems to take around 100GB of storage of my drive and there i also don’t have a clue how this was getting so huge. Long story short. I am a long time Mac user who doesn’t know which path would be the right in my kind of situation- Hard reset with reinstalling macOS or some workarounds with more optimizing-tools.

I’m starting school this fall and I’m majoring in computer science. The launch of the new models makes me reconsider my specs and my usage cases in school considering my major is more heavily computer based. This makes me consider selling this current laptop on eBay to buy the new model with the 10th gen CPU 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage space. I would like to rely on my laptop to study and program. I also have a Windows PC with a 3800X and 16GB of RAM which I could use but it severely lacks the portability that the MacBook has. I guess I’m just here because I’d like to hear some other perspectives of my situation and maybe some experiences with some of the seemingly limited specs of the base model in more intensive use cases. Or maybe I’ll be good to go with my current laptop? Longevity is also important to me. I’m open to all suggestions,0.034,0.908,0.059,0.5719,1,1

Both are still running decently well but are beginning to show their age. I am now looking for possible ways to upgrade this setup. Since I have not quite been keeping up with hardware I am hoping for feedback to sanity check this. My requirements are Faster than either of my current machines Ethernet and supply dedicated graphics. I am mostly using my Macs for writing programming and RAW development but the occasional video game should not be out of the question. Ideally I want to avoid an iMac because the new models do not let me get at the internals as easily as my current model and upgradeability for RAM and Storage is quite low. I do not want to go with eGPUs as the current generation seems to tax the capabilities of the connector already and so this does not seem very future proof. Also I am not a huge fan of dongles. Mac Pro 6.1 Pro User-Upgradeable CPU Storage and Memory. Dedicated Graphics Runs the current version of OSX without patching Con Quite expensive for the performance The GPU is fairly bad apparently Spare parts are very expensive Mac Pro 5.1 Pro User-Upgradeable anything I can re-use existing legacy components SATA disks With a fairly modern GPU and a CPU Upgrade the machine is still quite capable today Parts and components are easily available Fairly inexpensive Con Upgrading to an even older design and old hardware lessens reliability Not officially supported on Catalina Might put me into the same situation in 1-2 years Macbook Pro 16 Pro Fairly powerful machine with dedicated graphics Will replace both of my machines Docking via USB-C seems to be the way to go for the future Con Non-serviceable Battery powered devices go obsolete faster Dongle-Hell to get all useful ports I am currently leaning towards the 6.1 despite the machine being comparably bad because it seems that this configuration might meet my needs for some 5 years or so enabling me to switch to whatever Apple might have released until then. The 5.1 is quite tempting as it appears that I can easily build a machine that matches or surpasses the 2013 in performance without being nearly as expensive. But software support might break forcing me to upgrade earlier Am I totally wrong?,0.068,0.821,0.11,0.9541,1,1

I am always working on music at home and that is why I am probably considering an iMac instead of a MacBook. Specially in these times when meeting face to face is not ideal. Besides portability why would I want a MacBook instead of an iMac? Also I am willing to spend around from 1k to 1 300 dollars. I am interested in buying plug ins for bass and for drums.

I needed some advice on how to proceed with a repaireplacement. TLDR at bottom. I bought a new 15 MBP Retina in July 2019 and in the last few weeks I noticed a lot of fan noise as well as the laptop significantly slowing down/heating up. I did some research was told it was a possible fan problem. I opened up the laptop safely both fans were dusty as hell. I cleaned them with compressed air and made sure everything looked clean. I put the bottom back on without anything hitches and went to charge it. This is when the charger kept connecting and disconnecting. I tried resetting the SMC but still to no avail. I reopened it to see if there was dust that I missed and when I did a few minutes later I heard a hissing sound. I put the back plate on and put in the charger. No charging sound no charge. It's a busted battery and I have to send it in for a replacement. Since no Apple Stores near me are open I'll have to mail it in. Will they just replace the battery or will they send me a new laptop? Also would the turn around time be longer than normal due to COVID? TLDR I have to get my MBP battery replaced/fixed. Do I just file AppleCare and mail it in?

1,gpw70t,mac,0,2020/05/25 11:55:44,Morning,Looking for clipboard software with specific features and finding it hard to find do you know of one like this? With my recent update from El Capitan to Catalina a utility I've depended on for nearly the entire time OS X has existed stopped working and I'm looking for a replacement. I see a number of clipboard managers out there but most of them are focused on saving a history of many past copies so you can paste old ones which is not what I want. I wouldn't mind having that capability it's just not what I care about. But all the heavily-featured clipboard managers have such long lists of features that I find it hard to tell if they have the few I care about and all the really simple ones such as plain clip do not. What I want most Lets me pop up a simple window that shows what's currently in the pastebuffer and lets me edit it right there. Hotkey to make that window appear is configurable - so I can have it be cmd-shift-C which is what is already embedded in my habits from many years. Some automatic transformations available so that I can do them without hand-editing. In particular - Strip formatting I'd like to be able to have this as a default so if I just bring up the box and click to save changes formatting is stripped - Convert to 7-bit ASCII... and do it smartly . For example convert to c œ to oe em-dash to regular dash smart quotes to regular ASCII quotes and so on. Other transformations could be nice too but those two are the ones I really care about. I want something that stays out of the way unless I choose to use it but comes up quickly with the click of a hotkey the key combo of my choice shows me what's in the pastebuffer lets me edit it if I want to and with a single click transforms what's in the pastebuffer to unformatted plain ASCII text. I've been reading through the marketing buzz and feature lists of a bunch of clipboard managers and so far haven't found one that definitely does the above though I have found a few that might and I could buy them one by one and try each one. But I really hope someone here knows one or at least can tell me which of the popular ones don't do what I want so I can save time trying them.,0.05,0.855,0.095,0.9775,1,1

That means that the newer Macs are getting slowed down instead of upgraded. Is there something here that I'm missing or is Apple pulling a sneaky on us?,0.048,0.884,0.068,0.3939,1,1

3,gppa48,mac,2,2020/05/25 04:58:10,Night,I think it’s finally time to replace my 2013 13” MacBook Pro... but with what? So I’m facing a Macbook dilemma... My faithful 13” MacBook Pro has 8GB of RAM the base duel core Intel i5 and a 512GB SSD. It’s reaching a point where it’s having difficulty keeping up with some tasks like editing photos in Affinity Photo editing 4K footage in iMovie or even just making video calls and browsing the web. My battery life tops out at maybe 2-3 hours and my hard drive always seems to be short on space. I told myself I wouldn’t upgrade my MacBook until Apple fixed the butterfly keyboard. Then the 16” MacBook Pro came out and everyone loved it and talked about how great it was and how it’s the best Macbook in years blah blah blah. Then rumors of a 14” Macbook replacing the 14” like how the 16” replaced the 15” started circulating and I thought “great! here comes a new laptop like the 16” pro in the smaller form factor I like. But then this new 13” comes out and sure it has a new keyboard but it still has this dated screen and last gen processors unless you spring for the top end model. It feels like kind of just... there compared to the 16.” Now it looks like my options are a larger and more expensive but very competent laptop or a smaller but more lackluster one. I’ve always preferred my 13” over the 15” I used to carry for work but these days my MacBook barely ever leaves the house while my iPhone and iPad have become my go to mobile computers. This has me wondering if I should sacrifice portability for the larger 16” screen and discreet graphics. My choices are down to a top end 13” MacBook Pro with the 10th generation processor at least 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD or a base model 16” with a similar configuration. I try to hold on to my computers for a pretty long time so I need something that will hold up to the next decade of personal photo and video work I can throw at it.

Setting up a new-to-me used Macbook Pro and I can still use Font Explorerer X 1.2.3 free version ... which is what I've been using for years on my iMac and Mac Mini but as I'm installing the software on ths Macbook Pro I'm presented with a couple options 1. copy fonts 2. move fonts Not sure if I should select copy fonts or move fonts and I don't like that it's asking me which I want to do because I don't know which is better at all. If I have it move fonts then maybe it's pulling fonts out of where they're supposed to be and I just want to leave OS X system fonts and Adobe fonts where they're supposed to be but if I have it copy fonts then I'm taking up 2x the space for the same amount of fonts. I like Font Explorer X because I'm familiar with it. It looks like all the newer paid versions have the same options to copy or move so regardless of whether I upgrade to the latest and greatest Pro version or stick with the free version I still have the same choice to make as far as copy or move.,0.054,0.857,0.089,0.856,1,1

English Hello everyone a few days ago I had a problem with my 2012 MacBook Pro and although I have made some inquiries and tests I cannot solve it the problem is the next a few days ago after having the Microsoft Word program open which had been running for a while on my computer for a while I tried to close it but it left the computer frozen with the color wheel in the cursor I had to force it to quit the program and when it failed I forced to shut down the computer after that when I turn it on at very random times it freezes temporarily with the damn color wheel on the cursor. Obviously I have investigated on my own before asking here ... the logical thing to think is that it is a RAM or PRAM failure and following advice from technical support I have restarted the computer with Option Cms P R for 20 seconds but that has not eliminated the problem. I also removed the entire Microsoft programs but it persists. So I wanted to ask Can you think of any possible cause for this? Before this episode my computer worked perfectly in this regard. Español Hola a todos hace unos días me surgió un problema con mi MacBook Pro de 2012 y aunque he hecho algunas averiguaciones y pruebas no consigo solucionarlo. El problema es el siguiente hace unos días después de tener un tiempo abierto el programa Microsoft Word Que desde hacia un tiempo funcionaba algo lento en mi ordenador lo traté de cerrar pero dejó el ordenador congelado con la ruleta de colores en el cursor tuve que forzarlo a salir del programa y al no conseguirlo force a apagar el ordenador después de eso cuando lo enciendo en momentos muy aleatorios se queda temporalmente congelado con la maldita rueda de colores en el cursor. Obviamente he investigado por mi cuenta antes de preguntar aquí... lo lógico es pensar que es un fallo de la RAM o PRAM y siguiendo consejos del soporte técnico he reiniciado el ordenador con el Option Cms P R durante 20 segundos pero eso no ha eliminado el problema. También quité todo el tema de Microsoft pero el problema persiste.

5,gpf42j,mac,3,2020/05/24 15:33:38,Afternoon,New iMacs are coming... Small reminder that it's been 430 days since the last iMac release average is 383 days . That can only mean we have brand-new iMacs incoming! When you ask? I'll bet you a hundred clam-chowders that new iMacs will be announced June 22 at WWDC 2020. So what could these new iMacs bring? 10th-generation Comet Lake desktop processors At the top of the list is the flagship Core i9-10900K that Intel calls the world's fastest gaming processor. The i9-10900K features 10 cores and a base frequency of 3.7 GHz while Intel's Thermal Velocity Boost can push single-core speeds to 5.3 GHz. It's also the successor to the i9-9900K chip currently used in the highest-end ‌iMac‌ configurations so it's likely the new chip will make its way into Apple's lineup. Natural replacements for the 21.5-inch ‌iMac‌ lineup include the new Core i3-10100 Core i5-10500 and Core i7-10700 while the 27-inch iMacs would see the Core i5-10500 Core i5-10600 and Core i5-10600K in addition to the high-end i9 option. New low-priced 23-inch-sized design Apple plans to introduce a 23-inch iMac in the second half of 2020 with mass production set to begin in the third or fourth quarter according to a China Times report spotted by Mac Otakara. Apple could likely achieve this display size by simply reducing the thickness of the bezels on the current 21.5-inch iMac. The report claims that the new iMac will be one of several lower-priced products that Apple introduces this year including the new iPhone SE and a forthcoming 11-inch iPad also expected in the second half of 2020. I don't know much about China Times' rumor reputation but even Gurman says rumors of a 23-inch iMac sound about right. New GPUs I'm excited for new GPUs but I don't follow AMD news so if anyone with knowledge of what new GPUs the new iMacs will use I will add that in an edit here and credit you. Thanks! -- With more and more people working from home for some of us it may be time to add a Mac desktop to the family. I was thinking of upgrading my aging 15-inch to a 2020 16-inch MBP also incoming but I feel a little silly buying laptops and keeping them in clamshell mode since I work from home and no longer do client on-sites.

Granted I bought them for 90 each at an auction a few years ago so I can’t speak to their history but still weird. One was a 2012 and the other a 2010 I think . The 2012 had a faster processor and I think the logic board failed. I can still access the files on the drive from an external mount so I guess it’s okay. The older one failed last night and it seems like it’s a drive problem. My question is if I install the drive from the 2012 might the 2010 boot up?

7,gp5b1z,mac,8,2020/05/24 05:55:29,Night,USB 2.0 issues on new MacBook Pro 13 2020 Apologies for posting with a new account but I would like to share an issue I've encountered that I think is widespread but I've not had a great experience with Apple acknowledging that the issue exists. This is my first Apple device so I've had to learn how to use it whilst debugging it. I work in tech and have been an engineer for years so I'm not new to figuring out issues I like to get to the root cause. The issue appeared on day one I contacted Apple on day three. Issue Symptom When I use an external USB-C hub in any port of my MBP and connect USB 2.0 devices that include a Filco keyboard and a Razer DeathAdder mouse... after a while minute or hours the USB 2.0 devices will stop responding keyboard dead mouse not moving or clicking . Debugging Maybe it's the USB-C hub? So I have used StarTech 7 port USB-C hub 5x USB-A 2x USB-C Satechi USB-C hub 3x USB-A 1x Eth 1x HDMI 1x USB-C power in Anker USB-C hub 4x USB-A Using any of those hubs with the 2 USB 2.0 devices attached at some point the devices will freeze up. Unplugging and inserting the USB-C hub does not solve it. Maybe it's one of the USB-A USB 2.0 devices? So I have used Filco Majestouch keyboard by itself still freezes Razer DeathAdder by itself still freezes Both of the above with all of the USB-C hubs I have still freezes Then a minor breakthrough If I put the mouse in any USB-C hub and put the keyboard in any other USB-C hub and connect these to any Thunderbolt USB-C ports... the USB 2.0 devices still freeze across all hubs at the same time This is confusing... as if it were 1 device or 1 hub I would not expect a synchronisation of it freezing across all USB 2.0 devices. Note that I am highlighting USB 2.0 devices as the USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 devices I have connected at the same time like an Elgato Camlink... are unaffected and continue to function normally even when connected via a USB-C hub that has USB 2.0 devices attached that have become unresponsive. So starts the research SMC Reset - does nothing... problem recurs reboots and SMC resets both resolve the issue temporarily but it will recur within minutes or hours. I contact Apple SMC Reset - still fruitless Press d whilst it boots run diagnostic all good - devices still freeze a bit later Left Option Left Comment or was it Control? P R - this is safe mode - and still the issue appears Disk Utility First Aid - all good but still devices hang Create a test user login as that and does it happen? Yes Apple support person it still happens Reinstall operating system - this is day four since receiving the new MacBook Pro and I've only installed Chrome and Firefox... but sure - as expected the issue remains. Apple provide a Capture Data.dmg utility and looking at this it's a script that just collates everything logs pcaps top process information everything... I run this and to my surprise the issue occurs whilst it is running. I send the capture data 311MB as a .dmg file to Apple Support. In the meantime something nags me... that earlier discovery that USB 2.0 devices freeze even across different simultaneously connected USB-C hubs. This is weird and suggests it's the Mac and not the hubs or devices. So I start to view Apple logo About this Mac System Report before during and after this happens refreshing the view constantly. What I notice here is that USB 2.0 devices behave normally until they become unresponsive but then as soon as they are unresponsive they will forever remain in the System Information even if unplugged from the hubs or re-inserted. This applies to all USB 2.0 devices. Anything that shows up as USB 3.0 behaves normally. I also notice that every one of these USB-C hubs shows a VIA Labs USB2.0 hub as the parent for the USB 2.0 devices. Then a minor discovery on a forum I found someone mention that they see an issue almost identical and that they have a workaround which is to use the USB hub in their monitor. So I order another USB-C hub my 4th in a week a CalDigit TS3 . I plug in the CalDigit and look at System Information and now my USB 2.0 devices are showing up as USB 3.0 devices connected to the Apple USB 3.0 hub. I use this and the issue does not recur at all... it's fixed. Hypothesis Apple has a USB 2.0 issue with either the chipset they are using or a Catalina bug regarding the handling and refreshing of USB 2.0 devices. However this can be worked around. USB-C hubs vary in their functionality and there are two types 1. USB hubs that are transparent proxies 1. The Anker Satechi and StarTech hubs 2. USB hubs that are terminating proxies 1. The CalDigit hub and anonymous person on the internet and their monitor hub Transparent proxies take the USB 2.0 input and present it as USB 2.0 to the MacBook Pro. The Mac or Catalina then will do something wrong and the USB 2.0 devices will freeze / become unresponsive at some point minutes or hours after being attached . Terminating proxies take the USB 2.0 input terminate it and present it as a fresh input that is USB 3.0 to the MacBook Pro. Everything is good in this scenario. Affected Apple Devices I know my MacBook Pro 13 2020 is affected and a friend has verified a new MacBook Air is also affected. For both the workaround of finding a USB-C hub that presents USB 2.0 devices as USB 3.0 devices works. What have Apple said? That they cannot see any issue in the data collected and my analysis even knowing the correct timestamp of when the issue occurred during data collection is that only 1 log file showed evidence of the issue... a single line showing that Google Chrome browser suddenly didn't see the USB keyboard and has switched to the Apple keyboard . Apple also say that they have received no other support calls that relate to this. I got the feeling that they think this is a user error. Related Links These are links I found that hint that the issue is more widespread Conclusion I have a workaround so I'm happy and now love my first ever Mac. But I'm pretty sure other people aren't going to buy 4 USB-C hubs and work through what the root cause is and how to workaround the problem. So I'm putting this information on Reddit hoping that others who experience it can self-verify whether this is the same issue and communicate that to Apple Support so that Apple prioritise a fix. Also to make it discoverable by Google so that if people are looking for a resolution to this issue they find this and can see a workaround is possible. I do super recommend that CalDigit USB-C hub btw... if I hadn't bought that my entire Apple experience wouldn't have survived a week and now I think it will last years.,0.041,0.873,0.085,0.9956,1,1

1,gpeq8a,mac,2,2020/05/24 15:09:39,Afternoon,MacBook Air 2011 This is a long post. But I’m have no solutions.. I use MacBook Air Mid 2011 . But I am having a screen flickering problem recently these past 2 months. Did not have this before no water spillage. Normal startup didn’t show any flickering at all. My OS is High Sierra 10.13.6. This is when I use Chrome as a browser and go on Apple’s website. Flickering in the navigation bar. URL Search bar has a white box some where near the end. When I use VLC as a video player sometimes audio will suddenly go off screen flickers and the app will freeze. These are the troubleshoot steps I have done and the problem still persists. I have done these individually and restarting my mac. Disabled Hardware acceleration in Chrome. Disabled graphics rasterising in Chrome. 1. Reset PRAM tried chime once and three times on startup. 2. Reinstalled individual apps and going on the sites with problem. Still flickering. 3. Reset SMC but power cable doesn't change light but fan is quieter4. Start MAC in safe mode screen still flickering. Loading user account from start up had flickers. Safari had little flickers. But Chrome was the worst. 5. Done a hardware test no problems at all on the list. 6. Clean install the Mac system from Recovery Mode formated HDD and reinstalled OS. 7.

I keep my music on an external hard drive. It's all organized the way I want it. I'd prefer to just pull the albums and songs I want from my Finder window into a music player to create a playlist. I hate how bloated iTunes is and how dysfunctional it is for me to use the Library to create a playlist. So much of my music doesn't end up labeled or categorized correctly in the iTunes library so it's a pain to use. I also don't like the Library system because I don't want the songs I add to a playlist automatically saved onto my laptop hard drive.

It was far worse before with the keyboard typing itself and I was unable to login. Now just a few keys are not working. Also my machine will not turn off. I hold the button down for 10 seconds but it boots up right after. I washed the display with a spray and wipe and I don't think there is liquid damage but this is all very odd as it was working fine this morning. Also thank goodness for autocorrect.

1,gpe5oc,mac,5,2020/05/24 14:34:54,Afternoon,How big is the battery difference between the baseline Air and baseline Pro if any? Evening everyone Due to an unfortunate circumstance I’ve had recently with a Dell laptop of mine I am currently in the market for a new machine. As my working environment is quite mobile having good battery life is a must for me. I noticed that the current MacBook Air has a smaller battery by about .4wH compared to the previous model 49.9wH vs 54wH which is certainly perplexing. Normally I would have gone with the baseline Air and called it a day but that’s when Apple up and released an updated version of the MacBook Pro. The Pro has a significantly larger battery at 58wH compared to the Air but it also has a more powerful processor to boot. Assuming that the load between the two would be similar writing documents / emails web surfing entertainment consumption would the battery life on the Pro be slightly better due to its higher capacity?

The laptop still functions properly when I connect it to an external monitor. I went to a certified Apple repair shop and after opening it up they said they can’t tell what the issue is but they suspect it’s likely the flex cables.

1,gpaxj9,mac,2,2020/05/24 11:26:14,Morning,I have Macbook Pro 2011 dual drive - Which Macbook to get next? I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro 13 with 1TB HDD in place of optical drive and 128gb SSD. I've been very happy with this setup because I have a lot of music and TV-series and I personally hate external drives every single one I've had got corrupted at some point and I would need to regularly plug them in to back them up on DropBox if that's even possible... Now I've gotten fed up with my Mac I can't install High Sierra 13 I still have 12.6. I can't import any videos from my iPhone OS 13.5 . My SSD which contains my system keeps going haywire and denies me permission to do anything on the drive until I restart. Spotlight doesn't always work. Every time I start my Mac I see some weird matrix kinda shit and my user account image is missing a piece. To me this all indicates my Mac won't last much longer. I think it's time I get a newer 2nd hand Macbook pro but which one? I would like to have at least 1TB memory and pay less than 1k USD or euro but still have SSD for faster system. If I have to go for a newer model I guess my only option is a single SSD drive but to have 1TB SSD would probably cost too much. So here's what I've thought of 1. Buying a 2012 Macbook Pro 13 . I've understood this is the last model that has an optical drive and is also compatible with newer OS but they don't seem very abundant right now. I also thought perhaps in the long term this is not the best solution. 2. I can see 2015 models on sale 2nd hand so I was thinking if buying one with 128gb SSD. I've understood I should be able to replace the SSD drive pretty easily in 2015 models so i could buy a 1TB SSD separately and install it myself I've done it before . This way the total price would still be a little under 1k whereas buying a 2015 model with SSD 1TB would cost around 1 3k 2nd hand.

Posting in case anyone else has had trouble playing games and has spent days looking for answers. Enjoy the pretty Mac picture D All of this information came from this website The answer I finally found was to restore from the internet. I spent days looking for ways to revert to High Sierra. Nothing in the Steam store would work with Catalina. If I want to upgrade I'm sure I can. You can create a boot disk with High Sierra so long as you once purchased it or you can use a Patcher and hit the 'Download High Sierra' and try to use Terminal to create boot disk using createinstalldisk commands. This is probably gonna save you a ton of time 1 Back up everything. 2. Back up everything to another drive. Seriously don't trust one drive to keep everything safe. They're 40 a TB throw one in the cart when you're getting rotisserie chickens and mashed potatoes. 3. After you're 100% certain you've backed everything up and want to proceed. Do so with caution. This will erase you're entire hard drive and restore it back to the pristine condition it arrived in. Not for the feint of heart - like some orange blob once said 'I take no responsibility.' Directly from MacWorld The first approach is to use a feature called Internet Recovery. Newer Macs are able to boot directly from an internet connection even with no Recovery partition available. Here is how to use MacOS Internet Recovery Shut down your Mac. Hold down Command-Option/Alt-R and press the Power button. On some Mac keyboards the Option key will be named Alt . Hold down those keys until you a spinning globe and the message Starting Internet Recovery. This may take a while . The message will be replaced with a progress bar. Wait for it to fill. Expect it to take a while... Wait for the MacOS Utilities screen to appear. Click Reinstall macOS and follow the installation process. There are issues with Internet Recovery. It only works with networks using WEP and WPA security. This is most home Wi-Fi networks but if you're on a proxy network or PPPoE then you will have problems. In these cases it's usually best to find another network rather than create a USB Recovery Stick our next step . If you have Internet Recovery then make use of it to reinstall macOS if possible.

I just found out that I can install a second HDD to the thing so I’m thinking of putting in a 250gb SSD and having macOS run off of that while the original 1TB sits in there for storage. Any additional storage could just be an external drive plugged into the back. I figure with an SSD running the OS the 8gb RAM is already good enough for all I’m asking. I understand how taking apart and upgrading the machine works but is it difficult on the software side? I’ve never had a Mac with 2 hard drives. How do I ensure that the OS gets installed and runs off the the SSD instead of the 1TB? Also is it difficult to turn this thing into a file server and Plex media host?,0.068,0.871,0.061,-0.4956,-1,0

1,goxot5,mac,6,2020/05/23 19:12:36,Evening,My MacBook Air is running poorly and I have absolutely no clue why. A couple of days ago my MacBook started acting strangely. It has a much harder time running applications that worked fine before Minecraft Chrome Photoshop etc. and I have no clue why. I haven't installed anything that could be a virus malware or anything of the sort and I did a virus scan of my computer and it came back fine. I'm fairly certain that it isn't because my hard drive is running out of space as it's run fine with only a GB or two of space left and I have 32.25 GB of free space. I don't think it's a problem with RAM storage although it very well might be. I tried resetting my SMC and I don't think it did anything. Nothing has changed as far as I can tell and it's really annoying having Chrome crash with 10 tabs open. I've also been having an issue where the graphics go completely whack with pop-up menus being empty windows being completely black and the like. I can simply restart my computer to fix it so it's not a large issue but it started at the same time as the slowdown so it's probably connected in some way to the problem. If you need any more information I would be happy to provide it. Thanks in advance to anyone who tries to help! NOTE My computer is a school laptop and certain functions may be blocked. Although there are very large files I have downloaded that I can't uninstall I've had them for a while so they most likely aren't the root of the problem. Even if this prevents the problem from being solved I can hopefully contact my school's IT department and have them fix it.,0.042,0.811,0.147,0.9833,1,1

1,goxf6k,mac,2,2020/05/23 18:54:13,Afternoon,Question about resource sharing on the i3 Mac Mini - Thunderbolt Ports / PCIe lanes / etc... I have a Mac Mini 2018 i3 model. But it still has 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports and seeing as that’s one of the reasons I bought it I’m trying to use them as actual TB3 ports not just USB-C. I was testing GPU rendering with a pair of GPUs in external TB3 enclosures and.... it actually works! For around an hour... then the little Mac just seems to give up the cards stop being recognized and the whole system gets glitchy. Feeling frustrated. I’m not really blaming Apple since it’s probably more down to the way the i3 has PCIe lanes routed to it rather than any design choice that Apple made but if something is advertised with 4x of something that implies that I can use them all at the same time - Does anyone know if the i7 version would perform better? I’m thinking the i7 may have more directly connected PCIe lanes while the i3 is probably reliant on data switching and lane sharing from the TB3 controller through the chipset then to the CPU. I suspect this because I observed that while plugging in the 2nd GPU while it was recognizing the new hardware the NIC dropped my network connection as though it had been briefly unplugged leading me to suspect that the I/O on the Mac Mini has very few dedicated paths to the CPU.

It all started when google chrome absolutely would not load a webpage but all of my system apps were working fine. I tried restarting many times but it would never clear the problem. Chrome would cause my system to jam up and become unusable until I force closed it. It’s been a while since I’ve reset it and the hard drive only had 40gbs free at the time so I figured I’d give that a shot. Got it back to barebones MacOS 10.13.6 and it was actually working a lot better yesterday I was thinking that may have fixed it. Started out using safari and it was loading webpages and everything just fine. But now today I’m currently trying to use it and it is so bad. Can’t even get through system settings without pinwheeling every time I click on something can’t even see activity monitor or shut the beast down in this current state. What are these signs of? Is this a possible hard drive problem? This MacBook has performed flawlessly every day for me for the last 4/5 years through heavy and light usage alike but I have taken excellent care of it. If it’s just a hard drive I would gladly take it as an excuse to upgrade to an SSD. Im not ready to give this thing up yet it still works like a dream!,0.064,0.786,0.15,0.9799,1,1

I can make purchases on Apple TV edit most of my account access my iTunes but I can't setup 2FA or log into appleid.apple.com to make manage my account. When I go to reset the questions on the iforgot apple site it says my account doesn't have enough information to do this. Since I have access to my most of my account does anyone know the information I need to enter to get the reset prompts to populate? Apple support was pretty much useless.

I read some other posts but the suggested fixes didn't seem to work and this is my only apple device. Does anyone know a way to fix this issue? Did I miss something during initial setup?

You can prevent a lot of drama and heartache through a few small actions today! Time machine makes it super easy to back up your apps settings and files. All you need is an external. Externals are cheap as hell compared to lost data. Don't worry about the speed if you can't afford a fast one- it can run overnight for as long as it needs to run. Look for double your HDD in terms of capacity. Time machine also does versioning so if you want that file as it was 6 months ago instead of today you can do that. Bootable backups are nice as well. With a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner or similar you can put an image of your HDD on an external. If your internal dies boot from your external and it's just like nothing bad ever happened. Offsite/cloud backups are also a thing. iCloud lets you store things. There are also services like Backblaze that let you back up any drive connected to your computer and download the files from the web or receive a restore drive in the mail. If your house burns down are your files safe? The monthly or annual fee on these services is trivial compared to the cost of lost data. If you have other suggestions comment below please! If you're not backed up yet get to backin'!!!!!! Order a drive on Amazon. Get Best Buy curbside pickup. Strap up and brave the local Wal Mart. Research cloud services and subscribe to one.

A friend of mine brought his iMac mid-2010 to me today with the hard drive removed with a new SSD installed in it physically. I've been dealing with Windows for over 10 years but only have been messing with Mac OS for about 2-3 years. That being said I feel like I am missing something here. I surely created the boot drive properly and installed High Sierra to a USB after I formatted the drive via cmd and installed High Sierra to the USB. I removed the SSD from the iMac and plugged it into my Macbook Pro via USB adapter and erased formatted it to GUID and whatnot. I put the SSD back into the iMac and plugged in the flash drive.

I’m using a 2015 MBP running latest macOS version. This evening I noticed some of my picture files were missing and then I had a deeper look and noticed all of my photos and many of my random files documents and images located on desktop and in various user folders had vanished. Every affected folder had the same “last modified” time stamp which was two hours previous. My first instinct was malware/ransomware. But all I was doing at the time was editing an audio file and emailing that file all using legit/uncracked software. I’m pretty careful about what software I use but obviously I can’t rule malware out 100%. Although I got no ransomware pop up window. Must be some kind of file corruption right? But it’s strange that it’s only user files but not all user files and not any system files that I can see. Also strange that it all happened at the same time which would correspond to the time I woke the Mac from sleep. The only other thing I noticed was shortly after I started using the Mac this evening a massive 90GB time machine backup started. This is unusual as it backs up regularly and usually less than 1GB per backup. I thought it was strange but just assumed it was just another time machine bug that I’ve seen over the years. I restarted my machine but that didn’t fix it. So I’m currently restoring from yesterday’s time machine backup. The file transfer seems to be very slow over cat5e 15 hours estimated for 250GB so that could indicate SSD problems?? Has anyone seen anything like this before? Is it a sign of a failing SSD?

1,gotpmx,mac,4,2020/05/23 14:53:22,Afternoon,After looking at high end windows laptops for design it was clear MBPs aren't overpriced and I am getting one. This is a hardcore windows guy who has a PC since 1997. I don't like MAC OS. Had to use it at some classes at uni a decade ago. Anyway I am looking for a laptop that will last for 5 years and is good for design. I am in Europe by the way. So I was looking online for prices of Lenovos and Dells and looking at 1TB SSD laptops with good-ish gpu great screen and top build quality and BOOM!!! 2500EUR even 3500EUR and I couldn't even find one with 1TB SSD under 3000EUR. For a freaking Dell and Lenovo? I was shocked. I remember it was always the MBP being at those price ranges. I am not going to spend 3000EUR on a laptop that isn't made by Apple if I really have to get one. It makes 0 sense even if you despise MAC OS. I am making an investment and it seems nowadays high end windows laptops are actually the worst kind of investment. I remember vividly 5-6 years ago there wasn't a single windows laptop that wasn't a better spec and price than a MBP besides high end gaming laptops . I haven't payed much attention lately to laptops and I was so surprised. I even checked god knows how many reviews and a 3500EUR XPS 15 had worse performance than a 2800EUR MBP when it comes to video editing and photo editing.

I've been using a 2011 Macbook Pro for years but was just gifted a 2020 Macbook Pro for my birthday! I'm beyond excited to start using it and was looking to purchase a monitor to use alongside it. My big issue is cable management. As an amateur musician in a tiny apartment I'm already swamped with/overwhelmed by all manner of cables however because I'm making a big upgrade from an old computer all of my accessories have traditional USB 3.0 cables and I understand that might mean purchasing more cables/adapters. My friend suggested a hub to connect to my Mac... but even with a hub I would still need a power source for the hub/monitocomputer and I am running out of outlets in my room. From what I understand it would make sense for me to get a monitor that connects via USB-C and has USB 3.0 ports. It would eliminate the extra cables from a hub and the need to purchase a hub in the first place and the cables from a laptop charger. I've seen some cheaper monitors that seem to fit the bill but I believe a lot of them sacrifice resolution for price. I also heard from a friend that I might have trouble with the speed of the USB ports if I'm recording music through my audio interface/running a program like Logic Pro if my computer is siphoning a lot of power from the monitor at the same time. Is this something that I should be worried about? I've been researching for the past few days but I know very little about computer hardware and am overwhelmed by choice/computer jargon... so I've turned to Reddit. Would love to know what you've found works for you. TL DR I'm looking for a new monitor for my 2020 Macbook Pro that connects via USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 that is powerful enough to charge my computer while also allowing me to utilize the USB 3.0 ports to their fullest capacity and that doesn't skimp too hard on image resolution. I also hate cables. Any recommendations? Thanks so much for your help!,0.031,0.857,0.112,0.9839,1,1

I'm a college student with a month left in my remote learning and just started having some laptop issues. I have a MacBook pro 2017 13in touchbar model. The screen is flashing pink and blue horizontal lines on the top and has some discolored/glitching pixels on the lefthand side I included a video for reference .

I work professionally as a filmmaker and video artist and shoot 4k raw video 99% of the time with a Blackmagic camera. Generally my workflow involves heavy color and compositing work in Davinci editing in Premiere CC and more compositing and effects in Ae. That's about it for the work I do on the Mac Pro. At the moment this setup is perfect for my work and I have yet to see any slowdowns or issues with the computer. The problem is as many of you know this computer is about 10 years old now and the processors board and psu are all original. I am pondering an upgrade in the next year or so just to get a jump on things as I know this machine won't last forever. I have done extensive research on the Mac Mini 2020 maxed out everything self upgrade to max ram 1TB ssd and the MBP 16 with the maxed processor probably 1TB ssd 8GB graphics and 64GB ram . For either of these options I would have to pick up some sort of NAS or drive array to work off of and store videos. It also sounds like I need an eGPU for the Mini and maybe for the MBP too. I work away from home 25% of the time pre-covid and currently just have a shit experience using a 15 MBP from 2012. I really only do this if I absolutely have to but I do travel a lot so it would be nice to have a more capable laptop- just not a necessity. Anyway this all comes down to the question-- does anyone have experience with a similar workflow using any of these new machines I mentioned? Would any of these machines be a downgrade from my current setup? Have you previously transitioned from a cMP? Is there a better option I'm not considering? Of course the new Mac Pro is phenomenal and correct me if I'm wrong but I believe it would cost at least 8k to get something up to spec. As far as I can tell my other options would hit around 4-5k. I am not interested in building a hackintosh or transitioning to a PC I have tried both in the past and it's just not on the table this time around.

It was my first mac and so far only and I've owned it from new. It has never let me down and has been a workhorse. I use it for everything work pleasure video editing with FCP music with Logic you name it.

I just replaced the battery for the first time a few months ago. I'm still on Mojave as I'm waiting for compatibility issues with Catalina and some third party audio software to be sorted but I'm in no rush on that. My questions are How much longer could I feasibly get out of the old girl? Have I done as much as possible to squeeze some more life out of it? If not what have I missed?

1,gok2p6,mac,3,2020/05/23 06:12:27,Night,mac I need your help! I'm considering buying my first Mac and wondering if the MacBook Air 2020 is a worthy investment. I live in India and I'm considering buying the MacBook Air 2020 model. Currently I'm using a Dell Inspiron with Linux on it specifically elementary OS and I hate Windows. This would be my first Mac experience so bear that in mind maybe. Needs My most important needs are Extensive browsing and typing lots of quick photo editing I'm a writer Portability and really good battery life I want at least 9 hours which most laptops fail to give Smart file manager like elementary OS - I want my file manger to have multiple tabs quick file previews some sort of memory feature where it can remember last open folders easy integration with apps/actions e.g. right click on an image resize convert etc. .- Oh also can I connect my Android phone to the Mac and manage files easily? I know it sounds like a stupid question but I've heard people complain about this. Light video and audio editing how is iMovie and Garageband for people new to video and podcast creation? Can you guys tell me if and how specifically does macOS meet these needs? Which model? The second thing I need help with is choosing the right model the MacBook Air 2020 sells in India for i3 dual-core with 256 GB storage for ₹93k. 1230 i5 quad-core with 512 GB storage for ₹123k 1630 I'm hesitant to get the i5 model because ₹100k is hitting my budget but every review I read suggests strongly going for the i5 model for much better performance. I intend to use this laptop for at least 4 years if not more so I have a feeling that while the i3 maybe fine for now it will show its age quickly in a couple of years. Do you think I can do with i3? What I don't want? I've looked into older MacBook Air models I don't want to risk the Butterfly keyboard just to get a lower price. I've also looked into getting an iPad Pro with a keyboard but have ruled it out for various reasons including like its mediocre file management. Dell XPS vs. MBA 2020 If the Mac doesn't meet my needs I may buy a Dell XPS with Linux instead but from what I've heard I'm hoping that macOS will give me a productivity boost.

I’ve cycled through several PCs and Windows laptops but the compatibility and overall ecosystem of macOS has been especially tempting in the recent years. I’m currently using a Lenovo ThinkPad L480 i5 processor 16 gigs of RAM with an upgraded 1TB SSD after some tinkering . It’s a decent laptop but the build quality doesn’t echo the original ThinkPads and I can see myself buying a new laptop sometime next year. Recent Windows updates have made me further consider jumping ship. Question is would switching to a Mac be worth it by next year? Besides compatibility and general UI features I want to know the pros and cons of using a Mac hardware and software . Factors to consider would be price storage ideally 1TB 512GB would be pushing it processor and hardware considerations definitely want to avoid the butterfly keyboard . I’m not too heavy a user—at the most I have Photoshop Illustrator or Audition running. Feedback and thoughts would be appreciated.

I have a broken MBP 2015 which the costs of repair are considerably higher than getting a new one so I thought this would be a good opportunity to jump to the next generation. I have already considered the USB-C and other feature-related issues but I'm worried about manufacturing issues. I was about to buy a 2016 13 without touchbar in perfect state with new keyboard and battery replaced by Apple but then pulled out because of worries about flexgate/stagelight and keyboard issues. Searching online it seemed to me that if you have a 2016-2017 you're condemned to at least get flexgate at some point but is it that widespread? That's the only thing preventing me from upgrading if not I'll have to settle for a 2014 model because I'm having a hard time finding any reasonably priced 2015 here. I really want to get a newer one but also don't want to wake up one day to find the screen dead all of a sudden. Thank you!,0.149,0.792,0.059,-0.9572,-1,0

4,gobaov,mac,9,2020/05/22 19:02:12,Evening,Performance of macbook air 2020 was not what I expected should I exchange it for another laptop? Hi! I recently bought the Macbook Air 2020 intel core 5 w/ 256 GB . I bought it because I'm going to grad school soon and I heard it was a good laptop for those who just use their computers for everyday tasks nothing too crazy in terms of processing . Within a week of use I noticed the fan is incredibly loud and my laptop heats up all the time. This is a daily thing and the only thing I use is google chrome. I know I should switch to safari but its ridiculous that my laptop will heat up and the fan goes off even with one tab open playing tetris or if I join a google hangout. Another issue I have with this laptop is the rainbow wheel of death that appears when i click on certain apps like facetime and photos. I find it strange that it takes a long time to open apple's own apps. Lastly the battery life kinda sucks? I find myself having to recharge my laptop at least once a day and I literally just got this a week ago. I've never had these issue with my early 2015 macbook. I would have continued to use it if it didn't become so slow. I contacted apple and they suggested i send it to the apple care team so they can see if there's a manufacturing issue but I also wanted reddit's advice to see if this is a common occurrence. If it is I'm debating what laptop I should get instead.,0.051,0.86,0.089,0.8079,1,1

Basically after only installing three games I'm at the windows limit. Been looking at hard drives and it is certainly more efficient for me to get one 4TB than 2 2TB. Is it doable to partition an external drive into these two different formats and have a 4TB where 2 TB of space is recognized each in Mac OS and Windows?

1,goa6em,mac,4,2020/05/22 17:47:08,Afternoon,Resetting a LOT of T2-Equipped Macs AppleEnterprise is a bit dead else I would ask there. MDM Mobile Device Management software used to set policies for student devices that needs to be installed as a part of setting up the device for the first time to configure the devices correctly. x200B I find myself needing to do a full reinstall of MacOS on 300 yes three hundred new MacBook Air 2019s. I work for a school and I'm setting up devices are for students next autumn. There is a bug in Setup Assistant MDM enrollment on the version of MacOS the devices shipped with. I don't want to post too many details publicly out of respect for the my employer and the MDM provider who has been lovely throughout this whole process... Long story short devices fail to enroll and the only known solution confirmed by the MDM provider who is actively working on this with Apple is a full OS reinstall. OS reinstall time I boot into recovery mode into Disk Utility wipe the disk create a new partition and then go into Install MacOS agree to the terms choose the partition and wait. Recovery attempts to download MacOS. Recovery fails after 20-40 minutes about 75% of the time across every single device with PKDownloader Error 8. So I made a few Catalina install USBs to take the network out of the equation. These Macs have the T2 chip so they won't boot from USB by default. I reboot into recovery and open Startup Security Utility. It needs an admin to authenticate. This is a new device straight out of the box there are no admins. Startup Security Utility refuses to launch. On a new machine one where I haven't wiped the disk I boot up the device fails to enroll in MDM but lets me continue as if it is a consumer device I go through setup and create a temporary admin account reboot into recovery enable boot from USB authenticating with my new temp account reboot into the USB connect to the internet to update something or other since this is a newer version of MacOS than the device has seen before reboot into the USB but for real this time wipe drives install MacOS and everything goes swimmingly from there. This process works but takes FOREVER and sometimes steps fail along the way and need to be restarted.

The place I bought it from said they got the battery replaced by Apple only a few months ago and I believe that since the cycles are only at 109 and my battery program says it's 10 months old. But I thought this thing was supposed to get around 9 hours or so of battery. I'm so far doing basic web browsing on Safari and Spotify streaming and I really get around 4 - 5. Is my battery defective? Should I take it in? All help appreciated.,0.026,0.84,0.134,0.9176,1,1

I opted for an older model with a disk drive so I could play DVDs in it. Lately it’s been crashing every so often. Once it froze and had to be rebooted from a Zoom meeting and took forever to reload. That was maybe a month back. Same when I was writing a paper on Microsoft Word about a week ago. It shut down and took like 35 minutes to get back up to normal speed once reopened. Last night when trying to save an article I had on a website as a PDF. Froze. Crashed and rebooted itself. Super slow to get back up to speed. Is there something I should be doing? It’s been buggy and extra slow since updating to MacOS Catalina about three-four months ago but nothing like this. It runs normally a lot of the time but just this past week it’s crashed twice in the middle of totally normal tasks. Does it need to be powered down more often? Maybe a program needs to be deleted? I downloaded creative cloud but it runs super slow anyways and my trial is up so maybe delete that?,0.0,0.897,0.103,0.9663,1,1

The SSD is the drive that automatically boots up it has Mac OS installed and is the main drive. The second hard drive though says it’s used not even a full GB it has no software installed nothing. I have ran out of space on my SSD and want to install Mac OS on the HD and make it my primary drive that boots up once the computer has been turned on. How do I do this?

I'm 99% of the time a PC guy but I have an old macbook my girlfriend uses from time to time. Today I received an email/call from my ISP saying that a device in my house connected to my network had some kind of security issue. I found this pretty hard to believe as I'm pretty secure when it comes to all my online devices. It's also not a scam. My ISP confirmed it but they were pretty limited in giving me details. They provided me with an IP address which none of the devices in my house correspond to as well as some host information which was bgtc.mac-autofixer.com Upon reading up online I found that Mac autofixer is some kind of malicious software that tries to scam you etc. Easy enough fix except that when i search through the applications folder on the macbook I have no evidence that mac auto fixer is even installed. I figured I could install some kind of Mac anti malware program but I am met with the issue that this Macbook OS is too old to install software of any kind.

Right now I'm looking at either a suped-up i7 13 MacBook Pro with 1TB 32GB RAM or a mid-level 16 MacBook Pro with similar specs. My workload is decently light however I would like to get into virtualization tech and possibly make a virtual homelab setup with the MacBook that I choose. Do you think the 13 MacBook Pro with its 10th gen Intel i7 will suffice? Ideally I want the computer to last me a long while another 5-10 years would be great. I want the computer to be portable as well as I am tired of carrying around a heavier computer. In a perfect world the 13 would have a bit more oomph and a discrete GPU but oh well ツ / ,0.013,0.847,0.14,0.9238,1,1

I've had my new 13” MacBook Pro 2020 base model 16GB for about a week and I've loved it so far however I've realised that there is an issue when listening to audio through headphones. Whenever the audio stops starts or is scrubbed through there is an audible clicking or popping that sounds a bit like when you plug headphones into an audio jack. I'm not getting the same noise through the speakers as far as I can tell and when I listen via a 3.5mm to USB-C adapter it is absent on the headphones too. So it seems restricted to the headphone port I've tried different headphones too and the same problem persists . Is anyone else experiencing this? Is this something that could be fixed in a software update? I really don't want to have to return it... --------- Upon a bit more experimentation it appears to be a power management issue. If any other audio is playing even when the volume is at zero then the popping does not occur. So it appears OSX is turning the audio jack on and off as soon as audio starts and stops causing the popping. So a quick fix is to have an ambient audio source playing with the volume at zero. I'm personally using Noizio off the App Store as it sits unobtrusively in the menu bar but I'm pretty sure anything would work. I really hope apple fix this as it has taken the edge off of an otherwise fantastic product... Apparently there is a similar issue with Realtek HD Audio drivers on Dell PCs too although there you have to wait 10-20 seconds before the jack will shut off . They recommend replacing the drivers but obviously it's not quite as easy to replace core audio on a Mac! ,0.034,0.88,0.085,0.9611,1,1

So I backed up my computer 3 days ago on time machine when I had High Sierra and then proceeded to upgrade to Catalina. For whatever reason the system does not run well on my mac and i'd like to revert my computer back however when trying to use time machine I get this message 'The system cannot be restored onto this disk because HFS systems can't be restored to space sharing APFS volumes. Reinstall MacOS on this disk and then use Migration Assistant to transfer data from your backup assistant.' I was advised to try in internet recovery mode but when trying to select my computers drive I am forever stuck on 'searching for disks...' so this isn't an option either it seems. So I'm thinking that if I factory reset my computer I can then use my time machine to bring it back to how it was pre Catalina. Does this sound right? I just want to double check before I wipe my computer if theres a possibility time machine won't work I figure the message about the system being unable to be restored is because of Catalina but a factory reset should get rid of Catalina right? Any help would be appreciated as I need my laptop working asap and its driving me a bit mad now thanks!,0.063,0.85,0.087,0.7738,1,1

But that card R9 270 i think is windows only so I basically never use it since this mac pro is booted into MacOS 99% of the time. I was looking at what PCI options there are and what I hear suggested is that there are a whole array of AMD PCI cards that now have supported built in from the OS. You don't even need Mac versions?! Is this true? If so is there a list somewhere? And details of what is supported and what is it? I think I read that the unflashed card would have no pre-boot video. But that's fine since I'd be keeping the original nvidia card. My Mac Pro is currently on High Sierra and it probably will be for some time to come. I might upgrade it to Mojave at some point. High Sierra support is the most important thing at this point. Ideally I'd like a pretty powerful card for no more than 150. Which leads me to the next question. Assume I get a list of supported cards how do you actually compare their performance to know which ones have good computing bang for the buck and which do not? Trying to compare GPU performance is like trying to compare cable bills. It's all just a random jumble of market speak that you purposefully can't make any sense of.,0.02,0.798,0.181,0.9923,1,1

4,gnm2db,mac,3,2020/05/21 15:56:44,Afternoon,Need a new Mac! So here’s my pickle - I picked up a couple of laptops in the past few weeks since I’m not sure which will handle my workload better 1 . MacBook Pro 16” 2019 base model 2.6GHz i7 16GB DDR4 512GB SSD Pros can run all sorts of apps concurrently with no slowdown screen size is real nice Cons the battery life has been awful so far I’m 10 cycles in and can see it draining at least 1% every minute the trackpad is comically large I’m always hitting it by accident it’s unwieldy carrying it from room to room is a hassle and I can’t see over the screen when I’m on my couch first world problems 2 . MacBook Air 2020 base model 1.1GHz i3 8GB LPDDR4X 256GB SSD Pros easy to move around the house and throw in a bag battery life is much better than the Pro I have a bunch of chargers that will support it Cons workflow has to be modified to accommodate the reduced horsepower smaller screen obviously This is where I need your expert advice and collective experience. I think the new MBA is the way to go but with an upgraded i5 CPU this is a 100 investment that should yield the best bang for the buck. I don’t need the 512GB SSD so I’m hesitant to get the higher end model but I was wondering if it’s worth springing for the 200 RAM upgrade to 16GB? This would be way more useful than the disk space IMO. The programs I usually have running are Safari Chrome VPN Client VSCode iTerm 2 Messages Discord MS Teams MS Remote Desktop With the exception of Chrome none of these is too taxing. I just want to hear from folks who have had experience with a similar setup and workflow. Edit Wow I seem to have incensed some 16 loyalists. I'm not trying to pick a fight with anyone so try not to infer anything negative from my tone I'm pretty loyal to Apple but there have been some severe missteps in many of their recent product lines. I still don't understand the need for the Touch Bar. Having said that I also have some 10 years or so as a professional Mac user and supporter.

If you use BootCamp or different boot drives the chance for issues goes way up. This little tip has saved my butt many many times in the 13 years Ive been using OS X / MacOS. I picked this up when I worked for Apple back in the early 2000s and have kept one on hand ever since. I buy a small 60-120GB external SSD or USB drive and partition it into two. On one partition I install a bootable version of whichever MacOS version my main system is running. This will allow me to boot into the external drive and assess the internal drive that may have failed and troubleshoot the system. On the second partition I create a bootable MacOS installer that allows me to reinstall MacOS in the event the internal recovery partition is corrupt. Apple Support article on creating external MacOS installer This practice saved me again this week when I had an old SSD boot drive go belly-up. I was able to use my external tool kit to troubleshoot and the installer to format and install MacOS on the replacement boot drive much quicker than internet recovery mode. Restored from my Time Machine Backup and was up in running in under 2 hours. If you are far from an Apple Store and rely heavily on your Mac it might be worth the small amount of time and money to make an bootable external drive to help cut your downtime. Another great practice is to keep a bootable clone of your main drive using a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner x200B Just my ramblings hope it saves someone some headaches in the future.,0.051,0.82,0.129,0.9678,1,1

The only concern I have is about its performance which should be enough for me as I don't do anything particularly processor intensive day-to-day. I tend to have pretty intensive internet browsing sessions regularly though which imply having 100 tabs open at the same time. Should the Air handle this?

I have wanted an Apple Monitor since the Thunderbolt Display was discontinued in 2016. When I heard the news of Apple making a monitor back in 2017 I was so happy! I expected to pay around 2500 for the rumored 32inch 6K display. When it finally came out bam 5000 so i canned that idea. Now I have an opportunity to buy an XDR for about 30% off which drops the price to around 3500. I can also sell my LG 5k for about 800 which brings my cost down to being around what I was originally thinking of spending on an Apple Monitor. My use case is mostly software/hardware development but I also am a hobbiest photographer and do a little bit of video work.

I've got a very strange issue which many days trawling Google just hasn't been able to solve. I have a Rode Videomicro with an SC7 cable TRS - TRRS which I use with my iPhone to record audio outside. It works well and I've had no issues with it in this regard. However when I plug it into a 15 2017 MBP through the 3.5mm port it doesn't show up in the sound preferences panel to use as an external microphone. I tried on my girlfriend's 15 2018 MBP - which I assume uses exactly the same sound system - and it popped up straight away and works like a charm. Oddly my pair of Bose QC25's shows up as a valid external microphone just fine when plugged in with the cable. My question is... what gives? Does the 2017 MBP actually have a slightly different microphone input which doesn't like higher impedance microphones for some reason? And if so... how can I get this darn microphone to show up on my laptop without buying an audio interface... I've tried rebooting many times. I've tried using a different cable.

However I'm undecided and not sufficiently knowledgeable to decide which model or specifications I should buy/add. The entry level comes with these specs Has 1 fan x200B Entry Model While the updated model has these Has 2 fans x200B Intermediate Model This is my first time ever going into MacOS. I've always used Windows but lately my friends and coworkers have changed my perspective on Macbooks. The intermediate value is 500 bucks more expensive than the entry model and although I do have the money to purchase it i'd like the best cost-benefit choice. The things i'll be most likely to use the macbook for are to code in Android Studio try out Xcode and mostly mobile development. If the entry model is more than enough to handle mobile development should I add some upgrades or do you recommend otherwise. Note that I'd like this macbook to last for as long as possible so if the intermediate model can outlast the entry one by a lot i'd say that's a lot of value in those extra bucks. x200B Will be much appreciated for some constructive opinions and thank you in advance From a fellow soon to be mac user.,0.006,0.843,0.151,0.9888,1,1

UPDATE After fussing around with my privacy and security settings I ended up deleting both Logi options and Logi options daemon from the input monitoring and accessibility panes and relaunched the app. It asked for my permission again and all is now working as expected.

I'll be using it with my 27 Thunderbolt Display and TB3 to TB2 adapter until I get a CalDigit TS3 Plus. CalDigit says you can daisy chain 2 Thunderbolt Displays from the dock. This got me thinking since you can run up to 4 4K monitors from a 16 MBP is anyone running or has seen a setup running 4 Thunderbolt Displays with a 16 MBP? I know you'd have to daisy chain 2 Displays per bus. Would be kinda cool.,0.0,0.98,0.02,0.2516,1,1

I'm looking into buying a computer for music production I currently have a 2015 Macbook Pro which is dying on me rapidly and I am heavily considering buying a refurbished Mac Pro 5 1 with all the the specs near maxed out because it would be a powerful computer within my price range less than 2700 hopefully The computer I am buying would have 3.46 12-core XeonX5690 128GB Ram 1TB SSD 8GB XFX Radeon RX 580 GPU Are there any major downsides to doing this? Is there some sort of unexpected hiccup I am not seeing? I know the last supported OS is Mojave but I feel like I could perhaps last a few years on that.

Ripping a movie and listening to iTunes and it just shut down and will not power back up. Before that happened I was planning to max out the RAM and was considering replacing the HD with a SSD. If I’m going to have to replace the power supply anyway I’m definitely going to replace the drive. So 2 questions I guess is it worth it to do all this based on the unit’s age?

That's fine... but once my machine starts to use swap I can feel the difference. It really starts to crawl. My entire development environment just struggles. Now I noticed through some other memory monitors that my mac actually has a good amount of memory going into inactive memory. Like 25GB of inactive but it still goes to swap. I thought ohh there must be a way to force a clear of inactive memory and apparently that's possible by using the purge command. I saw that this cleared about 5GB of inactive memory! Not bad! I was curious why it couldn't clear all 25GB though and I stumbled upon and now it actually somehow cleared all 25GB.

Ok so let's preface this with a little bit of info I am currently using a 2019 13 MacBook Pro running Catalina 10.15.4. According to what both the menu bar and the settings window show I am connected to my network the network my apartment complex provides . My device is registered with the ISP via the MAC address and the status on their website says that my computer is connected. However I am unable to connect to the internet despite this. This has been the situation for several hours now. At first I assumed there must be some sort of maintenance happening but my roommates have all had connection throughout the day. I am posting this from my desktop which has also maintained connection. It seems to just be my MacBook. On top of that the connectivity issues only started around noon. I'm not sure if this is relevant or not but I thought it was weird that it happened so I might as well mention it to see if it means anything. Earlier today around the same time the internet stopped working my trackpad also stopped working properly. It would register clicks but it would not move the cursor. Shortly after a bluetooth window would open up asking about registering a keyboard but not finding one. The window eventually closed and that's when I would regain control of my cursor. This has happened a total of 3 times since the internet went out. I ran a diagnostic on my Wi-Fi environment as recommended by the apple support site but the only result was to check the DNS Resolution. Is my issue a virus? Is it a hardware issue?

So I use a lot of space on my windows partition 50/50 split from windows to Mac mostly because of games. I need to add more space to my windows partition using a program that I use frequently but I’m a bit worried on adding more space to the windows partition since I need to lose space from the Mac partition which is my main OS and the free space for my Mac partition is getting slim around 15gb free only This is why I might either install or transfer my windows installation into a usb flash drive to delete windows from my system and instead use windows by running it using a flash drive by plugging it into my Mac effectively ADDING space for the windows OS instead of parting it with the space already implemented with the Mac. Would this be possible installing windows into a flash drive keeping ALL windows files inside it so that windows just runs on the flash drive and you do not need to download the files into my system every time I use it? Also if this is possible would the speed of programs such as video games slow down or lag due to it being on a flash drive instead of being downloaded into my Mac?

So I'm in the market for either a MacBook Pro or 4k iMac. The base13 inch MacBook Pro has a 1.4 quad core 8th gen i5 and turbo boosts up to 3.9. The base 4k iMac has a 3.6 quad core 8th gen i3. This is where I get lost. So after some time on google it looks like the difference between the i3 and i5 is that an i5 or up will have turbo boost while the i3 doesn't. Therefore the i3 will have a higher clock speed because it doesn't have the variance that the i5 has. From a numbers perspective the i5 is faster when it does hit that 3.9 turbo boost. Now my question is there going to be a noticeable difference in overall computer performance or are these more similar than different? Just for background so I'm currently a PhD student with some hobbies. That makes my computer usage mostly typing papers running some stats basic to SEM usually using SPSS and/or Mplus. I don't plan on doing hardcore SEM on this computer. Moreso I'd let it run a model overnight if need be and some light video/audio editing using Adobe Premiere .,0.023,0.919,0.058,0.8363,1,1

My neighbor has a MacBook Air that she was having problems with so I offered to take a look at it and get it upgraded to the latest OS. The only files she needed off the Mac were her photos which were saved in the Photos app. In total she had about 7 500 photos in the photos app. I exported the pictures from the photos app to a USB drive. I wiped the hard drive reinstalled the OS and then upgraded the OS. Originally I did not realize that she was using the iCloud to store all her pictures. Through a combination of errors on my part trying to import the photos I exported etc. I am now seeing over 17 000 pictures in the iCloud. I am assuming that many of the images got duplicated at least once when I was trying to import the photos that I exported. What is the best way to go about cleaning up all of the duplicates? Doing this 100% manually is really not an option. I am tempted to download all the images to an external drive and then deleting everything from iCloud. I'd then hook that external drive up to my Windows machine and running the pictures through an application to detect and remove all the duplicates. Once all duplicates have been removed I'll then import them back into the Photos app and let it syn with iCloud. What are your thoughts?,0.034,0.927,0.039,0.5204,1,1

However going forward I’m going to start working in photoshop pretty heavily using large photographs as well as a tablet and stylus for hand drawing etc for coming up with promotional materials as well as possibly some video editing stuff for YouTube I’d imagine and sound editing podcasts . With that in mind I’m looking to get an iMac which I think would be the best choice given my budget iMac Pros and above are a little out of my price range and likely overpowered for what I need anyway . I think the 27 inch is the sensible option but know some upgrades to the base model will be needed/sensible. I know RAM is important but have heard you can upgrade this much cheaper on your own and looking around I can see that I could do it for about 350 I’m in the U.K. for 64GB as opposed to 1000 through Apple’s website. Seems like a no brained to order the base spec in this regard then upgrade the RAM myself. But form there what are the most important elements? Graphics card SSD processor? Or all three? Ideally I’d like to keep the budget to 3000 - 3500 with the extra RAM to follow later. So what area should I concentrate on? Feeing a little lost with it all. Also considering the outlay I want to make sure I’m future proofed as much as feasibly so the machines lasts as long as possible.

So a little while ago I was a little hasty in closing up my MBP I pulled out the headphone cable and shut my screen not realising that my headphone jack had moved between the screen and keyboard. when I shut the lid I heard a crunch sound opened up the lid as saw a crack down the right hand side of the screen and along the bottom. I had only lost about 15mm along the bottom and right hand side so I plugged it into a second monitor and continued to use it. Then whilst using it one day the main screen just died so only the external display plugged in worked. I tried to find out how much it would cost to repair but they all said I'd be better off buying a new computer. No worries I just have a desktop now instead of a laptop I'm not going anywhere in lockdown so I'm ok with that right now. Then somehow overnight the power cable came unplugged and I came down in the morning to an unresponsive laptop. I plugged in the cable back in no sound like usual when it connects. I left it charging for a bit the tried to start it up. I can see that the screen is backlit but now nothing shows up on the second monitor and the instructions to use the fingerprint log in don't show up either just an escape button. x200B I've tried resetting the NVRAM and the SMC but I'm not sure if I'm doing anything as I can't see the screen and I'm not getting any different results. I also tried starting it in safe mode to see if it would get the second monitor working so I could at least get my data off but no luck. Does anyone have an suggestions on how I might be able to get it working again? Or do I just have a nice expensive brick now? Any help is very much appreciated!!,0.052,0.841,0.107,0.9693,1,1

1,gmiub8,mac,2,2020/05/19 22:00:04,Evening,Retina MacBook Pro vs Mac Pro Need help on upgrading from 2012 rMBP Hello all I am currently in the market to upgrade my 2.6ghz 16gb i7 2012 rMBP. I use my Mac for video processing converting and editing. Nothing too crazy but high quality 1080p video trimming and light editing as well as some 4k exporting. My current rMBP is pretty excellent and still runs rather fast but it seems that the 650M are no longer fitting my needs it lacks TB2 not a dealbreaker but would be nice and the 512 ssd is not enough for me. I see myself with 3 options stick with this computer and upgrade the ssd upgrade to a newer rMBP or look at a desktop. I believe I would benefit most from an upgrade to another machine since the 2012 ssd are a little pricey. I am looking at the mid 2015 rMBP with 2.8ghz 16gb ram 2tb ssd and M370x or a 2012 Mac Pro with 3.46ghz x5690 23/32gb ram 500gb ssd and 2 2tb hdd and 8gb radeon rx 580 gpu. I have found both for about the same price. Im wondering what would be the best option for me? Apple dropped support for the Mac Pro so it won't be seeing Catalina or other future OSs but I feel as if the 2015 rMBP is on its way out soon as well. What I'm asking is how much improvement will I see going with the MacBook vs Mac Pro. The MBP has usb 3 bigger ssd than I currently have tb2 force touch dedicated gpu and a bump in processor speed from my current model. The Mac Pro has a bunch of options for storage up to 6 drives that I can raid to probably be faster than the MBP 8gb graphics 12 cores 3.46ghz and 24 or 32gb of ram depending on what I would decide on. Will the processor bump and dedicated gpu of the 2015 rMBP see much improvement over my current 2012 rMBP is it even worth it ? Will the Mac Pros older but faster desktop hardware be better than this? What would be the best machine as in the fastest and most powerful? What would you recommend either for me or if you had to choose? I currently use my rMBP docked to my Thunderbolt Display and another monitor about 50% of the time. The mobility of this set up is nice I'm thinking I can keep my laptop and add a desktop into the mix if that would be the best route if not I would go with the newer laptop and use my old one as a desktop always plugged into the TB display.,0.006,0.828,0.167,0.9978,1,1

1,gm7imv,mac,0,2020/05/19 10:49:32,Morning,Think a Magic Keyboard v3 with touchbatouch id is a possibility? I know people have their differences with the touchbar but when set up right it can definitely be nice for certain functions and touch id is extremely nice as i dont think anyone would disagree. That said when im working at my desk its something thats missing as I dont really want to pivot to the MBP keyboard to look at/use touch bar. Do you guys think that eventually Apple will integrate the touchbar into their keyboards or is that something that will stick only with the MBPs and is a pipe dream?,0.069,0.787,0.144,0.8625,1,1

I can’t get passed the screen where I am creating my a password for my profile. Is there a way to turn on Bluetooth pairing during the initial setup?

1,gm6ouc,mac,6,2020/05/19 10:07:02,Morning,2020 13” MacBook Pro vs. 2017 15” MacBook Pro So I have a mid-2017 MacBook Pro 13 inch entry level 2 port no touchbar 128gb storage 8gb ram and I’m going to sell it to my sister for 700. Because of this I’m now in the market for another MacBook Pro. Since I’m a university student I’m looking at the new 2020 13 inch MBP with the student discount. For 500 out of pocket and 1 200 total I’d be getting 256 GB storage the new keyboard tech as well as the touchbar and Touch ID. Beyond that the update is not that big. However I’ve found a secondhand mid-2017 15 inch MacBook Pro for 1 200 that is in amazing condition. This is substantial compared to the 13 inch in the sense that it will have a better processor higher RAM along with the 256gb storage and the obvious size/dedicated graphics update. As aforementioned I am a student and primarily use my computer for my work word PowerPoint excel SPSS but I also stream sports/entertainment heavily and use photoshop for designing. Because of this I have a tendency to multitask. I’m neurotic about keeping my computer clean so I’ve never had an issue with the butterfly keyboard that many people have experienced and I’ve had my 2017 since 2018. I would like an updated keyboard but I care for my tech enough to have not had any issues after 2 years with my 2017. Essentially I’m torn between getting a new 13 inch or a secondhand 15 inch. I was hoping for some input on what you guys would do in this situation. Although I love the larger 15 inch model and it’s a more substantial update I do value having something more “current” and especially straight out of the box. Let me know what you guys think in the comments thanks - ,0.022,0.852,0.126,0.9852,1,1
1,gm6m3g,mac,2,2020/05/19 10:03:21,Morning,Base model of the 2020 MacBook Pro 13 worth it? Now this has been a though decision. I have been looking at laptops non-stop for the past weeks because I'm in need of a new laptop. I was initially going to get a Windows but have now decided to get my first Mac. I'm indecisive between the 2020 MacBook Air and the mentioned MacBook Pro. The reason why I lean more towards the Pro is because of the issue with heat on the Air even though it has the newer 10th gen i5 and DDR4 and how the Pro has more power. With the Pro I would be able to get the base model and the older CPU and RAM make me uncertain on how long the laptop would last before it becomes slower etc. Any times would be useful.,0.038,0.924,0.038,0.0,0,0

1,gm662u,mac,8,2020/05/19 09:41:36,Morning,What is happening to my MacBook? I have a 13” 2015 MacBook Pro that had been working flawlessly until one week before quarantine now two months . When I turn it on trackpad doesn’t move the pointer but it does give that haptic feedback with deep pressure and the key oars won’t work except for the turn/off key and all its related combinations. Overtime I found out that if I press harder on the trackpad and at the bottom part of the Mac but at the same “location” as the trackpad the pointer eventually starts to move and keyboard works normally. However when this happens also the following fails haptic feedback stops working and for some reason If I want to caps lock the grin light indicating it’s on doesn’t always light on and always causes the Mac to freeze for about 3 or 4 seconds when I turn it off the freezing doesn’t happen. Because of quarantine I haven’t had the chance to fix it and have been doing the pressing thing but sometimes it just doesn’t work and makes me very frustrated. If I use a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard both work but the Mac’s won’t. Any idea of what is happening and if I can fix it myself?,0.072,0.877,0.051,-0.7649,-1,0

I'm not sure if I should get the 2020 Air or 2020 Pro. What is the difference between the i5 in the Air and the i5 in the Pro? Does jumping from 8th-gen Intel to 10th-gen make a big difference? The most intense thing I'll be doing is probably oldeless intense games like CSGO gmod and Stardew. I currently have a dual-core 6th-gen i7 2.6ghz. The processors on Macs seem to have much lower ghz values- will I notice slower performance because of this or are Macs just more efficient at using processor speed?

1,gm3so3,mac,7,2020/05/19 07:41:02,Morning,Thinking about going back to a MacBook Pro About 6 months I purchased a 27in iMac after owning a 13in MacBook Retina from 2014. I have really enjoyed working with the iMac but I miss the portability. I use it for photography and school work primarily. I called Apple to hypothetically talk about trading it in for some credit and purchasing a maxed RAM 16in MacBook Pro. I guess they see there is nothing for the computer to be traded up to since it is the latest iMac. I thought about third-party selling but I am looking for some advice. Is the 16in MacBook with the i7 that good? Have some of you guys enjoyed to laptop experience with external monitors?,0.016,0.861,0.124,0.9312,1,1

The graphics card is a NVIDIA Geforce 8800 GT 512 MB. I have an crappy old Screen attached and today I tried to attach my Samsung 4K TV. It works when switching it from standard to 1080p which would be totally fine for me. The problem appears when I detach the crappy screen so I would just stay on the TV. MacOS immediately switches the resolution to something else and the Screen turns black. TV shows resolution not supported . This drives me crazy because it works when I attach the crappy old on again then also the TV shows up again on 1080p. Is there any known solution for this? I already tried resetting PRAM SMC reset and I am close to a blank reinstall but I guess this wont solve my problem. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance Chris,0.111,0.781,0.109,0.39,1,1

I'll do python research small machine learning stuff with my laptop. Specifically I'm working in the field of Natural Language Processing. Considering the price the base version of MacBook air configured with quad-core and 16GB ram is the best for me. I don't care about the size of SSD 256GB is enough for me . However I'm worried about throttling will occur on the Macbook Air. When I go for the MacBook Pro 13 I'll select the option with 2.0 quad-core and 16GB 512GB SSD but it costs 1799 dollars additional tax which I think is out of my budget. I know the base model of the Macbook Pro has quad cores but that processor is not the newest one which makes me hesitated to buy it. x200B I want to hear opinions when you think about it from my perspective.,0.039,0.926,0.035,-0.1441,-1,0

Setup Monitor LG 24MP88HV-S Mac 2017 MacBook Pro 128GB no touchbar Dongle NOVOO Hub USB C Multiport 5 in 1 Story I have a MacBook Pro 2017 base model and I always used it without a problem until 1 month ago I after updating to macOS Catalina 10.15.4 all the streaming services stopped working and an error shows up in each one of them saying is something about HDCP. I contacted the chat support for all the streaming services I use and they all responded with the same they have no responsibility as they only guarantee the service to work on internal screens of devices so only on native displays. If you use an external monitor or anything else to watch they have 0 responsibility as the external device can become unsupported for piracy checks as HDCP . Even watching the content on my internal Mac display wouldn't work the only solution to this was watching on the Mac display while disconnecting everything else. Here I thought the problem was my monitor as the dongle alone didn't give me problems. Solution Long story short it was Safari... Call me dumb for not thinking about the browser before doing all of that but how? And why the browser should be a problem only on the monitor and not on the Mac itself? Now everything is working with Firefox. x200B Hope this will help someone and if some of you know anything about this I'm interested!,0.066,0.836,0.098,0.8931,1,1

I've saved my parents a lot of money through scholarships so I am trying to decide on an upgrade. I have had the same mac since 2013 and I've pretty much used it to bits. It's slow I can't really do any sort of gaming anymore on it and I'm just counting down the days until it explodes or something. It's recommending that I replace the battery asap. I can no longer run Final Cut Pro because every time I try the program crashes. I also edit photos using Aperture regularly but cannot export anything anymore. I figured that the new 16 inch base model would be best to last me the next decade or so. I want whichever option will last me longer before dying will be faster in running programs like Aperture and Final Cut Pro and will have a longer lasting battery. So - should I upgrade from 16 GB to 32 GB of RAM and leave everything else the same or should I upgrade my processor instead and leave everything else the same? I understand I will receive a student discount - does anyone know anything about this? According to Apple's site I can't trade in my 2013 mac for money but I can recycle it. What should I do with my beat up 2013? I figure it will last another half year before it breaks down. Has anyone made an big jump in mac versions like this before that can talk about how much different it is? Everything in my 2013 mac is all the base version without upgrades.,0.03,0.896,0.075,0.9425,1,1

1,gluke1,mac,6,2020/05/18 20:29:14,Evening,Does shutting down or force quitting when a program stops responding count as a ‘crash’? I am working in Microsoft Word and the program has stopped responding. I learnt there’s an autosave function that starts once you first save and then refreshes every 10 minutes. I feel very stupid for having not done this because I’ve been working on the document for awhile however this has never happened before so I felt safe. I read that Word has an auto recovery function however for when the application closes unexpectedly or due to a crash. However I know this is deleted if you manually select ‘don’t save when you close’. So my question is since it is not responding and I cannot close it I have two options. To force quit and to restart my computer. If I force quit word does it consider me closing it with ‘don’t save’? On the other hand if I restart my computer while it’s not responding would this be considered a ‘crash’? When I go back on Word would I be able to access the recovery files?

Hi all hope this is OK to post here - but I see other tech support style threads. I'll cut right to the chase and say I've shot myself in the foot. It's been 10 years since I really dealt with macs and even then we had boot media! In short I have a new to me macbook pro 13 and wanted to format and start fresh on the machine. I moved forward with the catalina download 10.12 was installed by the original owner and built the install media. I rebooted into recovery cleaned the disk and selected install MacOS from my installation drive. I didn't take a clone or time machine before doing this because I figured there was nothing to save. Well the install launches gets going for about 30 seconds reboots gives progress for about 3 minutes and then dies saying An error occurred while loading the installer resources. I didnt have any failures or error messages when I created the boot media so I dont think I screwed that up - but hey it's anyone's guess here. Any hints? Thanks a ton ,0.072,0.784,0.144,0.9366,1,1

I'm currently on a base model 13 retina from early 2015 and looking to make an upgrade to the new 13 4-port version. Currently I'm thinking of keeping the base CPU upgrading to 32 GB ram and upping to 1TB storage. I was initially thinking of going with just 16 GB but I'm planning on running Parallels VM for windows gaming I know bootcamp is a thing but my strong preference here is to not have to dual boot and also hooking up an eGPU down the line. I also do quite a bit of development via Xcode requiring running iOS simulators as well. Ideally I'm also looking to keep this new machine for at least another 5 years or so by which point perhaps the ARM support will be pretty good. Also if we anticipate a newebetter redesign coming in the near future 6 months or so I think I can probably hold out. Thanks in advance!,0.0,0.856,0.144,0.9811,1,1

Recently I upgraded to a SSD which brought it back to life and I am currently waiting on 16 gigs of RAM that I ordered to arrive. The weakest part of my MacBook is the battery it's status is Replace Soon and has over 1900 cycles on the battery. I can get about 2ish hours of internet browsing before I need to charge it. Personally I am trying to get another 2ish years out of this MPB before I upgrade again the most intense thing I do is record basic demos on Logic . I looked up battery costs online and they are running around 90. I'm trying to keep the cost down as it is an older machine. Could not replacing the battery cause other damage to my computer? If it does I may bite the bullet and get a new one. I always use my MPB plug it and only unplug it if I'm not using it. I also never really take it anywhere and it just sits on my desk.

And this friend of a friend shows up with his plastic trash newly bought Acer laptop. He was just showing off his benchmark scores and games etc. In passing he said no apple laptop can beat his plastic 600 laptop in scores so we did some cinenebench and geekbench runs and I dont know how his scores were like 5-10% higher. We also did a test run of tomb raider and he was getting 5-10 fps more than me. Since i was the only with apple laptop in the group I felt really embarassed with everyone taking a pass over me. I am not tech savvy at all. I thought my laptop have some issues so I thought Ill google it thats when I found this review Cranking out a mind-blowing score of 4 862 not only did the AMD-equipped Swift 3 smash its Intel twin 3 432 on our Geekbench 5.0 overall performance benchmark it also smoked the 1 799 13-inch MacBook Pro Intel Core i5-1030NG7 CPU with 16GB of RAM 4 399 .

The two displays are an Aorus CV27F and an Orion SLED2468W. The Aorus is a brand new computer monitor. However the Orion is an older TV screen. got it back in 2012 . Good reliable display all things considered onlt problem it's ever has is about 20-30 pixes of underscan. But in System Prefs. - gt Displays there's a lovly little slider I can use the drag the underscan around. Last week I finally upgraded my gaming monitor to the Aorus. I want to use the Oprion as a second display and have it Verticly next to the main Aorus. The bug I'm running into is that it can either be rotated OR underscanned but not both. When I select 270 rotation the underscan button goes to 0 and is greyed out. But when I set it back to Standard I can adjust the underscan. Even following this guide to manually change screen properties I can't get it to stick. I was able to change the values in the file to key framebuffer-rotation /key integer 80 integer // This is the key for 270 rotation key pscn /key integer 900 /integer // This is the key for underscan. 1000 is no change and it goes down from there. but when I rebot the computer the display is rotated and no underscanned. Is this a but in OS X? Or is this a compatibility thing with trying this on a really old 8 years now? display? Edit Ok so I know that this is possible. When I boot into windows I can easily use the Radeon Adrenaline software to quickly set the scaling and underscan. So... it’s just a Mac bug.,0.03,0.91,0.06,0.7677,1,1

1,glo8b4,mac,2,2020/05/18 13:51:38,Afternoon,I love my Mac. I hate my Mac. I find that for the most part cloud based services for Mac have made things a lot better and easier. However I’m a sergeant in the National Guard and need to sign some important documents for my soldiers. To keep it simple with COVID going on there’s very little help to make my personal MacBook work for me without spending money to do simple tasks. I got the 7 day free trial for adobe sign and after that it’s 15 a month! I’m normally pretty okay with just finding a work around such as printing all the documents and scanning them back in but that could happen several times if revisions need to be made. Idk this post seems really trivial because ultimately I’ll get this done I just find it funny I’ve spent the last couple hours avoiding spending an absurd amount of money on a feature I’d only use very little if I wasn’t having to do some tasks from home. I could see the value in an everyday company purchasing this service. But... i kinda miss the good old days of being able to pirate stuff that you weren’t using to continually profit off of—just apps that you needed to do one quick thing. Not that I think pirating is sustainable just way easier. And that came with risks and drawbacks too but at least back then if you did purchase something it was for good. I can’t even use microsoft word anymore because I don’t pay for it monthly. It seems like word is closer to an essential application and not a pay to use service. Also another frustration Due to the precise formatting of the evaluations we are doing there’s no simple command to make the all upper case characters turn to all lower case. I tried creating a keyboard shortcut through the “all applications” but not sure how to actually make that work. Working on a mid 2012 macbook. To conclude this post I almost wish that convenience didn’t come with the price of over complicated technical troubles. Back in the day if your pencil broke you just sharpened it. Now if you want to keep up with the pace of things you need to have some deep understanding of how a robot thinks and it’s not always logical. I love my Mac.

I just finished a month long quarantine project of completely rebuilding an early 2011 unibody MBP that was pretty much unusable for the last 5 years as all fans were constantly throttled along with CPU. This MacBook belonged to my partner who just got a 2016 MBP. Essentially I converted the computer into the highest upgrade available for this era.

Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology Handoff Funny because NOT ONE of these installs solved the fan problem. That lied in the palm rest sensor trackpad cable and a simple 40 part was the fix. The upgrades were simple the most difficult part was waiting for components to ship during a global pandemic. This thing runs as fast as my partner's 2016 MBP by the way.

Hi everybody my brothers father in law has recently recruited me to help him with him with his home IT and after sucessfully restoring a backup for him he has now entrusted me with a new quest. After being locked out of his 15 inch macbook for several weeks during a repair he now wants to buy a 11 inch macbook air as travel mac and backup machine in case his main 15-inch craps out again. ICloud is not an option due to the sheer amount of data and some severe issues in the Icloud-Outlook backup relationship. What would you suggest as ideal solution for him to have both secure backups as well as always synced data on both machines? I thought about buying a NAS to store all of his 6TB on it secured by a Raid 1 and additonal cold backups every couple months. In order to keep everything in sync I want to run nextcloud folders on both macs. So basically we have the 6tb data dump and an additional folder containing all of his current data between both macs.

For normal apps you need to check special prefer eGPU... but there is no such box in all javas which are displayed during running mc. I also checked prefer eGPU in terminal app and java launcher but in mc f3 still shows intel iris GPU and 10 fps.

Apple has refurbished 2019 quad core models for about 1050 tax included while with the education discount I can get a 2020 model for about 1300 tax included . I was dead set on getting the 2019 model and saving some money the only hesitation is the reliability of the butterfly keyboard. I’ve been on many forums and apparently the 2019 keyboard is better than previous iterations and a large majority of people who have the 2019 version haven’t experienced any problems. The only one I frequently see are that the keys sometimes get stuck when dust or crumbs get in them and blowing condensed air in it fixes the problem. I just don’t want to have to think about the possibility of the keyboard failing even though it’s still covered under the 4 year keyboard replacement warranty. So just wanted to know some of y’alls opinions. Have you experienced issues with the 2019 butterfly keyboard or with any butterfly keyboard? Would you suggest I spend the extra 250 for peace of mind that my keyboard is going to work?

It is also giving me the error message Your battery can no longer provide sufficient power to your system and needs to be replaced whenever my laptop starts up so I don't think this is a simple wear and tear issue. Furthermore I've actually had keyboard issues since I purchased the product in 2018 with some letters on the left side of my keyboard being inconsistently unresponsive. By this I mean some days all the keys work as expected but other days certain keys on the left side of the keyboard don't work unless I press them numerous times. I've tried many support tips online for fixing the keyboard issue but none have a permanent fix and with this new battery issue surfacing there must clearly be a hardware issue from bad manufacturing. I want to request support from dell but I just checked their website and my warranty has expired a year and a few months ago 25th of march 2019 so I don't I'd be applicable for any help from dell. x200B This is why I've come to you guys how should I fix these problems?,0.059,0.853,0.088,0.7717,1,1

Following the advice of this subreddit I swapped the OEM card for an Intel 9260. Swap was easy connected the antenna cables in the reverse direction as one is supposed to black to white/white to black replaced the stock drivers with Intel ones etc. The wifi connection was immediately better but the Bluetooth is miserable. Maybe 5 meters of range connection cuts out through a thin wall. If I cover the headphone with the Bluetooth receiver with my hand or turn my head away from the computer it cuts the connection. It does not disconnect the headphones though just cuts the audio which is what is confusing me. Headphones don’t disconnect until outside the range I’d expect them to last.

1,gqohly,Dell,1,2020/05/26 18:25:20,Afternoon,Dell G5 5587 Freezing/Shutting Down My Dell G5 is pretty new but is constantly freezing and shutting down. It even shut down as I was typing this post! I'm pretty unintelligent when it comes to computer hardware so I'll try my best to explain everything. I've seen some similar issues occuring for others with the G5 but none of the solutions have made sense or seemed to work for me. The laptop gets insanely hot and the fan gets pretty loud while I'm running World of Warcraft on anything but the bare minimum settings The graphic slider is a 1-10 scale. Anything above 1 puts it into overdrive . But the heat and sound isn't the biggest issue the bigger issue is that it freezes and shuts down at seemingly random times. The shut down is a bit odd the screen goes black but the laptop power light stays on and it doesn't sound like it dies. It's almost like it goes to sleep. But you can't wake it up and have to manually turn it off and back on. It's done that quite a few times while playing WoW today alone. The other issue is the freezing which feels kinda like the same problem. It just happens out of nowhere and everything continues to sound like normal but the screen is frozen in place forcing a manual reboot. I've done a diagnostics check everything was fine I believe I'm up to date on my BIOS unless there's something I'm unaware of. It seems like all my drivers are up to date. I'm really not sure what's going on. I haven't done anything funky to it so it should all be on factory stock settings. Any help would be super appreciated.,0.112,0.757,0.131,0.9277,1,1

The G5 has a 128gb ssd and 1tb hdd. The XPS has a 256gb ssd and 1tb hdd. Only thing is the G5 has a GTX 1660 Ti graphics card and the XPS has a GTX 1660 Super graphics card.

I have an idea of what I want based on the available options. There are some things I am unsure about 1. Screen I might not make 4k video right away but I want to keep this laptop around for awhile. Is the 4k screen worth the investment here? or am I just throwing money and battery life away? 2. RAM Is 16 GB enough here? or should I go for 32 GB? 3. GPU I have an option of the GTX 1650 TI or RTX 2060. The RTX has 2 GB more vram. Obviously the RTX 2060 is the better card and it won't hurt but is it overkill?

I wanted to add additional RAM so I bought a Crucial 16gb DDR4 2666. I followed Dell's manual on how to install the ram power off disconnect battery install ram reconnect and boot back up. After I closed up everything and powered back on I saw the keyboard light up and the computer running but nothing on the screen. I waited a few minutes and still nothing. When I looked closer I saw very faintly the Windows login so I tried to increase the brightness but nothing happened. I then plugged it into an external monitor and the monitor was able to display everything but the laptop was still dark. To make sure the laptop registered the ram I pulled up task manager and it recognized the computer having 24gb of ram. To make sure it wasn't the new ram doing this I powered everything off and uninstalled the new ram and then powered the laptop back on. Same thing happened dark screen. I connected dell support and they said that the motherboard would need to be replaced but my warranty would cover it. They mentioned I would need to send it in and it would take 7-10 business days to repair. What should I do? Is there a way I can fix this because I don't want to wait for it. Also is there a way to prevent this? I need the additional ram. Does the ram have to be matching like both have to be 16gb or both have to be 8gb? Dell says it can support up the 32gb.

I switched to the intel driver anyway because everyone wrote that the Nvidia is usually louder but the fan still spins up most of the time. There are stackoverflow threads for the XPS 15 but most of the solutions didn't have a proper effect on my machine. On one point I tried the things of this blog post and I installed and configured i8kmon but I didn't hear any difference until someone pointed out that I have to use dell-bios-fan-control This worked indeed! The system is much more silent now. However now I'm using this config for /etc/i8kmon.conf External program to control the fans set config i8kfan /usbin/i8kfan Report status on stdout override with --verbose option set config verbose 0 Status check timeout seconds override with --timeout option set config timeout 2 Temperature display unit C/F override with --unit option set config unit C Temperature threshold at which the temperature is displayed in red set config t high 80 Minimum expected fan speed set config min speed 2000 Temperature thresholds fan speeds low ac high ac low batt high batt These were tested on the I8000. If you have a different Dell laptop model you should check the BIOS temperature monitoring and set the appropriate thresholds here. In doubt start with low values and gradually rise them until the fans are not always on when the cpu is idle. set config 0 0 0 -1 55 -1 60 set config 1 1 1 50 65 55 70 set config 2 2 2 60 75 65 80 set config 3 2 2 70 128 75 128 Speed values are set here to avoid i8kmon probe them at every time it starts. set status leftspeed 0 1000 2000 3000 set status rightspeed 0 1000 2000 3000 end of file and it doesn't feels optimal for me.

I have also tried undervolting with ThrottleStop though I did not notice much difference TBH. Currently at -0.125mV for CPU Core and Cache and -0.55mV for Intel GPU. No changes to the NVIDIA GPU. In Dell Command Power Manager I like to have it Quiet which has me idling with all my work programs open around 53-55'C. About 52'C when set to Cool . Running a Normal 8 thread 1024M TS Bench gets the temps up to 86-88'C before hitting PL 1 throttle on the CORE and GPU with EDP OTHER on RING when set to Quiet . Even when not on Quiet the laptop can't complete these longer benchmarks without throttling it appears. Gaming performance has also increased a bit and fans are not as crazy though still cannot max out Halo Reach on Halo MCC. If it matters I am using a Dell 130W USB-C dock and the laptop is on a fanless stand that allows airflow underneath. Now I am wondering if I should still repaste the CPU and GPU before having to give back the Torx screwdriver to my friend who moves away in 6 days. My main question is is it a good idea to use the Noctua NT-H1 that came with the NH-U14S CPU cooler we put on a lab desktop build about a month ago? Will it still be good? Will there be enough? Or should I be using a different paste altogether? If I can use it and my temps will improve I'd prefer that as this paste is free and I can get it tonight rather than waiting on Amazon etc. I believe the Noctua website says unused paste is fine for 2 years from first open and would prefer having decent temps for low cost rather than unnecessarily spending for an extra degree or two cooler. Also if I am going to do the repaste should I do the thermal padding as well ? If so any recommendations on what to buy for that? Much appreciated!

This makes sense to me as the games are probably limited by the graphics with their own dedicated memory rather than the CPU I don't think that high-end CPUs go to 100% with game play .

No physical damage can be seen fell about a foot and a half onto tile but I'm getting the 7 white lights and 2 amber lights from the front display light. A bit of googling shows that it's an LCD failure. We bought this from Costco in the beginning of 2017 along with a squaretrade warranty which is typically expired.

The probability seems to vary wildly - sometimes almost all clicks register other times almost none do. If the click doesn't work additional pressure to the touchpad usually fixes the issue. The amount of extra pressure needed to be applied also seems to vary considerably from very little to a lot. Right click seems to work 100% of the time.

I have a Latitude 7400 connected via a USB 3.1 Gen 2 cable to my U3818DW monitor. This setup provided native resolution at 60Hz with power delivery to the laptop. Due to the lockdown I've not been using my office as much and when I recently tried docking I was not able to get the laptop to recognized the monitor over USB-C. I get no video and no indication that the monitor is recognizing the laptop. I do get a warning about insufficent power The PC isn't charging from Windows but nothing in device manager or in any of the event logs that I can see. What I've tried All drivers are up to date. BIOS on the laptop has been updated tried 1.6.1 1.7.3 and 1.7.4 . Monitor firmware M3B106 is current. I've tried the original OEM USB-C cable the 3.1 Gen 2 cable that was previously working AND a NEW 3.1 Gen 2 cable. I've done a complete reinstall of Windows 10. No dice. Monitor works fine on other inputs and is recognized with my desktop machine over DisplayPort and also shows up when hooked to the laptop via HDMI albiet at 30Hz refresh which is painful to use . I do not have any other devices that can output video over USB-C to test with so I can't rule out USB-C on the monitor itself although I have zero reason to suspect that it's bad .

If you've opened up your brand new Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 for me and are setting up all your peripherals get ready. apparently this is pretty common - if you can find the right threads of course Your mouse connects works and lags. Horribly. It seems to fall asleep and takes 10 seconds of shaking it to wake back up. You go to the customer service for the mouse brand because your laptop is brand new so it can't be the problem. Wrong. There's a little box checked deep in the settings that's wrecking your day. To fix this - go to device manager - Bluetooth - Intel R Wireless Bluetooth R - double click to open - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power To recap My mouse appeared to fall asleep after 1.5 seconds of inactivity and would take a good 10 seconds to wake back up.

The other day I installed a BIOS update via Dell support assist and the next time I tried to turn it on it wouldn't boot past the Dell logo. It eventually goes to the Dell recovery screen and while the scan and repair options complete successfully when I try to reboot I get the same problem. Any ideas? I would rather not refresh the OS but that looks like the only option I have left. Has anyone experienced this before? I googled around but none of the things I found seemed to work.

Hi all I just bought this XPS 15 7590 outfitted with a 4K OLED display core i7 GTX 1650 16GB of ram 512GB SSD I have a few questions. It was on sale and I had a 10% coupon for signing up for emails from Dell so I ended up paying only 1 449.12 exactly for this model. Is this a pretty good deal? I've heard that these tend to suffer from not the best thermals and some throttling I'm planning on using it mainly for web browsing movie watching music production and hopefully some lightweight gaming I realize this laptop may be overkill for what I plan on using it for but I just like using nice laptops as I spend a majority of most of my days using them. My biggest concern is that it may have some thermal issues when gaming. I choose to do most of my gaming on consoles but I do like to play the occasional game on PC such as Overwatch The Sims 4 etc. Definitely not extremely demanding games or anything. Would this laptop be fine for handling those games without major thermal issues or throttling? I'm perfectly comfortable with undervolting if needed. I just don't want it to run extremely hot. I'm also wondering about the portability I mainly use my laptop in my home and on a desk but I do like to take it from room to room and use it on the couch or in the bed. Is this laptop too heavy/bulky or would it be pretty comfortable for use like this? Thanks in advance!,0.019,0.786,0.195,0.9953,1,1

Hey guys it is this time again where we debate about GeForce vs Quadro and where people ask if the Quadro can be used for gaming and other stuff. I am interested in the upcoming XPS 17 or Precision 5750 however for reasons I would prefer the precision over the Dell Linux intel wifi etc. . What I use this for Programming robot simulations lil' gaming and a lil' machine learning majority I do in the cloud . So Naturally for me a Quadro is not advantagous. But leaving higher price to the side it seems that the Quadro is actually better than the 2060 so I wanted to explore that. because it seems that the Quadro is based on the 2070? In this comparison for example the Quadro seems to do better even having more shaders more pipelines higher boost clock but also 80 Watts vs 65!!! Is that even possible in the 17 considering I would want a 8-core i7 with that? My question is If money is no problem Is the Quadro better in the above task than the Gefore? And will it be really consuming 80W vs. the 2060s 65W?,0.041,0.886,0.073,0.6852,1,1

It's a slightly older model with an i5-8365U and a 52WHr battery. Pretty nice except if I charge to 100% shut down from the menu and turn it back on 7-10 hours later it's at 85% charge. I see many other people have similar problems. I tried disabling fast startup unchecking the IME power saving option and always disconnect from network when asleep. I even disabled WLAN and Bluetooth. Doesn't help. But this is strange too Last night I shut down with a fully charged battery. Today I plug it in turn it on and it shows 85%--the usual problem. I let it charge up to 86% shut it down unplug it wait a few minutes and turn it back on. It shows the charge is 100% . This is the reading in the BIOS and in Windows. Thoughts? I'd assume a bad battery but I see threads like this one and just don't know. I was going to do some more testing to see about this magical return to 100% before submitting a support ticket.

At this point the blue screen with bad pool call started appearing after 5 minutes of run time.

The EVGA water cooler caused some abrupt clock rate drops possibly because it had a 3-pin power connector vs the 4-pin. I'm not sure if this is the cause - however I'm speculating it may have been. I compared the noise levels while testing in Cinebench R20 and observed a major reduction in fan noise with the liquid cooler. Due to the reduced clearance caused by the power supply I believe liquid cooling is going to be the best choice to reduce fan speed while a Dynatron K666 cooler will be the easiest plug-and-play solution albeit a lot of noise . x200B The information in this video is applicable to Dell computers with the same hinged power supply bay new XPS Precision and Optiplex desktops. x200B The first video where i tested the K555 posted last weekend is The new video where I test the K666 and the EVGA liquid cooler is x200B I'm making an effort to improve the quality of these videos new gear trying to be more succinct and better overall flow - so please provide any feedback you have .,0.026,0.865,0.109,0.9569,1,1

The first monitor is a 1920x1080 at 60hz through HDMI. The second is a 3440x1440 on USB-C which can run at 120hz through the Intel HD 630 however I have had to run it at 60hz for it to be use able due to the the screen issues. The issue can start on something as simple as a single chrome tab running YouTube on one screen and another chrome tab or application running on the other. When I look at the windows performance monitor utilisation on everything is low including the discrete GPU except for the integrated graphics which is stuck at 100%. From what I've read online this is due to the dedicated 128MB VRAM which cannot be increased according to Dell themselves. Is this what's causing the issue? Has anyone else had this or knows a resolution?

I have an XPS 13 2-in-1 7390 that's about 3 months old. I rarely take it off my desk so most of the time it's plugged in. I started using it at other places recently and noticed the very poor battery life on this device. I have the i7 4K model and I understand that 4K makes the battery worse but it shouldn't be this bad right? Most of my work is just Microsoft Office and browser-based nothing CPU-intensive. I tend to leave the battery settings on better battery but not battery saver. Dell claims 16 hours on FHD and 10 hours on UHD but I've never gotten more than 4 hours. Does anyone know what's wrong? Today I manually selected sleep before unplugging it. After 8 hours of it sitting at the table it dropped from 100% to 76%. I didn't touch it nor wake it. I checked battery usage and all programs states 0% so it's not something draining the battery on the background. Thanks in advance!,0.083,0.877,0.04,-0.8093,-1,0

CPU temps are around 55-60 when the video is playing which I don't think would cause a large amount thermal throttling but I'm really not sure.

In order to do the upgrade can I simply swap out the current SSD with the new one and insert the USB stick with the Dell OS Recovery Image that I created while on the existing SSD? Or do I need to use the Windows 10 media creation tool? Is there a difference between the two? Thank you.,0.0,0.892,0.108,0.7536,1,1

Dell G7 7590 Hi So basically the title is the question is there any way to make the optimized mode default? It keeps putting me at high performance but I only want that at certain times. So I have the G7 and when I hit the F7 key it maxes my fans and puts me in high performance mode which I love to do when I'm playing games as it keeps my laptop as cool as possible while hitting max performance. However when I exit the game and hit F7 again to get out of the high performance mode it seems I get put back into the ultra performance thermal management in dell power. Also happens when I reset the computer. It's not a huge deal to go into Dell Power Manager and switch it but I was wondering if I could just make the optimized mode my default. Also in the control panel power options there is no Dell Setting only balanced and sometimes high performance. It's mostly just how long the screen stays on and basic stuff like that but I'm not 100% sure. I had to do a fresh install because I messed something up but I swear before I did that there was a specific dell power option although I could be wrong. Any way to get that back? I love this laptop it's great and Dell has been great to me and this is for sure a first-world problem...BUT if I could do something about it it would be a huge convenience for me.

After 7 years with my MBP which held up remarkably well I decided it was time to upgrade and opted for the 2019 XPS 15 7590 i9 with the 4k OLED display.

I have two laptops that I'll typically use for work...one is a 2018 Dell G5 and the other is a 2020 Dell Vostro 7590. The Vostro 7590 outclasses the G5 in every way except one...the GPU. The Vostro is running the Nvidia GTX 1050 while the G5 uses the GTX 1650. When using Chrome my work Gmail chugs on the 7590 but is as smooth as butter on the G5. I'd prefer to work on my 7590 because it's much lighter and easier to haul around but I can't figure out why Gmail struggles so much on it. One thought I had was the Chrome extensions but the same extensions run on both machines. My work email works fine in other browsers but I'm not able to run the Chrome extensions that way. My other thought was maybe the GPU but performance monitor shows that it's barely being utilized while using Gmail. Is there anything else I could try? Note - My personal Gmail account runs just fine. I open another Chrome instance without the extensions to utilize it best. x200B Spec Comparison Dell Vostro 7590 Processor Intel Core i7 - 9750H GPU Nvidia GTX 1050 RAM 16 GB SSD s 1 256 GB NVME SSD 2 500 GB SATA SSD x200B Dell G5 Processor Intel Core i5 8th gen - I forgot the exact model GPU Nvidia GTX 1650 RAM 8 GB SSD s 1 256 GB NVME SSD 2 1TB HDD,0.013,0.922,0.065,0.9136,1,1

I immediately put it to sleep but it woke up when I tried to dry the keyboard so I had to shut it down properly about a minute after the spill. I haven’t turned it back on since so I’m not sure if it works or not. After I cleaned up all the milk on the table and in the area I disassembled the laptop and unplugged the battery. I was aiming to properly clean the keyboard but the back of the keyboard was covered by Mylar which dissuaded me from wanting to peel it back and access the keyboard. The motherboard SSD and memory cards were all completely dry. A few hours after that I used a toothbrush to externally wipe water on the keyboard battery still disconnected . I would like advice on how best to deal with this situation. I have some very important group work I’ve been working on it for 4 months now that is a large project due the first week of June. I cannot use the software I need on any other computer in my house. When will it be safe to power my laptop on? Should I disassemble it again and access the keyboard to clean it? Another reason I didn’t originally is because the screw above the display cable was stripped so I couldn’t properly remove the motherboard fully. I’m optimistic my laptop will be fine but I’d like to avoid a decrease in performance. I tried calling the dell technical support but they are closed on the weekends. This laptop is 3-4 years old and probably not covered by warranty anymore. For reference the precision 5520 has the same chassis as the XPS 25. Edit is there anywhere that specializes in fixing dell laptops that I can take it if it has issues? I’m in the Bay Area so most things are closed....,0.027,0.866,0.107,0.9828,1,1

There was a sale in The Netherlands so I was able to get a good deal on the i7-9750H with the RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU The only thing I'm not super excited about is the 1TB HDD with only 5400 rpm. I read online that it was relatively easy to replace the HDD I also found instructions on how to do it in the G7 17 maintenance manual on the Dell website . I was considering replacing it with a SATA 2.5'' 1TB SSD Crucial MX500 it's 7mm so it should fit . I'm not too worried about physically replacing the hard drive although I would welcome any pointers since this will be the first time that I'm replacing components in a laptop instead of a desktop computer . I actually had a different concern/question with the order I also got a 3-year plan for premium support and the accidental damage service. I fully understand that any HDD/SDD I replace would not fall under the original warranty nor the Accidental Damage Service. However I was wondering if I open up this laptop and/or replace the HDD does that void the warranty and/or Accidental Damage Service for the entire laptop? Or just the component that I'd replace? And does it matter if the new SSD is not a Dell product since they don't exactly sell the cheapest SSDs ? Anyone any idea? Thanks..!,0.044,0.841,0.114,0.9374,1,1

Saw this link Tom Hardware SSD Comparison and if you look at this picture which shows Toshiba XG5 gave the best battery life. But I want to know how everyone's experience has been. ,0.026,0.844,0.131,0.9525,1,1

I have 16GB RAM and 512 mSATA on the E7250 nowdays it seems that it cannot bear the workload though... I want another 13 Dell so I think 9370 is a good compromise between the 9360-9380 range without breaking the bank. Also I'll be getting a used one because I never opt-in for new tech That's just me .

I have reinstalled machine with latest Windows 10 version and all the latest drivers from here and the latest bios. x200B I'm having this weird issue with the touchpad though. It works fine but if I stop using it for more than 3 seconds writes something or read something and go back to using it again there is this 1-2 second delay before it starts working again. It feels like it goes into some kind of sleep mode whenever the touchpad is not used for a few seconds.

One of the most recent issues includes a very bizarre vibration and buzzing sound coming from within. One moment the computer will be running fine and the next it will start to vibrate and buzz. It seems to happen randomly under high stress such as a game but otherwise seems fine. An outlier would be when I restarted it up right after it had an episode. Is this something to be concerned with? How can I fix it? EDIT The model is an Inspiron 15 5000 Series,0.037,0.93,0.033,-0.1171,-1,0
3,govkxa,Dell,4,2020/05/23 16:49:32,Afternoon,New laptop and switching out my primary drive before setting it all up - have some questions Ordered a Precision 7740 about a week ago and still waiting on it. I opted for only the 512GB ssd on my order because I have a Samsung Evo Plus 1TB. What I want to do before setting up my laptop with all my stuff is to add my 1TB drive and make it the primary with Windows 10 and then use the 512GB that came with it as a secondary drive to backup important files. Am I going to run into any issues with the following method? - take out the 512GB and replace with the 1TB - use the Dell RUSB yes I included it with my order to boot with. I assume that is what this is for... to reload the OS right? There wasn't a lot of information about with this was but I don't have any spare USB drives laying around so I got it with my order. - reinstall Windows 10 with the RUSB - once OS is installed on the new drive I can add back my original 512GB drive and format it I assume that would do it as long as I'm not misunderstanding what the DELL RUSB is they are sending with my laptop. I also found out about the Dell OS Recovery Tool you can download enter your id and it creates an OS image for your specific laptop. This is the same thing as the RUSB right? I assume it doesn't matter where I place my drives in the laptop either right? This particular model can fit 4 ssd drives... the locations in the laptop should not matter at all right? Or is there possibly preferred spots due to heat/cooling than others? Just looking for comments on this. I don't have my laptop yet still waiting for it to be shipped but when it does come I don't want to run into any issues while doing this. Thanks for any info.,0.007,0.922,0.071,0.9638,1,1

The ping is definately not the problem as it sits at about 24 mps. I have noticed that when I play it my laptop gets pretty hot but I don't know if it's overheating. If it is how would fix it?

XPS 7590 Related  I use it heavily the application key the one that brings up the context menu because i'm pretty much only a keyboard typer. HOWEVER both my 7590 and my cooler master Masterkeys Pro lack this feature standard with the 7590 having the key accessible through right CTRL when the function keys are not swapped with the media keys. I find this annoying but less egregious then my Masterkeys pro this is because not being lazy on a laptop doesn't have the same reach required to right click a misspelled word that my desktop has. I simply move the mouse with my thumb and then right click with they physical button all without moving my hands from the home row... I might have a pretty decent reach to do this... So this brings me to the core question here. Who actually uses the application key? and if dell were to make a firmware update available that enables you to swap right ctrl with the application key without swapping the media keys would you use it? For those that are good at typing what do you value in a keyboard on a laptop or otherwise? and finally for those that have an XPS how does the typing experience compare to other keyboards and laptops you have used?,0.016,0.9,0.084,0.9389,1,1

Opened it up and started it after going through initial setup. Beautiful laptop tiny screen edges ir camera ...Run dell update app to install latest software. The very first reboot caused BSOD reg Realtek sound driver I guess. rebooted ok sound works did not pay much attn. But...sound would all of the sudden stop working not muted with volume maxed up nothing. Reboot brings back everything to normal. Same thing with BT just shuts itself and my mouse or my iphone bt connection stops working. Figured it out that Power Management in BT driver should be ticked off not to save power. Next thing is that if I leave it idle with screen opened and no apps running it starts overheating so bad. And I mean that you almost can't hold your hand bellow. Black screen but can still hear fans and holding power off button for 20 sec or so would not shut it down. It happened several times after that. Another BSOD reg sound card follows up. I removed and installed different driver as recommended from Dell. As soon as I thought ok sound is ok now another BSOD...so gave up. I am an IT guy with 20 yrs of experience and got sick and tired spending time to troubleshoot something that is like a week old. Sent it back. Very disappointed as I liked the hardware feel and look.

1,gonxfb,Dell,0,2020/05/23 09:39:54,Morning,Dell Inspiron 13' 7370 dead in a 1.5 years of use This was my first Dell Laptop and I thought I'd purchase a mid-tier Ultrabook and went with the 7370 this was in January 2019. I was extremely happy with the laptop and wondered why I never chose to go with Dell sooner since I was always an HP guy but boy oh boy was I in for a ride. The hinges broke and separated from under the display while I was opening the laptop and I got it fixed. I thought it's alright perhaps this was just a one off. Well a month later and suddenly the laptop is literally refusing to start nor does it even register that it is charging the laptop has a light that indicates its charging well I was like perhaps the battery was disconnected but I was wrong I flip over the laptop open the base and the battery is connected. I plug the charger in and I suddenly notice that the laptop is heating up and I realize that the onboard i5 8th gen is heating up without the laptop even being turned on i.e. the processor has shorted out. All of this insanity in a year of use my dads been using Dell laptops for over 15 years and he has never seen this happen on any laptop within a year. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement I payed over 800 for this laptop and now I'm left with a god damn case. Replacing the motherboard will cost around 200 and God knows how long that motherboard will last. The build quality at Dell is clearly not up to standard and I am left without a laptop in this pandemic. Honestly I really enjoyed the time I spent with the laptop but I expect a laptop to last at least 5 years of use not a year and a half I've never had any laptop die on me and my laptop from 2004 works like a charm.

The MD1200 is attached to an R720 rack server with the freeNAS machine virtualised under VmWare. The two are connected using an LSI HBA PCI card which provides JBOD access to the disks in the MD1200. FreeNAS doesn't like RAID controllers like the Dell Perc cards. So it works but the MD1200 is way noisy. I'm hoping someone can shed some light on this situation because I see three possibilities 1. MD1200 is just a noisy piece of gear 2. The MD1200 is upset because it's not hanging off a Perc card or 3. The MD1200 is upset because currently not all of its 12 bays are full. As things sit I'm not sure I can put up with so much noise but it does seem to me like the fans are all running at full - indicating a 'fault' of some nature. All status lights are happy power supply interface units and front panel and there's no console to interrogate on the MD1200. I'm a bit stuck as to how to troubleshoot this and I don't have access to enough caddys to fill every slot. I'd buy these if I knew the MD1200 was a keeper but I don't want to buy more if the gear ends up getting discarded. Thanks for any thoughts.,0.111,0.824,0.066,-0.7718,-1,0

1,golshx,Dell,2,2020/05/23 07:49:27,Morning,Just found out my Dell laptop doesn't support G-Sync and I bought a G-Sync monitor. Should I return? I'm very new to buying high-performance gaming tech and I believe I've made a mistake. I have a Dell G3 I3590 this one and was shopping for an external monitor with G-Sync as I have NVIDIA and was looking to maximize performance. I purchased this monitor after much searching but soon found out that the usb-c displayport alt-mode on my laptop runs through the default Intel GPU not the NVIDIA GPU. Therefore G-Sync will not work. this thread informed me I know I'll still get 144hz performance with this monitor but I'm wondering if it's worth the premium I paid for G-SYNC. Also the monitor's HDMI port only supports HDMI 1.4 capping at 60hz. This is relevant because I plan to buy the next-gen Xbox in the winter and since that supports HDMI 2.1 I think it can get up to 120hz. Anyway I was searching for a long-term multi-use monitor to take advantage of gaming with high-refresh rates. And I'm having buyer's remorse. Help me.,0.033,0.885,0.082,0.8727,1,1

What is the best thermal paste to purchase? I was thinking about getting the Noctua brand... 2. What app on Windows or Linux can I use to do some before / after measurements on CPU Heat and/or throttling? The video I linked shows an application being used but I can't see the name of the App. 3. Anything else I should do while I'm in there? I'll get a can of compressed air and try to get all the dust out as best as I can. But is there anything else I should be doing?

As someone who texts with friends through snapchat I'm often working on my laptop and snapchatting at the same time. When I use the mobile control with snapchat it says that I'm screen recording.

I had it set to 50%-80% based on recommendations I had read but my problem is that even when I use it on battery I typically don't use it long enough to get low enough for it to charge. so if I have to use it for an extended period of time eventually there will come a time when It is stuck at 52% or something. and then I'll be screwed. so I set it to 70%-80%. Of course I set the power manager on my taskbar so I could change it but I have to open the power manager click on settings etc. and it's a slight ordeal. and then I have to remember to go back into and turn it off.

No idea how long it has been like this but it based off other posts on the sub it might have been this way for a couple of months now. Very saddened to not see Dell standing behind their product on this one. I mean either there's a defective part or maybe a second source being used at the factor or a design flaw. Not for an instant buying you are supposed to pick up and put down a laptop when moving it on a table. I can say that I've slide my Surface Studio around 360 degrees or from person to person and with a 28 monitor I would not call that mobile. Laptops are made to be moved so pick up and put down isn't going to fly. When I contacted support they told me to call paid support which sounds very expensive and very futile based off what other people have been told so I thought I'd ask here What can I do to repair this?

I would like to get your opinions/thoughts on this I had an issue with my Dell XPS 15 7590 in which the WIFI would disconnect every 5 minutes or so and I would be unable to reconnect for 30 seconds getting the message unable to connect to this network . I contacted Dell support and after doing all the recommended driver stuff they sent someone out to replace the wireless card. I got a day without any wifi issues but now it's back to the original issue. I then read online that sometimes if you have set your wifi to public this issue can arise so I changed to private and that bought me another disconnect free day but now I am back to the same issue. Is this perhaps I problem with my modem which has received no software update recently and I haven't messed around with and the XPS was fine with it for the previous 5 months ? I tried connecting to another wifi network a TP link powerline extender and so far I have had no disconnects. I am very confused by this.

For the first following week I tried getting a return started through email and received no response for a week. I then received an email saying that someone else had picked up my support ticket. He asked me if I wanted to process a return to which I obviously said yes why ask again? . I've send him two more follow up emails but I still haven't received word from him. In the second following week I used chat support. The customer rep supposedly processed my return request and said that I would receive an email confirmation and a return label within the next 48 hours. Still haven't received anything. Today I tried contacting support through phone. After finally reaching someone after 45 minutes of waiting and 2 redirects I got through to someone and was asked my order number. The rep said to wait a few minutes while they go and retrieve information. A few minutes later the call was disconnected. I'm actually very surprised at what's going on. I've been courteous and patient but this is getting ridiculous. It'll be 30 days since my purchase in a few days and I don't think I'm going to be able to get my return.

Build quality is good no coil whine but waiting on a screen change because of some hot pixels on the 4k display. The most annoying issue I'm coming across so far is my pointing devices. I connected my only wireless mouse a MS Surface Arc mouse via Bluetooth. If I leave the mouse stationary for any length of time it will not respond the next time I move it. It does register the movement though. After about 4-5 seconds the mouse will then jump to where it was that I moved it. I went into the mouse power settings and unchecked allow this computer to turn off this device to save power. When the cursour locks up the touch pad won't move the mouse either until the 4-5 seconds have passed. This also stores up the movement data and moves the cursor the amout that it moved while locked up. One other pointer issue I'm coming across is that the touchpad stops responding when multiple keys are pressed. I play some low power games from time to time such as Half Life 2 but the mouse is currently useless with the locking up issue and if I use the touchpad it won't respond while keys like w and s are held at the same time.

I am of the philosophy that if I am going to spend a large amount of money on technology I want good warranty and support. I don't agree with spending 4000 dollars on a laptop but it only has a 3 year warranty i.e. MBP 16 or Razer Blade Studio . That seems insane to spend that much money for such little support time. What I really like about Dell is that the precision line can give me 5 year Pro-support if desired. I do not mind spending an additional 400-500 bucks for 5 years of support if anything breaks down. Even the XPS goes up to 4 years which is much better than 3 years. I like to keep the same laptop between 5-6 years and it has worked out well in the past.

5,gnl42v,Dell,4,2020/05/21 15:01:01,Afternoon,Questions about Dell XPS 15 2019  Hi everyone. I am looking forward to purchase an XPS 15 2019 model but there are a few things that I would like to ask first. Keep in mind that I am interested in the very basic configuration the cheapest one . So 1. I know that the 2017 model had some issues with the keyboard. At the time some users said there was a problem in some keys that would not respond while fast-typing on the computer and always had to double check what they were writing in order to avoid spelling mistakes. I wonder if the 2019 model of the XPS 15 has that problem too...or has Dell fixed it? How would you rate your keyboard? 2. Does the cheapest configuration have the 6 cells 97Wh battery? Or does it have a smaller battery like the cheapest config of the 2020 model 56Wh compared to the 86Wh for the rest of the configurations ? 3. Have you noticed any burn-in effect in the display since you purchased it? 4. What components are soldered into the motherboard? I heard few of them are actually not replaceable. This could actually be a problem if one wants to upgrade certains things. For instance replacing the killer wireless card or the ssd to add storage capacity etc...

I tried some tricks I found online but the same problem still remains. So i put it to sleep and left it that way. This is problem number1 Today I noticed that the power button of my laptop doesn't do anything when I press it or hold it Doesn't sleep or shuts down even though the LED is on.

I just have a few questions to help guide my decision. I intend on getting a model with a touchscreen just to draw some simple diagrams in class. Will the regular XPS with touchscreen be sufficiently precise/sensitive for this? I do not otherwise need the precise control of a pen and hesitate to get the 2 in 1 just for some simple drawings. I also really like the sound of the 4k display but am also open to getting the 1080p touchscreen if battery life is significantly worse. Does anyone have any numbers for the 4k version?

The hinge on my 4-year-old XPS 13 has been giving me trouble for several months and the whole thing finally kind of came apart catastrophically. I decided I'd like to try to remove the screen completely and use the body through my TV. After doing this the computer will boot and I'll get an image through USBC/HDMI but no matter what the computer shuts off after 35 seconds. Doesn't matter if I'm in BIOS or have managed to do everything fast enough to be loading the OS by then. I've tried with and without the WIFI card and the battery. The one thing that isn't intact aside of course from the monitor camera and wifi cables being disconnected is that I couldn't disconnect the card reader power which is tightly attached to the screen power cable and ended up breaking the cable trying. So the cable's head is still plugged into the motherboad near the card reader but there's no cable coming out of it. Could that be my issue? Any other ideas for things to try?

I use ThrottleStop on Windows and intel-undervolt on Linux to undervolt the CPU and the iGPU but they were not working at all. Simply rolling back the firmware to version 1.13.1 did not help so I upgraded it again and tried the Factory reset trick in the BIOS Restore settings button . Afterwards undervolting re-started working again. I could confirm it only on Linux using intel-undervolt read because ThrottleStop on Windows isn't giving me correct readings anymore nevertheless the laptop is running cool again .

Hi everyone I bought this dell g7 laptop secondhand a while ago and im pretty happy with it at the moment but i am running into a persistent issue. I flashed the gpu bios to a different one with a higher tdp 80w to 90w but the gpu and cpu are cooled using thermal grizzly conductonaut liquid metal so the cpu temps never hit 80c while gaming and the gpu hovers around 75c or so. The issue I've had though is even with these relatively low temperatures the computer goes into sleep mode while playing games. I use an external monitor which says loading for a split second before turning off and then the laptop itself seems to turn off but if I hit the power button it starts up again with the same apps still running so I assume its going into sleep mode. I have hwinfo64 to monitor temperatures but is there maybe some sensor im missing or not aware of thats causing the computer to go into sleep mode. I wonder if it could also be due to having flashed a different bios on to the laptop gpu with a higher tdp.. but at the same time my temperatures are pretty low. I did notice though that the conductors on the cpu and gpu the whole green area besides the chip itself seemed to be covered in this black tape which might be insulating heat somehow but it doesnt reflect in the temperatures in HWINFO64. x200B If anyone has any advice ty ahead of time.,0.03,0.917,0.053,0.7391,1,1

It's especially noticable when using medium heavy Adobe- and CAD-programs and I expereince drops down to 800MHz . Even opening a browser makes it go down to 800. The throttling is happening even though the temperature is low and the TDP is around 15-20W so I guess this doesn't have anything to do with temperature. The fans are rarely spinning anyways which I find strange during heavy load. I've also undervolted -0 100V without any effect on the throttling. As you can see in the screenshots it's power throttling some in idle not great not terrible and throttling a lot during stress test. I thought throttling only happened either when the temperature is to high or when the computer is running on battery?

1,gni5ad,Dell,2,2020/05/21 11:33:00,Morning,XPS 15 9575 GPU Problems Hey all I have been having some issue the past 2-3 weeks with my XPS's performance when playing video games. I don't play video games much but enjoy doing so occasionally. I mostly use my laptop for work. I have had it for about 3 years now. I usually play CS GO or SC2 both on relatively medium settings 1920x1080 resolution on a 32' 4k monitor fullscreen. I have the dedicated Radeon Vega card set to utilize during gaming. I have never had any issues with gaming. Recently though I have been encountering pretty hard stuttering during my gaming sessions which last 1-2.5 hours . I will boot up one of the two games and it will work fine for maybe 10-15 minutes then it will start stuttering hard sometimes experiencing 1-2 minutes of smooth gameplay before stuttering again. I have some suspicions but am not entirely sure what could be causing this. At first I thought it was an internet issue given the notoriety and my past issues with the Killer card but everything runs fine and smooth when streaming Youtube or other video/surfing the web. Also when working using a low-intensity platform that still requires a constant fast server connection I have no issue. It is only with games so I don't think it is fundamentally an internet issue though I could be wrong. Speedtests give a consistent 150-200ish download. Though my ping in-game for CSGO always floats at about 40. In the past 2-3 weeks two big things have happened. 1 I have had several system updates from Dell for Windows 10 and 2 Summer weather 80 degrees has set in where I live. So I think it may be either an issue caused by the updates messing with the drivers/cards or overheating. Attached are 3 images. The first image is of the Task Manager when the stuttering is occurring during gaming. As you can see there are these weird spikes where the Dedicated Radeon GPU stops functioning being taken over by the Integrated Intel card which presumably cannot handle the workload. Also this weird thing happens with the Wifi and I don't know how to interpret it. Could the processing of internet signal be the cause/effect of graphical overload? The second image is when the stuttering stops and the game runs smoothly for a couple minutes. As you can see the Radeon GPU returns to a regularly functioning level the Intel takes a backseat and the Wifi remains at a steady 300-ish. The third image is right when I boot the game up CSGO and it is running smoothly. Wifi is smooth the Intel is at a smooth 20% and the Radeon GPU is fully functioning the dip at the end is just because I stopped moving my in-game character to take the screenshot not an anomoly . I do find it off that in order to run a small windowed CSGO which I did just to take these screenshots the Radeon card is running at 100% but that may be normal for all I know. The game wasn't stuttering during that period so it may be fine. Please let me know if anyone is having this problem or knows why this is happening. This is frustrating and my knowledge of computers is not quite sufficient to really know what is going on here or if my internet is involved. I suspect it may be overheating because it does indeed get quite hot and the game runs smoothly the longest when I first boot it up indicating the computer is fine until it eventually heats up plus the warmer weather in the past couple weeks. Thank you for the help! x200B Image 1 In-Game during stuttering x200B Image 2 In-Game when running smooth in between stuttering period Image 3 Right after I boot up and start playing with smooth performance ,0.112,0.827,0.061,-0.9845,-1,0

The XPS 15 has always been a solid laptop with a few problems one of which being the Killer wifi card. On the past few models we have been able to replace this card for the far better intel variant. But now Dell has permanently adhered the card to the motherboard looking at Dave's pictures which makes the switch to intel cards no longer a viable option. x200B Do you guys think that the new 9500 will still have these wifi problems?

The laptop is 2.4 years old. I now have a number of problems Keyboard button Z no longer works without smashing it! I haven't dropped anything on it and this happened just after the one year. Charging Port has failed - No longer charges and seems like the port has failed. I have resorted to using the USB C port for charging. Battery - The battery health is pretty terrible too. 40% and the battery will just train to 0 within a few minutes. The original charger blew up - I expect this was a power problem at the hotel but still. I went from a Macbook Pro to this Dell and typically I kept Apple laptops for at least 4 years but I don't think this Dell laptop will even make it to 3 years never mind 4 years. Have you guys experienced the same? Do you think I should upgrade? - I like the look of the new XPS 15 but my trust in Dell is lacking. Or switch back to Apple. The only thing Dell has going for it is that they seem to go on Sale every year. So replacing a Dell every 2 or so years at 1800 what I paid for this one would still work out cheaper than buy a top end macbook for 4 years.

How am I sure the machine was off? In the Windows task manager in the tab performance the up time resets to 0 after turning it on. My previous XPS 13 7390 2-in-1 was replaced in the past because the battery drained too much at night and technical support couldn't solve this problem. My current XPS is draining 15% battery capacity each night on average. I didn't change the battery settings and kept them default. I use powercfg /batteryreport in CMD. After shutting down in the evenings or nights the system keeps draining the battery. When turning it on in the morning which is usually 8-12 hours later the machine lost 5000-10000 mWh. There's no difference if the lid is closed or open. Or if the charging cable or thunderbolt cable for WD19TB is connected or not. This battery drain is too much. The design capacity of the battery is 49 985 mWh and right now mine charges up to 46 178 mWh after a few months.

16,gmp6vs,Dell,41,2020/05/20 06:05:13,Night,Was bored -- My predictions for the new Dell XPS 15 17 reviews Trigger Warning don't hate me too much  Design Everyone are gonna praise the design. It looks aesthetically great and stronger than before. There will be a divide between people saying they should have went all aluminum or keeping the ‘carbon fibre’. People will find issues with the obsession to reduce thickness. Moreover people will have to note that these laptops are thicker than claimed due to the raised rubber feet. People will be annoyed with the fact that they made the XPS 15 smaller leading it to perform only 10% better than the previous XPS 15 all with the intention to get people to spend more on the “real” upgrade the XPS 17. People will find QC defects that are unexpected reminding them this is still not Apple. Some people are not gonna like the fact that the palm rest and trackpad are fingerprint magnets. The coating on the trackpad will be worn off after a few months OR it'll be impossible to remove the remaining grease. x200B Ports People will be disappointed with the ports on the XPS 15. Again intentionally made smaller to provide a lesser experience. People will praise Dell for embracing the future proof thunderbolt 3 ports in general. It will take people a little bit of testing to understand that the thunderbolt 3 controllers are limited somehow in their operation. For example when plugging in 4 usb c cables in the XPS 17 the performance will suffer somehow. People will start pointing out that sd card readers are not enough. They exclude XQD and CF Express cards. These are a waste of motherboard space considering the embracement of thunderbolt 3. This will probably never happen because the YouTube bubble usually uses the same camera gear all of which use sd cards . x200B Display People will LOVE the displays. As usual the 1080p screen will be great. The 4k screen will be amazing. People will not like the fact that they can’t see a part of their 16 10 screens when they type. Their fingers will cover a portion of the lower display. People will complain about some kind of backed in battery saving options such as auto brightness that can’t be fully turned off for some reason. x200B Battery People will take issue with the battery life on both machines. On paper they’ll look very promising. In reality both will get slightly lower battery life or the same but not better. Again the obsession with reducing thickness combined with the fact that you can’t put more than 100w battery inside means slightly worse battery life unless windows 10 and the new components are much more power efficient all of a sudden . For some mysterious reason the batteries in these machines will degrade much quicker than the competition. No one will know why and people will talk about it only in forums. x200B Thermals The XPS 17 will perform great. People will forget we’re talking about RTX 2060 or lower. Since Dell under delivered for 4 years straight people will praise them very much for improving the same design they insisted on for years. People will still re-paste the thermal solution in their XPS. There will be zero discussion on why a manufacturer is unable to apply proper thermal paste. x200B Other Speakers will be better but always behind the competition. The speaker grills will be full of dust and dirt very quickly. People will realize that only a few companies can pull this off perfectly. The keyboard will have limited options for backlight levels. The keyboard will have backlight bleed. The trackpad is be praised very much. People will also find out that the trackpad is too big and palm rejection needs work. People will notice that in some units the trackpad is either too lose or not sitting flush with the palm rest.,0.082,0.825,0.093,0.952,1,1

Different hard drives different purposes. Specs here The 500Gb hard drive running openSUSE is used to edit pictures personal e-mail reading how to set up and break a raspberry pi and browse reddit. The second 500Gb hard drive running windows is used for work. The options I had by mid-March 2020 -when it all started- were 1. Install windows and use my equipment to work. 2. Bring home a company PC that I don't want to make room for and assume any damage to it. With a little effort I might have been able to use a virtual windows machine for work woulda coulda shoulda but Citrix is a bitch the company's VPN is a cunt and I am not that smart. What I opted for was to install windows on a second hard drive and that is how I've been living my life ever since. Windows from 7h to 15h on disk A openSUSE from 18h to 22h on disk B. The use and abuse on this Dell is showing. I have noticed especially while using windows that programs now take 3 or 5 seconds to launch when it used to be just 1. After some reading and asking around I now know that my searches should be based on Optiplex 7010 compatible not Linux compatible not Windows compatible. Someone in the Dell forum solved a similar issue with this part but it was discontinued 3 years ago. Page 13 of the optiplex 7010 technical guidebook from 2012 mentions a minimum of 2GB and a maximum of 16GB paired memory modules so I won't be doing 32x2 not that I need that either but the document is 8 years old. YES the machine is old. NO my life does not depend on it so buying a new PC is not a priority. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

The two fixes I’ve seen in here were to factory reset BIOS settings and downgrading. I’ve tried the factory reset but to no avail. Now trying to downgrade there is no option to boot to the USB that has the BIOS file on it when I hit F12 on startup. In the video I watched it was under LEGACY BOOT MODE but for me it says UEFI BOOT MODE and the option isn’t there. Does anyone know what I may need to do to downgrade the BIOS?

One big issue I have with it is that Dell no longer supports drivers for it for Windows 10 nor was it tested for Windows 10. I’m not sure what to make of that information. I have a few more weeks to be able to return it but I’m curious about how much this would affect it overall. For example could I download drivers for a model that does support Windows 10? I could totally be overthinking this but I’m also now wondering if I can get a laptop that was tested for Windows 10 that does still have driver supported for the same price.

They've been great. Tripped on the stairs at home while carrying it open slippery socks and threw it down the stairs as I caught myself. Aluminum case is majorly bent. As a testament to the build quality the laptop is working fine I'm using it right now . Unfortunately a corner of the screen is cracked and leaking LCD in the corner. Screen at least needs to be replaced. I logged into Dell support to enter a ticket when I realized I don't have Accidental Coverage. Whoops. However when I logged in they offered me to extend the On-Site Support policy I have with a 25% discount and I was able to add Accidental Coverage. I tried to see the policy to see if the damage would be excluded and couldn't find anything clear so I purchased. Surprised they let me do it. Then I called them and was told since I just bought Accidental Coverage I had to wait 30 days to enter a claim. Bummer but I can understand. I also tried Twitter. Same result. I can deal with the time but what will stink is when the 30 days is up if they deny it as preexisting damage which now that I have the full policy is pretty clear. However the twitter person said never fear they would get me going after 30 days. The Twitter operator fully aware of the situation replied I assure you that we shall get this fixed. However I fear my honesty will get my future claim denied outright. What do you think will happen? Such a bummer as I am a fanboy evangelist for Dell and the decision maker at work. I usually buy Complete Care/Accidental Damage but in this case I just screwed up. Never made a claim in over 10 years with them for damage like this.

1,gmt9uy,Dell,6,2020/05/20 09:39:20,Morning,XPS 15 is Turning into a Brick Please Help Me TLDR My XPS runs extremely hot idling at 60-65 deg C and I have no idea why. x200B My XPS 15 has had problems since day one if I'm being honest but in the past couple months I've been having a major thermal throttling issue. I can no longer even run CSGO with a consistent 60 frames due to thermal throttling lowering my fps. Mind you when I say thermal throttling I don't mean throttling at like 80 degrees C I mean it shoots all the way up to 96 degrees and then throttles like it just hit the depths of hell and is attempting to come back up to the surface. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone - my two friends with the same model have also gone through constant struggles to keep theirs running properly. I digress. x200B I used XTU for awhile to undervolt then I went to throttlestop then I went back to XTU then I went to throttlestop again and that's where I''m at now. I have CPU core and cache at a safe it can go higher 120mv undervolt and the iGPU at -65mv. Not much else is changed in there aside from the Speedshift setting which I have set at 80 to prefer performance over battery since it's plugged in 90% of the time and I have a battery profile for when it's on battery . I also use MSI afterburner for the nvidia GPU when running games however that seems to do absolutely nothing on my machine - my friends have had success with it. x200B I am going to be repasting the thermal paste in the next couple days as well as adding some thermal pads hopefully that will help but I know for certain that there is something else going on here regarding software that I can't figure out. Something is seriously wrong with what I have - it should not be running this hot. My one friend with the exact same build of the laptop as me gets 15-20 degrees C cooler than me on any task and I've replicated his settings several times. I'm really at a loss. x200B Should I fresh install Windows again ? Would that help at all? Could it help? Any software recommendations?

I have a XPS 15 9570 and a few weeks ago I started getting the AC adapter isn't recognized error which at the time was annoying but whatever I looked into replacing the charging port myself although I decided to ship it in as I thought I would surely screw something up in my computer if I were to try to replace it myself. So after a week I finally received my laptop back from Dell good news right? Nope. Somehow they bricked my computer and now I get the error that my hard drive is Not Installed . So now I have to send it back in to the repair center to fix an issue that could've been identified if ANYONE at the repair center would've simply tried to turn on my computer as the error I am getting now prevents me from booting up my computer. As someone who is a Student currently in virtual class along with an internship starting next week I need my computer more or less everyday and was struggling during the time that my computer was in repair. I am not sure what this will accomplish but it fucking pisses me off that I spent 120 dollars to repair my computer because I was worried about fixing it myself for 10 dollars when Dell made it worse than I would have if I tried to do this myself. I've spent hours on hours with customer support only to be treated like I don't know what I am doing or left on hold for god knows how long. I do love my laptop when it is functional but this is ridiculous to me and it's even more ridiculous that this appears to be a COMMON issue for others dealing with Dell's terrible support.

1,gmrjih,Dell,2,2020/05/20 08:10:40,Morning,My XPS 15 9560 is having some very annoying issues... So I've had my XPS 15 9560 for about 2 years now. Since I've had a lot more free time I've been gaming on it a lot more than usual. The main titles I play are games like Minecraft League of Legends or Skyrim which actually runs great . A few weeks ago I started playing Minecraft again and it has been quite a fun experience until I started getting these very annoying FPS drops in game. The game runs smoothly for a little while on about 50-60 FPS and then this issue just hits seemingly randomly out of nowhere and the FPS drops dramatically down to about 0-1 FPS basically unplayable. I first assumed it was just a server issue or internet connectivity problems but as soon as I fully close down Minecraft that laggyness and spikes of extreme slowness still persist and make my system pretty much unusable. So far the only fix was to just calmly take a deep breath and restart my laptop and then generally things would go back to normal and I could play again until of course the problem comes back . Now after not having played Minecraft for a week or so I've been playing League of Legends. Same problem! Not only that I get these bouts of laggyness and my mouse for example just jitters around not being smooth at all. So I tried to find some solutions. What I've done so far was to change Dell's Power Settings to Ultra Mode update drivers reinstall drivers give my Nvidia Graphics card priority graphic settings... Still not working after all this. I'm starting to think it might be a hardware issue? I love my machine and hope I can use it for a lot longer it was hefty purchase afterall So I would massively appreciate any help at all with this issue. Please also don't hesitate to ask for more information or system screenshots or whatever it takes to fix my baby and for me to be able to just simply play a game of League or Minecraft every once in a while.

My model has the base i5 1035G1 16gb of RAM the 1080p matte finish display and 256gb of storage. Build quality If Macbooks have a 10/10 on build quality this laptop has an 8.5. I would give it a 9 but my machine has a few build issues with the screen up the front left corner of the laptop doesn't lay flat and a bit of light leakage on the bottom left corner of the screen . It feels very solid and premium but just a cut below a MBP. Screen Pretty good screen can't complain. Matte works well for me and can get rather bright. Where my previous mid-range laptops have left me wanting more this screen delivers. CPU I just code so I haven't pushed it very hard but this thing runs well over the advertised 1ghz on all battery settings. I'm also running an external monitor through the laptop and the fans only come on when I'm charging my laptop so it seems to handle simple tasks with total ease. Other stuff Fans don't get loud loud for gaming definitely upgrade to the CPU with the Irus Plus graphics 60fps in LoL but not smooth the keyboard is AWESOME super light 16 by 10 monitor ratio is super nice around 10 hours of battery life for me so far and that's it.

I was looking at the XPS 13 for a while but was also waiting to see what the new xps 15 would look like. When it was released last week I loved the new design and specs etc. I ordered it the next day through the Netherlands store with the i7 dedicated graphics 16gb ram 1tb storage and UHD display with 10% student discount for 2339 euro's 2599 original price . Although I understand the XPS 15 is not a gaming laptop I like how it still would allow me to occasionally play some other total war games and maybe GTA 5 Im not a hardcore gamer which would be fine for me. For some reason I also got 5 year accidental damage protection for free so I just had to order it. However the more I read about the new XPS 15 and how amazing it is the more ridiculous the prices compared are to last years model and getting close to MBP 16's price makes me in doubt of cancelling it and order the XPS 13 instead. Saving me 600 euro's but costing me gaming ability performance and the bigger display. Can anyone help me make up my mind is it worth the additional 600 euro's investment? I use the device primarily for college but the ability to game is a big perk to me. x200B Thanks!

Here I have a Dell U2719DC monitor that I can directly connect using a single USB-C cable to the laptop. This cable provides charge image and enables the USB-A ports from the monitor where I usually have a headset and a keyboard plugged in. For the past couple of months I have noticed that if I touch this cable even in the slightest the peripherals plugged into the monitor will momentarily disconnect but the image continues working . Some days the monitor is not recognized at all in one of the ports and I have to use the other one. But then the next day works again which is very confusing. I have tested the monitor and cable with my personal laptop Macbook Pro and no matter how rude I am with the cable the image and connected peripherals remain stable. After testing this I contacted Dell because the laptop is still within warranty period. We ran the diagnostics utility which reported one error. They sent a technician to swap the motherboard which should fix the problem. And it did. But only for a day. Now I've been having the same issues again for a week. Only difference is that now the diagnosis does not report any error. Today I called them again to report that the repair was not successful. His suggestion is to buy another USB-C cable and test it which honestly I don't feel like doing or send the laptop to their lab which can take up to two weeks. Obviously I need the computer to work and I would have to extract all of the confidential information from the hard drive which is also a hassle. That would you guys suggest? Buy another cable? Send the laptop? Is there another option that we are missing? Thanks in advance! and let me know if you want some additional information,0.095,0.867,0.038,-0.9657,-1,0

Looking for more space cost-effective yet reliable for a daily driver main SSD I use the laptop for gaming and other casual things some code development.

Generally speaking the WD19TB works fine the connection to my screen Dell Ultrasharp 27 is stable and everything works as intended. Until the moment I plug in a device to my laptop or the docking station itself. It can be anything from my iPhone to an external hard drive as soon as I plug it in the USB ports and the Ethernet port on the dock go dark. The monitor connection stays stable though. Only after I reboot the computer is everything fine again. Though when I unplug the aforementioned device same thing happens and I need to reboot again. I installed all the updates from the WD19TB product page but this didn't resolve this problem. While googling around I found some similar threads about Dell laptops running Ubuntu which weren't really helpful for me. Anyone got an idea here?

However in doing so I spotted that it looks almost like a straight swap of the mainboard to bring my 9350 up to an XPS 9360 with the i7-7560 16Gb board. Everything else chassis wise is straight swap. I've been offered a working mainboard and new 9360 battery for a great price.

And I try to get out of the Apple ecosystem since the last 6 years but had no success. Today I tested the XPS 13 9300. It's a somewhat fine machine but some points are still really bothering. - The speakers are incredeibly bad. No highes everything sound like under a blanket they are just embarrasing - The trackpad is sadly still garbage if you're used to a Mac. For example you can't easily click on the top edge I always do it when I write with 10 fingers... - Coil whine.... No words for that the electronics want to speak with you it's crazy - Fan curve is way to hectic it feels like it has only 3 modes off medium and fullblown. Why can't DELL regulate the fans without steps like a Mac? I really don't get it... - The keyboard feels really mushy and too soft and thats coming from a shitty Butterfly keyboard user - The silicone finish is a real turnoff and please stop calling it carbon fiber we all know it's just carbon fiber optics and in reality it's just plain old silicone On the other hand the display is damn epic finally 16 10!!!!

Info-Primary Battery More Info 56WHr Integrated When I'm on wall power or AC power basically plugged in then I get 100% CPU performance in the stress test. When I plug out then performance drops to 33% and stays there until I plug the power in back again after which it will achieve full performance. I don't think it's because of thermal throttling as even if I start the test on battery power when the CPU is cool still it can't go above 33%. This can be seen in the video and all the power plans are set to ultra-performance etc along with fan speed as well.

Apart from it being a beast with an amazing screen I am having some I believe graphics issues that I haven't been able to resolve. When Alt-Tabbing sometimes it happens that the screen stutters. In some cases I have seen a frozen screen audio still works and needed a hard reset. In most cases work continues normally after a stutter of 5 secs. When this happens I am receiving a Windows / Hardware Error in the Windows 10 Reliability Monitor. My guess is that Intel Iris drivers provoke this error to happen. I have Dell Command Update installed and have already performed an Advanced Driver Restore. I have also installed the newest stable Intel Iris drivers downloaded directly from Intel.

I discussed the issue with Microsoft Windows support today and we verified I have the latest Windows 10 Version 1909 software bios and drivers. The flickering horizontal purple bars issue persists. I spoke with a Dell technician Angad tonight and he thinks it is a hardware issue now ie. loose connection to the camera ? He would not do further testing because I am out of warranty buy a month?

Firstly the laptop will mostly be for personal use watching movies web browsing travel some gaming not much if any . I'll also use it for work but that's typically more light internet use video calls and Microsoft office use. My issue deciding lies in the configuration options I am left to decide between. I don't particularly want touch screen as I don't think I'd ever use it and therefor would be paying more plus adding some weight for something I don't even want. Problem is I can't get the i7 without getting the touch screen. My questions are as follows 1. What is the difference between the non-touch anti-glare screen vs the touch anti-reflective screen? In what way would I notice these differences? 2. Is there a battery performance difference between the i5 non touch and the i7 touch configuration? I know the 4k model has significant loss. I do not want that model 3. i5 vs i7 differences? As far as I understand the major differences is the G7 graphics which would mostly or only matter if I was going to do some heavy gaming. Am I correct on this? Is it any faster or better for general use? x200B After looking through my options I'm left deciding between the following two configurations 1. i5 processor 16GB RAM 512GB SSD FHD Non Touch Display Black Carbon - 1 849.99 CDN 2. i7 processor 16GB RAM 512GB SSD FHD Touch Display Black Carbon - 2 199.99 CDN x200B Which model would you suggest I buy?

1,gmcozt,Dell,3,2020/05/19 15:16:46,Afternoon,xps 9560 running 10 degrees hotter When I received my dell xps 9560 as with most others it ran a bit hot. I reapplied thermal past NT-H1 reseated thermal pads as they were not really placed very well. One wasnt even on the chip! I also undervolted to a a solid -0.650mV which has been stable thus far playing games and some light editing. I noticed the other day that the cpu while idle is running around 40-42 instead of 30-32 which it was previously after all of the above. Also while gaming its running around 80-85 when previously was a stable 70. The undervolt appears to be taking. I used HWmonitor and could see the value change. I also extreme undervolted to -0.190 and instant blue screen. Is there a chance the thermal compound is baked and needs replaced? Its been on around 2 years and seen good gaming time. I cant think of anything else that could be causing it.,0.0,0.887,0.113,0.9331,1,1

I've done some substantial undervolting to try and fix the problem and although it has helped it still heats up - have done expanded searches on google forums etc. for possible solutions. It's in particular when it's charging that it really overheats before I undervolted it it got so hot I could barely touch underneath the laptop where I presume the battery is situated and also on the left by the charger it gets really hot. I can to some extend understand this if I'm using graphical intense games but after all the intensive tweaking I have done using guides to ThrottleStop etc the CPU and GPU temperature still sits between 55-65 when having just one browser window open with one tab. Using Brave and Firefox . Any solutions or recommendations?,0.012,0.914,0.074,0.7935,1,1

1,gmbsz9,Dell,5,2020/05/19 14:28:15,Afternoon,Dell XPS 15 9560 - Fan Noise and Performance Issues Hi Dell! I have had a Dell XPS 15 9560 with an i7-7700HQ 16GB RAM 512GB SSD and non-touch 1080P screen for a few years now. Running Windows 10 Education Version 1909. Early on in my ownership I had issues with fan noise especially when connected to my Dell WD15 dock but was able to resolve those and had been good since then. I'd say that almost always the fans were either off or slow enough that they were inaudible and the laptop would feel cool on my lap. Now again for the last 2 months approx I have constant fan noise and notably lower performance than say 6 months ago. The left side with all the plugs is quite warm to the touch. I am assuming this is due to a driver change Windows update Dell update or similar. My CPU is often clocked down to 1.88GHz in Task Manager which I know can be an energy saving measure but it often doesn't appear to clock back up and the UI/programs will get laggy while CPU usage shows as quite high. EDIT I now see that if I set the Thermal to Optimized or Ultra Performance the GHz get back up to 2.5 GHz or so but the fans are putting out a good howl. All I'm doing is having a few Chrome tabs open reading a Word doc Spotify Slack. CPU load 20%. Any pointers on where to start? I've blown out the fans with cans of compressed air and got some good dust puffs out. Haven't opened it or anything more drastic. Using Dell Command Power Manager's Thermal Management setting to Quiet is still audible yet more fan noise than usual and anything else sounds like the laptop is under a good load even if there are just a couple programs open but no real work being done. Secondary Issue /another symptom? this has been happening nearly the entire time I have had the laptop but about 4-6 times per day everything on the laptop will freeze . Moving the trackpad mouse attached to the dock laptop or docked keyboard has no effect. All programs freeze. I think sound usually stops too? Resolves itself always within 5-10 seconds. Third Issue Probably unrelated but might as well ask all at once. I'm stuck at home now and the laptop lives lid open on a stand with my dock external monitor but when I was on campus the laptop would continue to run after the lid was closed . This meant that every time I would want to move locations I would have to sleep the laptop with the power button wait 15 seconds for the lights to go out then close the lid. Otherwise around half the time it would continue to run in the laptop slot of my backpack sometimes overnight and would just bake itself in there P.S. does DellCares respond to chat messages or just PMs? P.P.S I've been having performance issues when gaming as well. See this post from a few weeks ago Hoping that resolving these low load thermal noise issues will carry over to getting a better gaming experience as well.,0.027,0.849,0.123,0.9944,1,1

I'm planning on upgrading the ram around the time I get the laptop but I would also like to upgrade the battery to the larger 86 wh capacity by buying a replacement battery later on if they become available and doing the upgrade myself. I wanted to put out feelers to see if people think a battery upgrade to the larger capacity would be possible and if it seems likely that Dell will make the 86 wh battery available to purchase as a replacement part? From looking online and checking out youtube videos it seems like it'll be a plug-and-play situation where the battery just makes the laptop half a pound heavier but i'm not sure.

I've gone through all of the troubleshooting options that were suggested on all of the threads concerning the issue on the dell support messageboards. Like many of the others experiencing the same issue the display works in safe mode and works with an external monitor. It also works if I disable the 540 display driver in device manager but then lacking many features . I tried disconnecting the battery and holding the power button to no avail. I ended up doing a clean format/install via a USB stick with the Dell SupportOS software installed the display worked until about halfway through the process then I had to use an external monitor again . From there I've updated the BIOS and all of the chipset drivers. I attempted to install the latest display driver on the Dell support website for the XPS 130 9350 -- upon my first attempt to install the computer rebooted unexpectedly. Upon my second attempt it provided me with an error message saying it was not compatible with my operating system. This laptop was very expensive. It's only a couple of years old and has been meticulously taken care of. I tried searching through other threads for a solution and I've contacted Dell support several times with no luck.

Hello I was wondering if someone would be able to help. I have a Dell XPS13 9370 and I keep getting BSOD with error “whea uncorrectable error”. I’ve run the Dell Boot Diagnostic the Dell Online Diagnostic Prime95 Memtest86 Crystal disk info Intel Processor Diagnostic Windows Memory Diagnostic System File Checker and a bunch of performance benchmark/stress tests. Nothing comes up and then I’ll get the BSOD randomly when the system is idle. I tried loading Ubuntu 20.04 and the system is stable when I’m using it however if I leave the lid up lock the screen and the system goes into suspend the computer fails to boot back up and I get a two amber one white code on the LED which means CPU failure. If I lock the screen close the lid and the system suspends when I open the lid the system resumes with no issue so I’m at a loss as to what the issue is. I read that there might be an issue with the real time clock and I tried to reset it holding the power button 30s but nothing happens. I was hoping someone would be able to help. Update left the lid open while it did an update and it shut off and 2 Amber and 1 one white on LED. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Thanks,0.153,0.794,0.052,-0.9787,-1,0

However I also plan to buy a nice 4K monitor and I was eyeing the ultrasharps.

Is it ok to have multiple power supplies plugged in? Will the monitor's power be ignored?

Therefore i used Throttlestop to know reason why fps drops and i learnt that Power Limit Throttling causes to reduce clock speed of CPU. I tried to remove DPTF from device manager. It worked but i don't want to use this solution because removing DPTF can cause other issues am i right ?

Bought a laptop cooler so the back plate does not get hot from the thermal pads transferring heat. 7. Clean the heat sink regularly to make sure it has no dust. 8. Set fan mode to ultra performance.

It still crashes like no tomorrow. Every other day is a crash. Some days I can use it for gaming for hours on end but today it crashes 5 minutes into a game. MSI afterburner also says the temps for CPU and GPU are pegged at 74C so not overly hot. Yes I know 74C is the max for GPU so it throttles .

11,glt1wi,Dell,1,2020/05/18 18:44:38,Afternoon,Dell g3 3590 Hinge issue is my nightmare Hey i want to share with you how a dell G3 15 3590 laptop that i bought became a nightmare. Its been 3 months since this nightmare started. Before i start i live in Tunisia where the dell support is limited and they do not have direct support in my region anyway Fall 2019 i decided to buy a gaming laptop for studying/working/gaming purposes and im in computer science class. Since i trust DELL i went for the G3 3590. I was super happy with it and its been just sitting in the desk and ive been taking a very good care of it like keeping the dust away. but a month later i started noticing a tik sound that comes out of the right hinge when i open the laptop lid. So i discussed with DELL Support about this. They recommended me to take the laptop to their service partner which is 125KM away from where i live. So i decided to delay that for next month. A few days later that hinge just popped out when i closed the laptop. I immediately contacted dell support showed them pictures about the hinge that popped out and they again recommended me to take it to service partner and was told it could be covered under warranty. Thats what i did i cancelled my next week plans and took the PC to the service partner. I showed them the issue and they took the g3 for repairs under warranty. Thats what they said . First i was happy about that but it was the beginning of the nightmare. I travelled home. 3 Weeks i did not get any information everytime i call them they dont respond. So i decided to talk with dell support again. Ive been politely reaching them so they contacted the center and a day later i got a respond that repair pieces are not in stock I checked the internet and found out that so many people started having the same exact issue about the hinge and it is definitely a design flaw. Now its been more than a month i finally got an email but it was just bad news. They said that the damage was physical will not covered under warranty and lid should be changed which costs around 920DT 350 thats like 30% the laptop's price. They told me to confirm the repairs i should pay 50% of it first. I replied to the email that i cannot confirm repairs. Contacted dell support about this but this time that was useless all they said was same thing . Physical damage cannot be covered under warranty. HOW IS THAT NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY IF ITS THEIR FAULT TO PRODUCE A DESIGN FLAWED LAPTOP THAT WILL BREAK ITSELF ????? Anyway i was hopeless i decided to take the laptop back but due to the Covid pandamic the country was in lockdown. I checked the service events about my laptop and found out that their incompetent service partner started a dispatch without my authorization/ confirmation. I tried to contact them again they dont respond to phone calls I contacted Dell Support they couldnt help and the only information they gave is when the laptop will be ready for pickup. At that point i was really confused and this gave lots more anxiety than before because i didnt even know what happened and why the repairs started without confirmation and dont even know if im gonna pay for that or not . I checked the internet and more people just had the same issue and most of them got it repaired under warranty. I called DELL Tunisia to address this and they said that this should be under warranty since its common but they couldnt reach the service partner. At the beginning of May i received an SMS that the laptop was ready for pickup and got more confused because the sms didnt give information if i should pay or not many times i try to call them 5 times each day they dont respond. Yes right again i contacted DELL support again they told me the repairs was not under warranty and like always they forward me to contact their uncontactable incompetent service partner for further information ? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ? Until now the PC is still at their service center and theyre expecting me to pay them something i cannot afford and i did not cause. I have no idea what to do so im posting this to the community I dont know if i will trust DELL again after damaging me mentally and giving me lots of stress and anxiety for 3 months for something that is not resolved yet. Also im in computer science class without a computer and i have national exams next month so i need the laptop back ASAP. Also DELL should be responsible for their service partner since they recommended me to take it to them. What i hated most is how they keep forwarding me to contact them but they dont respond to any phone calls. Also DELL was not who decided if pc is under warranty or not it was their service partner who did. Im not paying any money for the repairs i should get it for free because its a design flaw. Thanks for reading this and i will post any updates.,0.087,0.815,0.098,0.8027,1,1

I reached out to Dell Germany and Dell Netherlands via their chat since there is no customer sales chat on Dell Belgium website. Dell Germany gave me a discount but they only deliver to Germany. I have two questions Is it possible to get a discount on the new Dell XPS 15?

Sometime ago I started having heavy fps drops in games and when I checked in XTU it was a power limit throttling when I searched online users told me it was the laptop overheating so I cleaned the dust and undervolted it the heat got better but I still get the fps drops. When I bought the laptop 2 years ago brand new it came with a 130w power supply but today I read the laptop power specs and knew that it supports up to 180w so is the 130w adapter causing this throttling if yes should I get a 180w adapter and why in the first place did it come with a 130 one ?,0.0,0.931,0.069,0.8294,1,1

After 8 months of using it I started experiencing overheating. So I underclocked gpu cpu and tried many more things but couldn't fix it. So I had it repasted I didn't see thier work . At first temps were fine. But after 1 week or so overheating started again and this time it's even worse. Whole laptop is crazy hot even the plastic guards. Because of the pandemic I can't even hand it to a shop for repair. So my conclusion is that I think the shop I gave it for repasting did something wrong or didn't do it properly. So I need a temporary solution to overcome overheating as I have to work online for living🙂 Sorry for the paragraph. Someone plz try to help me. Thanks,0.1,0.801,0.099,-0.2608,-1,0

Previously I was a bit annoyed by the fan sound of the machine not only myself but also my family. I wanted it to be quieter even sacrifice performance to some degree. I tried tweaking throttlestop and also disabled Turbo boost but didn't control the noice as I expected until I switched the thermal mode to Quiet in Dell Power Manager tool. What amazed me is not only the fan sound which is so quiet even during games but also the performance. I played Battlefield 5 for 2-3 hours and got very mild noise and fps between 55 - 60 during most of the time in Ultra setting! I just can't believe it. The GPU frequency was around 1300MHz - 1500MHz and CPU around 2.7GHz. Both temperatures were around 65-70C. I didn't feel the heat on the keyboard. I didn't undervolt GPU while undervolted -140 in CPU and cap the TDP to 30. But in Optimize mode in power manager the temperature was around 70 - 80C and the fan was noisy. I'm going to use Quiet mode most of the time with this laptop.,0.035,0.849,0.116,0.9526,1,1

Disable SmartByte for an instant fix Just bought an Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 and I have been getting terrible internet speeds. As I type this I'm sitting 3 feet from my router and while every other device on my network can get 120Mbps down - my laptop was getting 10 at best. After uninstalling and reinstalling wifi drivers a dozen reboots looking at MiMo power settings and every other Google result I could find... someone in the Dell forums mentioned SmartByte. What is SmartByte? It's designed to throttle all non-video streaming traffic so your Netflix doesn't slow down while you're downloading something else. Mine was set to throttle my connection to 10Mbps down. I disabled it did a speed test and INSTANTLY got my 120Mbps connection I would expect. I uninstalled it then uninstalled the SmartByte drivers and services app. To do that I had to disable the Rivet Dynamic Bandwidth service and then reboot.

I've been encountering some sort of random stutters/freezes when the laptop is NOT heavy-loaded i.e. zooming typing or watching YouTube and that's it . Usually each stutter takes about 2-3 sec or 5-7 sec and the laptop would resume normally and anything I typed would show up on screen as well. During the stutter nothing would work the laptop simply freezes up. Stutters can happen a few times in an hour or nothing in a few hours. I had tried almost every solution posted in this thread but seriously nothing worked. However I haven't tried reinstalling the OS or moving the OS to another SSD. I reserve these as my final solutions and will do them after I finish my school in June. Oh and I did try using the Dell diagnostic tools but it reported no problems in CPU SSD and memories.

I‘d been waiting for the new XPS 15 for months and when finally it came out I saw the European/Italian prices and I got less enthusiast than I was before... My intention was to buy the new XPS 15 with UHD display 16 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD . Unfortunately this configuration isn’t still possible in my country but I’ve read it will be in next weeks I hope rumours are true . Apart of it being an university student I know I can use the student coupon code to have a 10% discount on XPS. This is good. But starting from the actual 2599€ even with a 10% discount we are over 2300€. My idea was to stay around 2000/2100€ so since I’ve read that in June/July there will be Dell’s sales I decided to wait this period. But now there’s another problem I noticed in old XPS 15 that I can’t use student coupon and Dell’s sale coupon i.e. SAVING12 together. If I use the first then when I add the second the first got replaced by the second they don’t get merged! Is there some way to use both together or have I to decide what of them to use? If so the student coupon doesn’t make any sense since I won’t buy XPS every day... EDIT since I understood there is actually no way to use both coupons of above I ask you if avoiding 4K display and go to the FHD is a good manner to save money without losing quality.

Could be the game Fallout 4 but it's 50/50 lol. Can anyone confirm the heat cap? Also has anyone had it repasted? Maybe added liquid metal ala Linus Tech tips?

Hello almighty redditors I'm looking for a laptop to buy and since I'm interested in digital art and I can't afford both a drawing tablet and a good laptop i thought I might look into some 2 in 1 laptops that I might use for drawing. As a dell enthusiast I was thinking of Dell 2 in 1 XPS 15 and recently I found out about HP spectre X360 and the surface book pro. Most probably I won't get it now but what do you think is the best laptop for a student who is into digital drawing and some light gaming maybe minecraft and ARMA 3? . And is it worth it to buy a 2 in 1 laptop for drawing? I will use it as a laptop too to study but i didn't see any youtuber talking about dell 2 in 1 xps 15 as a digital tablet parallel to wacom tablets for example.

Slightly prefer Windows to Mac but that doesn't hold a lot of weight- like iMessage and Facetime but the same applies.

It used to work fine until a weeks ago when it started to drop periodically down to 5-10 fps for a few seconds and then going up again to 45 . This has gotten more frequent and by now its basically a few seconds low fps going up for a few seconds and then down again. E.g. I was able to play Fallout 4 or Witcher 3 just fine on High/Ultra settings with 45-60 fps. By now it is unplayable.

I have tried changing thermal option in alienware command center without much luck. If I set it to performance and power plan to performance then it reaches 75 degrees while idle. I found what keeps it lowest is the dell power plan with the cool thermal option. Is there any reason it's getting so hot or any way I can configure so it does not get so hot? I don't care about noise the fans can be running full blast during usage it does not effect me. I just do not like it getting so hot as it's too hot to even touch the keyboard after it's been on for 2 hours.

I’ve tried going to updates and recovery and resetting this pc and wiping the disk but it doesn’t work. What I mean by that is when it boots up again it goes through the secondary keyboard and all that but I think it’s because it asks me for my Microsoft account is what keeps recognizing that my profile is still on the computer. It doesn’t have support assist installed the Alienware support isn’t there a message pops up sayin that GeForce isn’t installed and it automatically has my background I had before I cleaned it.

Nothing I have tried seems to help - I uninstalled some programs I thought were causing the issue I did a clean install of Windows 10 I made sure all drivers were updated with zero success. I can’t rely on the laptop to run for any length of time.

Most of the time it crashes to a black screen with the power still on but sometimes the screen will freeze. The only way to get out of it is to manually power down and reboot. Dell hasn’t been particularly helpful - I spent an hour on the phone with them updating drivers firmware and the BIOS only for it to crash again literally as soon as I hung up the phone. I emailed them back only for them to remind me that “freezing issues are not covered by the warranty.” I bought this thing so I could start working a couple days a week from home I’m in healthcare and now it looks like I won’t be able to do that so I’m livid.

I've updated it to Ubuntu 20.04 and I'm not sure if this happens out of the box. When sound would plays for the first time after a while about 4 seconds the screen turns off for about 1.5 seconds then the screen turns back on and the sound plays. This happens 100% consistently. If I reload the sound driver with power save turned off pkill pulseaudio sudo modprobe -r snd hda intel modprobe snd hda intel power save 0 then the screen blinks a couple of times while things are reloaded and thereafter it doesn't turn the screen off anymore. It seems like this is related to waking the audio chip from sleep - something about that process causes the screen to blink. Maybe there's some issue with power management and some chip related to the display browns out and has to reset. There are no errors that show up in dmesg Xorg.0.log or /valog/messages. Haven't been able to get any more information about what's going on with the display. Has anyone else experienced this? If you have do you know if it's specific to 20.04? I'd rather not re-image back to stock if I don't have to. EDIT Okay the screen just did the same thing without any audio playing while I have the audio driver loaded with power save 0. Must be some other way to trigger it too. EDIT2 Determined that the other trigger is preview videos starting to play on Reddit. Without audio so I'm not sure why. Preview videos on Youtube do not trigger it but starting to play a video in Youtube does. EDIT3 Must be something weird about how web browsers are accessing the card.

Hey all I've been searching for a two in one device for a while now and am interested in the XPS 13 2 in 1. There are a few things that hold me back though specifically the complaints about the heat of the device and fan noise. Is this such a prevalent issue that should keep me from buying it or is it a bit exaggerated. Is this a device that i'd be satisfied with for normal use Microsoft applications browsing media consumption and some coding .,0.043,0.875,0.082,0.5719,1,1

After roughly 40 minutes I returned to my asleep laptop and noticed it was too hot to comfortably type on. Once I woke the laptop the fans turned on at max RPM. The fans were off up until this point.

I didn't have an insane amount of money to spend so I just went with the base model the graphics card and got a decent deal through the dell chat. I get around 7 hours watcing youtube or netflix at low brightness and when I play any games I just have it plugged in. I just had a few questions about the smaller battery for the future 1. I know that eventually I will have to replace the battery I plan to use this laptop for the next 4 years through college and I'd image I would replace it at around the 3rd year of owning it . Will I be able to swap out the 56whr and replace it with the bigger 97 whr? I know with the smaller battery there is some sort of extra drive bay or ssd slot Idk which but does this be in the way of the bigger battery? 2. Regardless of whether I am able to get the bigger battery or not will I be able to purchase a replacement 7590 battery from dell either 56 or 97 whr? I really would hate to have to use a third party battery as I've heard that some aren't good quality and have destroyed the motherboards of laptops. Has anyone with an older xps or any old dell machine where they replaced the battery by purchasing one from dell or what was your experience doing so?,0.062,0.895,0.042,-0.8078,-1,0

I decided if I could return my device I would just buy the r2 with the money... So return policy was 30 days from shipment which was on the 18 or 19th I cannot figure out which date it was because UPS says the 19th but the label says it was created on the 17th. I cannot figure out if I can still return this. I already completed an online return request and was emailed a shipping label but the CRA I haven't seen as of yet.

The problem I'm having is text looks blurry even at native resolution. First I thought it's because I'm used to a much higher DPI. But the refresh at native resolution is also greyed out at 59.88 NTSC under System Preferences - Displays. I can change it to a 60hz if I switch to a lower resolution. If I google I find several posts complaining how Mac's sometimes recognize Dell monitors as TV's and force YPbPr instead of RGB. But under System Report - Graphics/Displays there's no mention of TV and Dell OSD says it's RGB. Is this how it's supposed to be?

If I turn it on with the adapter plugged in and then remove it everything works fine. Original battery doesn't have this behaviour.

This time they told me that they cannot do anything about the problem as the driver has not been fixed and will never be fixed.

Ever since a few months within getting it it's been a long hard-fought war with thermal throttling issues and battery life. I've been fighting it by opening the chassis and unplugging the battery. This would give me good performance only for a few days. After a while using editing software or even having multiple google Chrome windows open would result in an excrutiatingly laggy experience. I've even replaced the battery but didn't get any significant improvements in battery life. Essentially this laptop must be plugged in at all times and as a college student that edits films this has been unsustainable. Also the fan is basically firing at full speed at all times now. At this point I wonder if should bother trying to under vault the CPU and GPU get the newly announced XPS 17 with better thermal management or just migrate to a new system entirely Macbook Pro .

But if I take out the HDMI cable the Samsung goes dark . Because of where the Optiplex is located next to TV it is not practical for me to have two displays connected to it all the time. I'm looking for a solution where I can get it to work with either no 2nd screen or somehow tricking the Optiplex to think there is a second screen. It seems that somehow the signal that comes out of the Displayport changes in to something the Samsung cannot recognize when there is only one screen connected. I was in contact with Intel customer support Intel i5-6500T with HD530 they checked that all the drivers were up to date and their guess what that the problem must be either BIOS corruption or that the manufacturer designed it this way. Does anyone know a solution to this? I'm about to try installing Linux to see if that makes any difference. Thank you! Edit.

My current laptop is yoga 720 15 and I've never owned a 13inch device before. I have a GTX 1070 external GPU and a monitor so the GPU in the XPS 15 isn't much of a deciding factor. My main problem is that 1. I don't know if I would enjoy a 13-inch laptop more than 15 or if I would miss the big screen after the honeymoon period. 2. I plan on doing some video editing but not sure if the 13inch EGPU would be able to handle it or if I should get the H processors for future-proofing. if I get the 15inch XPS I can sell my EGPU so effectively the price is about the same. However I'm going to probably get the 4k screen with the 15inch instead of full HD touch with the 13.,0.044,0.908,0.047,0.5297,1,1

I use this laptop for heavy video editing and for resource-intensive games. Operating System Windows 10 Pro 64-bit 10.0 Build 18363 18362.19h1 release.190318-1202 System Manufacturer Dell Inc. System Model XPS 15 9570 BIOS 1.15.0 type UEFI Processor Intel R Core TM i9-8950HK CPU 2.90GHz 12 CPUs 2.9GHz Card name Intel R UHD Graphics 630 Card name NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti with Max-Q Design x200B At seemingly random times dwm.exe and sometimes csrss.exe will display 40% to 100% usage on the Intel GPU. While this is occurring the computer will completely freeze. I'm confused as to what can cause this issue. All of the other components display normal usage levels but the GPU spontaneously gets swamped by these processes. This error is easily reproduced while playing games and occasionally happens while doing mundane tasks like browsing the internet. Note that the problem occurs on the integrated GPU while the Nvidia GPU is being utilized by a separate program. I also have a second display connected through HDMI. I do not know how long this has been going on until I discovered activity from dwm.exe I assumed my laptop had common thermal throttling issues. Any ideas as to what could be the source of this activity? Thank you.

2,gkfenm,Dell,0,2020/05/16 11:10:22,Morning,SOLVED Auto Screen Dimming Adaptive Brightness disable on Inspiron Laptops If you have sensitive eyes you might have noticed that the laptop screen 'dims' when 'bright' windows are displayed on the screen. It appears that this has to do with some Intel 'automatic' power management Adaptive Brightness that somehow believes that just because more pixels are 'white' that somehow corresponds to a need to envoke some power saving in the backlight LEDs. There does not seem to be a way to disable this 'feature' in Windows or the Intel driver. See this post I was reviewing my BIOS settings and I saw a strange setting for the Video submenu Dynamic Backlight Control Enable or disable the dynamic backlight control. Page 72 of 80 here I believe this is the key to permanently fixing the issue - simply disable the feature in BIOS. I have not taken the time to see if re-enabling it in the Intel display driver will work. Once again it comes down to RTFM ,0.011,0.911,0.079,0.8868,1,1

I'm just sharing two different experiences I had with Dell Support and HP Support in France 🇨🇵. I hope you'll have better luck than me with your computer and local support. So basically I own an XPS 13 9370 top specs 2k€ and my girlfriend owns a HP Spectre 13 2019 top specs 1.8k€ . These devices have similar specs and were the best of the highend ultrabooks that Dell and HP sold by this time. We are both happy with our laptops. I'm not mentionning the price of these PC to show by balls but just to have context for the following. More than a year ago my powerbrick died during premium support period . Same thing append for my gf few days ago. Here's how both premium supports managed our problems HP Me Hello my PSU died HP I'm sorry. You have premium support I'm ordering a new charger right now you will receive it in 2 to 3 days. Total phone call duration less than 5 minutes litteraly Dell Me Hello my PSU died Dell Ok np just let me check few things with you it will be very quick. Dell also Ok give me access to your computer with support assist lol I bought my XPS with Ubuntu hopefully I already installed Win10 plug and unplug your charger 5 times from your laptop and the power outlet do the same thing in BIOS and again in testing mode. Me after 30min of tests Bro please I have work to do can't you just send me a new PSU ? Total phone call duration 45 minutes and it could have been longer if I didn't say stop. I think Dell in Europe have a lot of thing to learn in Premium Support . I'm just sharing this particular experience because I can compare this exact same situation with HP but I also get a lot of problems with Dell Support on my XPS and high end servers in my company I'm sysadmin . That's very sad because the only laptop that I feel like better than mine is the new XPS 13.

My XPS was prone to overheating and a couple months back did some repasting and adding thermal pads to the vrms a couple of days ago I noticed one of the pads had moved and was blocking the fan flow and this was visible from under the laptop. Last night as I was removing the back cover a loose metal component was moved and touched something on the motherboard which resulted in sparks. The laptop turns on but after 30 seconds shows two Amber followed by white led indicating cpu failure. There is visible damage link to images at the bottom. The laptop was purchased off eBay and dell have said that they can't provide support as the previous owner was meant to send it back to dell and the laptop is on hold or something. They said the only solution would be to contact the previous owner and get him to send it back which is just stupid really. Not feasible at all. My question is whats the solution here? I'm guessing the motherboard has to be replaced but I'm hoping there's a cheaper solution. I'm a student so I'm strapped for money and a new motherboard is approx 500. Also there's coursework on the internal drive and I'm wondering if the data is recoverable at all. Any advice or help is appreciated! ,0.093,0.822,0.085,-0.2799,-1,0

However yesterday one of the keys would tilt to the side and kind of get stuck. I took apart the key to see what was wrong and part of the little plastic hinge had cracked. I was really annoyed and frustrated but figured I could just get a new key and I wouldn't mind spending the few bucks for it. Except you can't get keys for the XPS 13 9300. Dell doesn't sell em and no third parties sell em. After digging through dells website and not really being able to find a good way to reach them I decided to message their Twitter support account and yes I made sure it was the official one. A minute later someone got back to me. And guess what I have to ship the laptop back to sell for repairs. But the crazier thing is that the entire keyboard has to be replaced. They can't simply pop in a new key. Oh well wish me luck.,0.066,0.785,0.149,0.9655,1,1

Issue The computer has been running a bit hot via CoreTemp and Intel Extreme Tuning Utility 80-100C. Sometimes it will just restart. Sometimes a program will freeze then when opening task manager it will not open up and will not restart without a hard shut down. The fans are not spinning fast seemingly ever anymore. I had this problem when I first got it but it's been running fine for about a year now until this. After a clean install all drivers are up to date via windows update and support assist. I re thermal pasted no change looked fine. Fans and sinks are clean. It doesn't matter if there is a fanned laptop stand under it. It doesn't seem to matter what Dell Power setting is being used nor Windows Power setting. I've heard undervolting spelling can help but the option is greyed out I do not see any current help on this topic especially not with the undervolting missing. I'm out of ideas.

Called the bank and straightened it out then called Dell to finish the purchase. Or at least attempt to. You'd think businesses would make it easy for you to drop 3 grand with them. Nope. So far my experience included 78 minute hold times only to be transferred to someone who claims to be a Dell operator who connects me to another employee who claims to be an operator. I When I did finally get an employee to help they started doing shady things changing the order number and using high pressure sales techniques. Then they get upset I didn't want to finance it and would not take no for an answer. I've been a long time Mac user and it took a long time for me to try alienware.

From the get-go I've realised that the laptop easily gets very hot to the touch within a couple of minutes of turning it on I also realised that the fans were constantly loud even after I'd changed the fans to be quiet. 3 days after I had started using my new laptop I was streaming Netflix and the whole laptop froze I couldn't turn it off I couldn't move the mouse cursor or anything - it was useless. To solve this problem I had to let the battery die. I've contacted Dell support and the 2 people I spoke to over the phone said these were common problems with the model I own. Is this normal? Is anybody else having these issues? Can somebody try and recommend some solutions to these problems?

My first experiences with this laptop were that it ran really hot on games like GTA V 90 to 100C and it was frustrating me. I then decided to under volt the laptop and also disabled turbo boost and that has been the best decision ever for me. Who knew gaming on just 2.6 GHz would still be smooth as hell with Ultra graphics on GTA V. Temperatures sit around 60-70C while gaming for hours on end.

I am kind of new to all of this and have been looking into undervolting so I can get better thermals while playing less-demanding games mainly right now apex and gta v. I tested apex with no undervolt with settings at minimum and a capped frame rate at 60 but was getting temperatures of a maximum of 99 degrees much too hot for my liking. I tried using XTU to undervolt but on the version of the bios I have I guess that it is blocked. I just downloaded throttlestop and it let me play with the undervolt values but is it actually undervolting the cpu or is it still blocked like XTU? I'm on bios 1.6.0 and if it allows me to undervolt on throttlestop what value should I offset it by considering that I have the lower-core i5. Thanks for the help!,0.039,0.802,0.159,0.9687,1,1

I've bought some brand new Samsung PM1643 1TB SAS SSDs for my Dell PowerEdge R510 Server with a PERC H700 RAID Controller. Unfortunately they don't work and I don't know why. When I insert a SSD the Power LED goes up and the activity LED starts blinking indefinitely. During that blinking all other installed drives stop blinking and the host system freezes. When I pull the SSD everything goes back to normal. The host works again and the other drives are blinking again. So I assume that the SAS-Bus is blocked when I insert the SSD. I tested the drives also in a Dell Poweredge T310 with a PERC H200a controller. Here the Controller recognizes the SSDs but instantly marks them as failed makes them unusable. The firmwares on the controllers are the latest. Does someone knows why this is happening or what can I do about it? FYI I work as a System Administrator and this is my private home server I use as my homelab. Other 3rd-Party-SSDs like Samsung 860 Pro are working fine. Only the PM1643 won't work.

I'm having an issue with what I suspect to be thermal throttling. I've been gaming on this laptop for over 2 years without any issues getting constant 60fps at games ranging from The Witcher 3 to GTAV but recently it's been getting REALLY hot and I'll get random drops in frame rate often enough to make the games unplayable especially in busy scenes with a number of characters interacting . I even took the laptop apart and applied thermal paste and to clean out any dust that I might have accumulated there was hardly but that has yielded no improvements or at least nothing that I can notice . At this very moment when I feel just above the keyboard I can tell it's somewhat hot HW Monitor tells me CPU temp is at around 60 across all cores and GPU temp is at 55 at 0% utilization even though I just have a few tabs on Chrome open and a few background apps which I've always had. My drivers are updated to 445.87. I even tried a hotfix driver 445.98 but that also did nothing to improve the situation. These are the specs Intel Core i5-7300HQ 2.5Ghz GTX 1060 Max-Q 16GB of RAM Windows 10 Home I'm no expert at computer hardware so please let me know if you require more info .

The trackpad is great and the keyboard is almost as good as my ThinkPad. x200B 2 weeks ago I ordered an XPS 13 for about 1500 arrived a few days later there was a stuck pixel that was only really visible in certain conditions annoying but I get why something like this would pass QC. There was also a tonne of coil whine but I didn't report this as a fault. I get in contact with Dell I'm offered a full refund or an engineer out to fix it. When I requested an exchange I was told that wasn't an option. I spent over an hour on the phone before requesting a call back from a supervisor which I hate doing . The supervisor offered me an exchange which was great. x200B A week later the new unit arrives everything seems fine but I notice what looks like a bit of grit or a chip in the palm rest coating...it was small but on a 1500 premium device? Damn. This unit also suffered from coil whine when fully charged that got noticeably worse when scrolling around. I contacted support again I didn't want to go through the whole getting a supervisor thing and I was tired of copy and pasted responses via email so I accepted a repair for the palm rest and asked that the engineer bring another motherboard so he/she can decide if the coil whine was within spec it was possible I just noticed it more because the fans are rarely running . The following day I notice another stuck pixel again only visible in certain conditions but what the hell? I wasn't about to have half the laptop replaced when it was 48 hours old. x200B After 2 weeks of faulty machines I'm done I'd rather have a thicker machine that doesn't give me a constant headache of faults.,0.159,0.758,0.084,-0.9838,-1,0

Today I was running a game when everything started running at a snail's pace and the whole thing crashed. Whenever I turned on the PC I would get a blue screen saying that something went wrong and my computer needed to restart. This happened a few times before it turned on with a white screen this time with a new message saying that the AC adapter type could not be verified and that the battery may not charge. This happened a few times never letting me start the computer any further until I decided to run the diagnostic which allowed me into the computer. I thought this was the end of it but I noticed that the charge of the battery was at 9% not moving up nor down. It just said plugged in and didn't show how much time till fully chsrged. I downloaded an app and verified that the battery was not charging. So I restarted the computer got the message about the AC adapter again so I tried a few other power cables all resulting in the same message. I ran the diagnostics and checked the battery section this time. It showed that the battery health was excellent it showed the battery's voltage and displayed that it currently had 7% power left. At the bottom next to AC Adapter it said Unknown. I've tried unplugging the battery which is built-in to the system by the way and starting the computer but I still get the message and after plugging it in again and starting the computer nothing changes.

I decided to reach out to the Dell support team. I simply asked if there was anything they can do to expedite my order using please and thank you just like my Mom taught me. Dell support was quick to respond saying they had made a request to expedite the order and would keep me up to date. I allowed another few days to pass as one day seems to blend into the next in this weird time. I replied to their email thanking them for the effort. I got another email back this week from support. It has been the same person I spoke with through the entire email thread. She updated me saying the laptop will likely ship on our before May 18. She also noted an additional 75 credit will be applied to my order!! 👍🙂🙃. So with nothing more than a few kind words in a few emails I was able to have saved myself 75!

I was about to buy the XPS 15 7590 brand new for uni but as the 2020 version has just been released I'm a bit sceptical that the 7590's price hasn't been reduced at all I'd hate to pay 1500 just to see the price slashed after a month or so. x200B Additionally is it worth trying to save money and buying a refurbished laptop from the Dell Outlet? My primary concerns with this were that a majority of the laptops had 8th gen processors I want to get one that's fairly recent 9th gen or better so that it can keep up with my needs for a few years and not have to worry about 'wear and tear' for a while . My other concern was that if the previous user was careless with the laptop not in a cosmetic way but in a less obvious way like causing it to over heat those issues will begin to surface a while after the purchase having an impact on the laptops life span. x200B Any advice / input is greatly appreciated thanks.,0.066,0.804,0.13,0.9375,1,1

My XPS CPU i7-7700HQ and NVIDIA GPU GTX 1050 don't seem to be distributing workloads quite right. I play a fair amount of video games Rocket League and CSGO and every now and then my frames drop to practically zero from 70. And it will hold that way for 10 seconds or so until things seem to settle. When I open up system processes I notice that my Integrated Graphics usage seems to be at 100% while my GPU usage is at 20%. And the only time my GTX 1050 seems to be doing anything is in games. I went into NVIDIA's control panel and set preferred graphics card for everything as my GTX 1050 yet my 1050 seems to be doing no work at all unless im in a game. Even when watching youtube videos my integrated graphics card is doing all the work and my GPU is supposedly doing nothing. And I mean nothing. Control panel says 0%. Anyone else had this problem? Do I have a dead/dying chip? Things to note I am hooked up to an external monitor via HDMI I noticed that the HDMI port is connected to my integrated graphics card not my GTX 1050. Figured the integrated graphics card would just operate as a pass-thru... .

Kinda disappointed that this has happened after only a few months' gentle use around the house. It started out by a mechanical separation of the toggle holding it in Since then the adhesive holding the strip in place has started to fail across the rear strip. Now just a few days after this started I'm left with gross dangling rubber grips I'm guessing the right adhesive could help fix this but I'm not sure which one to use. Or I could just completely detach the strip. Any advice on what to do? Edit I used some loctite super glue to put the grip back on. It looks kinda shit but it's on the bottom of the laptop so ツ / ,0.096,0.846,0.058,-0.6258,-1,0

2,gjtbxw,Dell,4,2020/05/15 11:35:58,Morning,Calling All Dell XPS 13 9350/9360 Owners! Hey Everyone A good friend of mine is looking to sell his XPS 13 9350 model to me for cheap. I believe the specs are Intel Skylake i5 Processor 512GB SSD and 8GB of Ram. I know he takes super good care of all his electronics computers and last time I saw him with the machine it seemed cosmetically in good shape. He is looking to upgrade to a newer Dell XPS and is willing to sell it to me for pretty cheap. Question I believe the 9350 came out in 2016 so that would make most of them around 4 years old currently. So my question is for those out there with an XPS 9350 and we will throw in 9360 owners as well how are your machines holding up after 3-4 years of use so far? Would you recommend it a good buy? My Use-Case I'm an IT Admin so this machine isn't going to be doing any type of super heavy workoad stuff. More general web stuff surfing email music and maybe some light coding Linux stuff heard Manjaro works good on these models when I'm on the go and need a good portable ultrabook. Anyone with any thoughts / feedback if this would be a good buy or not? Thanks in advance to everyone for your time and help it is greatly appreciated.,0.009,0.799,0.192,0.9928,1,1

Also I mentioned the price difference compared to the US and I'd just like for you all to be insistent on getting a good price as they can definitely go close to the US prices.

3,gjnjf4,Dell,9,2020/05/15 06:36:30,Night,Dell XPS 15 2020 with 56Whr battery? The new XPS 15 has been announced and it is already available on the European store. While looking at the specs I had noticed that the cheap variant which is sold for about 1699€ of the model has a 3-cell battery 56Whr. IMO this is quite small especially if you look at the xps 2019 which had a 97Whr for all variants. But I'm also not willing to pay an extra 400€ for the model with 86Whr it also has a dedicated GPU which I don't really need...the integrated intel graphics card of the cheaper model is just fine . So I need to ask how much is the expected battery life for the 3-cell 56Whr battery? Is it worth it to spend 1699€ for such machine? I would like to be able to bring the laptop around with me without constantly being forced to bring also the charger every time. Keep in mind that I would be using it just as a regular user. No gaming no video editing or cpu intensive programs. But I sometimes use my current machine to watch some youtube in my free time or use google meet skype etc. Any help is appreciated.,0.021,0.871,0.108,0.947,1,1

2,gjqvd8,Dell,7,2020/05/15 09:30:29,Morning,Dell G7 7590 high power draw at idle I have a brand new G7 7590 and I'm trying to figure out if this laptop has a problem or if this is just the design. Some online reviews have indicated an idle battery life of many hours plus a low idle power draw in the 10-20W range. This is what I was expecting based on other i7 Dell laptops I have. But this new beast will never draw less than 45W when plugged in or 30W on battery at idle . Since the battery only has 60 W-h this means the max battery life I can achieve is 1.5-2 hours completely idle. I feel like there's a setting somewhere I'm missing that is the key to get this idle load much lower or there is some component drawing a ton of power. The laptop specs G7 7590 i7-9750H RTX 2060 CPU 32GB RAM 1TB Sata SSD NVMe 500 GB All drivers and BIOS are 100% up to date. I typically run it in Quiet power mode although honestly I haven't seen any difference in idle power draw no matter what I set this mode to I do see a difference when under load however . Similarly setting the power mode to high performance or balanced seems to make no difference at idle. Update 5/18/20 I seem to have found a fix for my high power draw problem. I went into the NVIDIA Control Panel and changed the Preferred Graphics Processor to High-Performance NVIDIA process instead of Auto-select and my idle power draw dropped from 35-45W to 20W while plugged in and 20W while on battery. I have no idea why this matters but in case it can help someone else I'll leave this here. Strangely enough if I lock my computer and the screen turns off the power draw goes back up into the 30's until I log back in. And then it drops back to 20W.,0.055,0.915,0.03,-0.5867,-1,0

1,gju5pf,Dell,5,2020/05/15 12:18:19,Morning,Anyone who has experience with the new XPS 13 models... Hello For anyone who has/had one of the new XPS 13 models I have some questions that I'd like to ask. I previously had an XPS 13 7390 last generation with an i7 and 8GB of RAM 256GB of storage and I was very dissatisfied with it especially for the price point. There were a few things with that model that really irritated me and I'd like to know if they were resolved in the new model. For reference I went through two separate models of the XPS 13 7390 and they both had very similar if not the same issues. The new XPS looks really nice but I don't really trust Dell anymore. Especially since all the reviews I see are filled with overwhelming praise and didn't discuss any of the issues I experienced 1 When the laptop is open to 90 degrees does it tip over from side to side when you press down in the bottom left corner of the bottom panel near the trackpad ? This bugged me a lot especially when typing and I heard absolutely no word about it from anywhere. I had to put a few layers of tape on the bottom just so that it would remain stable. 2 Is the keyboard good? I heard tons of praise about the keyboard before buying but I was very disappointed in it. Although there is a large key travel the keys would very often get stuck and the key wouldn't go completely down. Again very irritating when typing. 3 Is the fingerprint scanner reliable? In my experience it only worked around 50% of the time and I ended up just using a PIN to enter my computer because I'd be spending so much time fiddling with the sensor trying to position my finger in different ways for it to work. 4 Does it take a long time to wake up? I have a nearly 10 year old garbage laptop that wakes up very quickly from being on sleep but the XPS 13 consistently took over 10 seconds to boot up and I'd often have to smash the keys or hit the power button just for it to wake up from sleep and sometimes I'd have to restart it because it wouldn't respond . 5 How is the fan noise? In my experience it got extremely loud notably when charging even under very small loads. Seriously like a jet engine. I tinkered in the BIOS and found a setting to remove it but it compromised the performance of the computer. 6 How is the battery life? Again I heard lots of praise about this in reviews but it didn't meet my expectations at all which I'm not super surprised about because it doesn't have a big battery on paper . I'd have my computer on the lowest brightness setting on battery saver mode and I'd go from 100% to just below 80% in a 75 minute lecture doing nothing more than writing in a google docs document and opening a couple PDFs and so it would barely get me through the day. If you guys have any experience with one of the new XPS 13 models the regular or the 2-in-1 please let me know if you've experienced any similar issues. I would appreciate it a lot!

I’ve checked before buying that TPM chip is there. After updating to latest BIOS 1.11 and installing Windows 10 1909 I found that TPM chip is not working. The error is Storage and TPM not ready . Screenshots here TPM 2.0 TPP in bios so it is a Intel Firmware TMP is there in Device manager but you cannot use it. Dell support said after one and a half hours of investigating and me waiting ”Dell supports only the Operating system shipped with the computer. Anything apart from that our support is limited. TPM bit locker is related to window technology which we will not support as the system was originally shipped with Ubuntu.” Just sharing I’ve lost 2 days to find that there is no fix for this.

It spins for a bit and then seems to show one frame of a 0% complete windows update and then resets and starts all over again. I’m unable to get into windows. My laptop has not been able to do Windows updates for the last 6 months or so. I know my fault for not keeping it up to date. Problem was I would try and the update would always fail and revert back to the same version I was on. I think this is a failed forced windows update that’s messed up my system. I backed up some important files last night because it randomly rebooted to a “repair” mode or something last night that seemed like windows may have been trying to force something but I still have more stuff on there I’d like to retrieve.

I want it to look nice so it came down to these two as I absolutely love the Surface's design and the screen on the XPS is really sexy. I've recently found out that there are differences of hardware though. I'm going for an i5 model and I saw that the Dell has the i5-1035G1 with Intel UHD when the Surface has the i5-1035G7 with Iris Plus. So is the one in the Surface gonna perform better overall with the Iris Plus ? My usage would be - 90% web browsing Word stuff and media consumption - 10% occasionally editing photos and maybe light videos when I'm not home - 1% play some not very demanding games even at low settings x200B So which one should I prioritize ? Is it a real difference between the two ? And does it impact battery life as well ? Thank you guys.,0.024,0.843,0.133,0.957,1,1

Apart from it being a beast with an amazing screen I am having some I believe graphics issues that I haven't been able to resolve. While on a video conference Microsoft Teams mostly the screen starts misbehaving. Scrolling stutters I see white and black parts on the screen faces in the video conference stutter or freeze etc. Audio works fine. Sometimes there's a complete screen freeze frozen app view or desktop so I need to do a hard restart. Sometimes it stutters then continues without any message on the screen - only an error in the Reliability Monitor. When this happens I am receiving a Windows / Hardware Error in the Reliability Monitor. My guess is that Intel Iris drivers provoke this error to happen. I have Dell Command Update installed and have already performed an Advanced Driver Restore. What would you recommend trying next? Anyone with similar issues?

I first looked at some gaming laptops but then decided to scale things down until I found the XPS 15. It looked perfect within my price range dedicated graphics and portable with good battery life. Upon further investigation I found a plethora of problems on the forums and Reddit. Thermal throttling battery expanding and a poor wifi card. However I did also find mixed fixes to the thermal throttling through undervolting and repasting as well as upgrading the wifi card. Then I found out that a BIOS update removed the ability to undervolt?? There were also positive reviews of the XPS 15 confusing me even more. This leads me to my problem that I can’t find another ultraportable with the same performance capability other than the XPS 15. I have seen the latest 2020 model and I’m enticed by the improved cooling and screen however there’s no option with a dedicated graphics card within my budget.

Dell bios returns a fair status for battery health. After 18 months of using the machine I find it to be way too much. I tried calibrating the usual way to no avail but it is my understanding that Lith-ion require another procedure. There is also a strange thing happenig in order to calibrate the battery I set critical charge at 1% in windows 10. Then I entered dell diag mode from the bios in order to drain as much juice as possible. Strangely the laptop held almost an hour while probing such elements as the memory and the UC.

I have a Dell G5 5570 with i7 and 1060 like 18 months ago and right from the start it had issues. I went through two motherboard replacement in six months of usage. Last half year or maybe even more is crazy. I have regurgitate blue screens with different errors and the most scared one is video schedule error. I “repaired” my operation system few times with no results. And the worst thing is performance. Im playing Battlefield 4 which is like 5 or 6 years old and its regularly drop frames with any types of settings. I just want to have some help from support. Thank you. And much love to everyone who read this post. PS. Sorry for English,0.139,0.707,0.153,0.3245,1,1

PROBLEM -battery reads “plugged in” whenever I connect the AC adapter but does not charge at all save one case last observation OBSERVATIONS -I’ve replaced the DC port with no luck -the little white charge light below the touchpad appears shortly when first plugged in but fails to re-light at all after about 2 seconds as it normally would when it charged no flashing or red . -when the battery is dead and I plug the AC adapter in the laptop does not turn on / does then dies instantly as if it’s trying to use the battery -when the battery is unplugged the laptop works alright with just the AC adapter plugged in maybe a little slow -and most oddly of all when I reconnect the battery to the board while the laptop is ON via the AC adapter the battery charges normally and the white light stays on. STILL LEFT TO TRY -bios updates worried about bricking mobo due to weird battery behavior -mainboard replacement 600 -USB C charging best adapter in house is 30W -disconnecting and reconnecting CMOS battery I posted this from my phone in a hurry but I was hoping one of you would be able to help or at least explain what’s causing the last observation planning on ordering USB C adapter tomorrow if no easier ideas Thanks!,0.113,0.773,0.114,0.5357,1,1

32,giq99c,Dell,34,2020/05/13 18:40:41,Afternoon,XPS 15 9570 overheats and not waking up from sleep I have this super annoying issue with my laptop where if the laptop goes to sleep it has a 90% chance that it won't wake up unless I forcefully shut it down and start it again. I say IF it goes to sleep because sometimes it doesn't even do that. The screen just goes black and the fans are still going for a long time. As a developer always on the go this is a real PITA because I am forced to always restart my environment and is eating in my time a lot. I saw this problem in a number of posts in Dell's support forums but none of the solutions there helped me out. I updated all the drivers I have the latest BIOS update maybe this made things worse I disabled hibernate mode made sure sleep mode is active I tried disabling the Bluetooth and removing any peripherals when putting the laptop to sleep and still nothing. This is driving me insane. It didn't use to happen that often. When it started happening I looked into driver updates and also updated the BIOS. Afterwards it seemed that it started happening more and more often that now it's almost all the time. I also checked the Event Viewer but everything seems clean there. There's only the error that mentions that the system was shutdown unexpectedly when I force shutdown the laptop . I will appreciate any help on this matter 🙏,0.097,0.806,0.097,-0.2602,-1,0

1,gj8905,Dell,2,2020/05/14 13:30:14,Afternoon,I am required to Disable Core Parking CPU Throttling in order to use my audio Interface UAD Apollo Twin X . Question about disabling Intel SpeedStep and C-State Control. XPS 15 9570  So in order to use my UAD Apollo Twin X I need to disable core parking CPU throttling. See below for the UAD documentation on this. Without disabling I am getting severe crackles and pops during playback both normal playback of files and in my DAW abelton and the problem is resolved immediately upon disabling core parking CPU throttling in the BIOS. See below for my audio settings and the optimizations I have implemented before disabling. I am very sure this is the issue and disabling is my solution. With Intel SpeedStep Intel Turbo Boost and C-State Control all diasabled via the BIOS my machine is running at a constant clock speed of 2.20 GHz - when idling and while under load. This is logical however not ideal considering I am losing a considrable amount of performace. I have tested leaving turbo boost on and this does not have a negative impact on my sound no crackles and pops and allows my machine to run at a constant clock speed of 3.91 GHz. My question is 1 Is there a reason the clock speed is 3.91 GHz and not the turbo boost speed of 4.10 GHz? 2 Is there an adverse effect of leaving turbo boost on while disabling Intel SpeedStep and C-State Control? I understand this will consume more energy but in terms of temperature am I risking overheating? Will the CPU still throttle when it hits high temperatures? I have run some initial diagnostics Temeprature while idling max core temperature 55C average 54C. Temperatures under load max core temp peaked at 86C I would say average temperature is about 68-70C. 3 Is there any adverse effect of regularly changing the BIOS settings? For example leaving turbo boost off when I do not need the extra performance and then turning it on when I do? I understand I am not the first person to ask this type of question but the info I have found while helpful has not got me understanding 100% of the situation. I am eager to learn and thank you for any help with this situation!

2,gj1ig5,Dell,0,2020/05/14 07:46:12,Morning,1 year old Inspiron's battery goes from 50 to 0 in under a minute and I'm so annoyed because I took the utmost care of it. What can I do?! On the day I bought this laptop I installed Dell power manager and set it so that it charges between 50 and 80%. As soon as it hits 80% it stops charging and uses wall socket power only Since I would use it as my desk most of the time . I thought that's the best care I can take of my battery. But a few weeks ago when I was using it while sitting on my couch the ''your battery is running low'' notification popped up. I thought that was strange because I distinctly remember it having a 50% charge. Anyway I didn't think much of it and plugged it in anyway. The same exact thing happened today except this time I know for a fact that it had a 52% charge. I don't know what to do I did everything I could to take care of it didn't let it get overheated didn't keep it plugged in overnight even did the dell power manager thing which most people do not do. What can be causing this? Can this be a software issue? I'm running the latest version of windows. Dell power manager shows the health of my battery is completely fine. My laptop just got out of warranty and I don't have extended warranty for it. Even if I did since Dell power manager isn't detecting any issues with it Dell won't help me out. I'm heartbroken. This laptop is my baby my work depends on it and I can't be having problems with an expensive thing like this. x200B ,0.054,0.871,0.074,0.7779,1,1

Everything is updated latest BIOS drivers etc Yes i logged a support call they want me to toggle power off and on for the monitors when it happens tomorrow morning Issue When i wake machine up by pressing keyboard moving mouse the PC wakes up i can see lights on devices flicker etc . However the two monitors do not wake up. To be clear the PC is 100% awake at this point and has left connected standby - i confirmed that in the event logs. To wake the up the monitors I have to either open the lid login press win p and choose extend OR unplug and plug the USB-C cable connected to the XPS 9300. I am unable to repro this by asking the PC to sleep and waiting for a few minutes - seems there is a time component related to it sleeping overnight many hours .

I currently have an Inspiron 15 with an i7-6700HK 16GB ram with 1TB SSD. The thing still runs like a champ and rarely slows down but I do notice the fan running more as applications are now becoming more intense with updates. I guess that is what a nearly 5 year old system does. I bought it as soon as they released it with this processor. I really don't want to buy a new one but the case has some issues of holding together Dell had probs with this particular 7000 series but never corrected it and other little things like power cord not the best now and hinges are getting weaker. All these little things add up to fix taking the time to do it and 5 years for a system is really good. Any direction to go would be great!,0.031,0.842,0.126,0.974,1,1

2,giz7vf,Dell,1,2020/05/14 05:39:34,Night,Dell XPS 15 9570 CPU error light code but working fine mini rant included  I recently had the BIOS chip replaced by a dell certified repair shop because the original chip failed. they did try to reflash the chip but the chip itself had failed After the chip was replaced and I got my laptop back there were 4 major issues The speakers were no longer working a problem with the intel SST driver that took me around 2hrs of troubleshooting to fix the driver I manually installed to fix the problem The BIOS being Password locked the BIOS dump the repair shop used to flash the new chip had a bios password but thankfully I was able to fix it by using you have to press ctrl and then enter twice for the password generated on this site to work. it's a recovery password of sorts from what I gather and the keyboard caps lock light being constantly on this might be a hardware related issue or a software one but here's what I could gather and finally the one really annoying issue the charge indicator light flashing constantly in a 2 Amber and 1 white pattern indicating a CPU failiure according to the service manual. Even after the BIOS has been updated to the latest version and the processor working flawlessly even under stress tests with undervolts applied the problem persists. I can't really think of a fix for this issue as I have already reverted all bios settings to factory settings and updated the bios twice. I can't open up the device for now as it would void my warranty as I would have to break the stickers on the screws I do not live in the states hence why I had to send my laptop into a certified shop and not dell directly to see if I could fix the caps lock issue. I don't want to take my laptop back to the shop as their customer support is garbage and they took 2 months to replace a simple BIOS chip. I'm sick and tired of dealing with the dozens of technical issues this laptop has. Everything from the DPC latency issues to the extremely agressive DPTF throttling to the sleep issues this laptop has been an absolute nightmare and I would not recommend anyone to buy any dell XPS machine until they properly adress the issues in a new chassis the 7590 shares some issues with other XPS 15 machines dating back to the 9550 . As a tech savvy indivicual most of the issues I was able to fix but I can't imagine the amount of people who got this laptop and had to deal with the dozens of issues without being able to fix the issues.

1,gj29t5,Dell,0,2020/05/14 08:23:55,Morning,XPS 15 9575 different core temperatures Hey guys So I've been using my 2 in 1 for university for quite some time now and I loved it so far. Since I'm using a 4k Screen I know its unnecessary but who cares I tried to get a bit more battery life and undervolted my CPU by 0 15V which is quite good I guess temps dropped for about 10 C which I'm totally fine with. Well in Cinebench runs my CPU throttled down to about 3 6 GHz to maintain like 90 degrees. I know Ultrabooks tend to get pretty hot so I was fine with that since well thats just the trade you have to make for it being so light. Well since I was already tinkering with my device I might aswell repaste the CPU am I right? Well thats what I did grabbed my iFixit kit opened up that thing carefully removed the Heatsink and CPU and removed that mess of old paste. You want pictures? I got you So after cleaning up that goo I slapped on some thermal grizzly and spread that stuff nicely on my GPU and CPU and well put some Thermal Grizzly Minus Pad 1mm on my VRMs. So I carefully installed my heatsink again gave that baby a slight wiggle and tightend the screws. The backpanel on and powered on the machine Of course the Battery was disconnected while doing the repaste I might be stupid but not that stupid . Well getting into Windows everything was fine my Idle temp dropped about 4 ish degrees and well I instantly started HW Monitor Throttlestop Which is always on by default and CinebenchR20 for some nice Benchmarks. This is where stuff gets weird. Well I've heard about Dell devices being super weird about cooling but dang my 3/4 core temperatures were constantly higher than 1/2. While under high load 1/2 were running at 83 C 3/4 constantly overheated for no apparent reason. Well I thought might just be a bad mount am I right? Well turns out wasnt a bad mount I repasted like 2/3 more times and no difference. I didnt notice such high temperature delta when I was dealing with the factory paste so what have went wrong? I noticed the heatsink does indeed has much more Paste on the upper site where I installed the new Thermal Pad for my VRMs Only the upper 4 in this picture and just simply removed the Pad. And voila suddenly temperatures dropped for about 8-9 degrees but I still have a temperature delta of about 10 C. I did notice tho that my Cinebench Score increased from 1700mCore Undervolt Old factory Paste to 1880mCore now Undervolt New Paste I have to mention tho that I had to repaste so much I ran out of Thermal grizzly and had to use some other 3rd party stuff But new Thermal Grizzly along wit 0 5mm instead of 1mm Pads for VRM's is on the way . While my CPU seems to run hotter under full load it doesnt seem to Throttle to 3 6GHz straight away it tries to maintain 3 7GHz which is nice seems that in the end something did work out. My Idles well dropped for 3 C I guess which is okay but I hope the fans not kicking in as much as in the past will improve battery life. Tldr Anyone else having Issues with cores having different temperatures after repaste despite a fairly good mount? And would you recomend putting Thermal pad on the VRM's since Its connected to the CPU heatsink?

1,gj0x84,Dell,0,2020/05/14 07:12:45,Morning,Dell G7 Heat/Fans I have a G7 15 laptop. Basically it gets crazy hot to the point where I can't even touch it. And this isn't just during intense gaming this is during light internet browsing with just two chrome windows and discord open. If I even have it asleep and plugged in to charge it starts to heat up and the fan turns on. I'm afraid to even charge the fucking thing because any time I plug it in it gets too hot. I've read on various internet posts that these machines just run really hot and this is basically normal... so am I just stuck with this housefire waiting to happen? Could there be something wrong with the battery or the charger? If so how do I figure that out? thanks.,0.09,0.872,0.038,-0.7206,-1,0

Not really looking for a solution as I have a new battery ordered and arriving in the next couple of days just curious. I removed the battery from my 9560 a few days ago as the swelling had made the track-pad near unusable. Mostly the laptop operates fine as a desktop but I have noticed that whenever I lose AC power unplugging the cable or turning the plug off the next time I use the laptop I have to first reset the BIOS to default settings. I always shut the laptop down properly before turning the power source off. I have also noticed that the laptop seems to turn on or the fans start and the power button lights up at least whenever I connect it back to power before I have pressed the power button. Does anyone know what causes the computer to behave like this? I am more intrigued than bothered by it.,0.054,0.896,0.05,-0.4031,-1,0

1,gizhn1,Dell,2,2020/05/14 05:55:16,Night,XPS 7590 screen/backlight flickering when using Nvidia GPU I've had my XPS i9 32GB 512SSD GTX 1650 4K LCD display for about 6 months and I think this started around a month or so ago - when I run a game or something else that uses discrete GPU the screen flickers slightly. This looks like the backlight brightness level fluctuates a bit resembling the flickering you can see on old CRT screens/TV. The flickering is not consistent across different apps. For example I can run my OpenGL demo and see no issues then run a test scene in Unity and the flickering will be very noticeable. In games this varies. This also depends on the view direction of the 3D camera in the app but I can't spot any correlation between the amount of stuff rendered and the flickering strength. It also does not matter if I run the app full screen or in a window the issue affects the whole display. The flickering depends on the brightness level. I usually keep mine at 20%. If I switch to 0% the issue is gone. If I crank the brightness up it becomes less noticeable with higher values. At 100% it's barely visible. This is also affected by battery level and charging status. I normally use Custom charging mode in Dell Power Manager 50% - 80% . I tried to charge up to 100% and the issue is less noticeable with higher charge values. The issue is completely gone when the laptop is charging or running on battery . In other words this happens only when I run on AC power and the battery is idle . I heard that AC can be not enough for the GPU so it can draw additional power from the battery as well not sure if it's related. I'm lost here. I have all the latest drivers and not sure if this started after some update or this is a hardware degradation issue I hope not . Tried downgrading video drivers no luck ,0.056,0.851,0.093,0.942,1,1

So I call the next day and they tell me they’ll get back to me when/ if it was changed so I say okay the next few days I get a email saying that the product has been shipped and the address was still the same WRONG address so I call support again they said they’ll change it then I get another email saying that the product will arrive once I send the monitor back to them so I think it’s okay and they’ve fixed it and I check the address again ITS STILL THE WRONG ONE I don’t know what to do at this point I called them again and again and again and NOTHING HAS CHANGED I understand that we’re in a global pandemic and times are hard but it’s not the difficult to change a address take 30 seconds not hard at all I’ve been sending emails calling support almost every day I don’t want to get scammed by dell that’s not cool I don’t want to pay for something that I don’t even get that’s not fair so please dell if you see this change my address thx,0.086,0.786,0.128,0.9493,1,1

The one audio output that does work is via HDMI output. Since HDMI does have embedded sound support I obviously tried all the software-related fixes to a problem like this e.g. driver updates BIOs updates and my initial thought was that it was strictly a hardware problem since my laptop has a Linux dual-boot and it too reports the same problem. However upon examining my computer's service manual I found that a single I/O Board controlled both the audio jack and a USB port next to it which is still working. This plus the fact the internal speakers were also broken leads me to conclude that this also isn't the case of a single computer part failing. To that end does anyone have any tips on diagnosing/fixing this problem?

I’m looking for something up to 950 which size is 13/14”. I’ll be doing university work on it and I’ll be doing some recording on software to create demos for band. So nothing too complex. But I do want a laptop which is smooth. I’m not incredibly fussed about battery life. I just want something which is a joy to use! I have looked at the new MacBook Air which is 900 but that doesn’t seem to have the best processor. I’ve also looked at last years dell XPS 13 which I can get for 850 new. I’m still not sure though.

If you need more info please let me know because I'm not good with computer terminology. x200B Anyway I've had my laptop for about 8 months now and my warranty is still intact. That being said I undervolted and changed things with ThrottleStop and XTU pretty frequently. The reason I'm making this post is that my laptop is overheating like crazy which makes some games pretty much unplayable. In the beginning it worked fine as I remember getting Destiny 2 and playing that for a few weeks once my computer arrived though loading it up now results in insane frame drops I wasn't even undervolting when I first played it . I also was very stupid and moved the User folder from my 100GB C Drive SSD to my 1TB D drive HDD which I then looked up and found out was bad I moved it back . I also retroactively did research and found that for the same or even lower prices I could get a computer that suffers these issues to a lesser degree even though I'm not sure a refund this late is legit . I really don't know what to do as this laptop can only smoothly run games that a non-gaming computer can like Minecraft League etc . x200B I know this post is really jumbled but if any of yall have suggestions as to what I should do please let me know.

1,giemnr,Dell,20,2020/05/13 08:31:48,Morning,Thoughts on the G5 15 for University/Gaming? I'm looking into the G5 15 as a laptop for class and gaming and I was hoping to hear your thoughts on some of its issues. I'm upgrading from a MacBook so I'd love the extra performance however its size and weight would be a large downside. I appreciate the discreet styling of it it doesn't scream gaming and looks professional too. I'd be hooking it up to a monitor so I wouldn't mind the screen for gaming. Now onto the issues firstly being the thermal throttling. I'm in no way a computer person so reading all the reddit threads about issues with heat kind of throws me off. Apparently the fans are really loud as well. I've also heard mixed reviews about the battery many youtube reviews praise it for long battery life compared to other laptops but I see people complaining about theirs. On the go I'd only be using it for taking notes and writing but apparently even then the battery is poor? In addition apparently there's a host of other problems such as issues with opening it after in sleep mode and handicapped performance. Many youtube and tech websites seem to give it positive reviews but this seems not to be the case elsewhere. I was really interested in buying the G5 but after reading all these reviews I'm a bit wary. Are these issues commonplace and should I still buy one? Thanks.,0.051,0.85,0.099,0.9077,1,1

2,gi9jld,Dell,0,2020/05/13 03:37:02,Night,To buy new or to repair? What to do to not despair Hello people despite the stupid title I am having a serious issue in front of me. I have had my lovely XPS 15 9550 for little over three years now and it always treated me nicely. A couple of years ago I broke the palmrest next to the left hinge and ever since lived without one screw with the palmrest that basically lifted away from the rest of the laptop everytime I moved the screen workaround was to keep pressure while opening the laptop this probably caused the issues I'm facing now with the power connector moving around in these two years I damaged the battery that now lasts me less than ten minutes making it a less portable portable computer. On top of that I've always been plagued by the shitty wifi card that wouldn't work with bluetooth. Now my question is would it be wise to repair and upgrade the laptop buying a new palmrest which is expensive hard to find and it takes a long time to get here a new 97Wh battery removing the HDD to fit it and buying a 500GB SSD upgrading from 8 to 16GB of RAM and getting a Killer WiFi 6 module? All of this would cost me between €450-500 and about a month waiting for the parts. My other thought was about getting a newer laptop used one maybe but I can't spend more than €800 is there anything worth it at that price range? I kind of fancied getting a 2in1 or touch display laptop for drawing but I doubt there is one with comparable performance to my XPS 15 at that price range. TL DR - My XPS pretty broke spend €500 to repair and upgrade or spend €800 to get something else?

1,gicbhg,Dell,18,2020/05/13 06:32:42,Night,Dell sent back a broken laptop? What do I do? Edit since title seems a bit weird my computer was not this damaged when I sent it in In a long story short I sent in my new laptop for repairs because it was under warranty and was having multiple issues. I have an Inspirion 7000 that I received as a gift since I needed a new computer for work. I bought it brand new and within the short time I have had it I have had nothing but trouble. x200B I reached out to dell support and they remoted into my computer to see if the issues were with my drivers. They did a bunch of changes and then because nothing changed sent me a repair. In the time between that day and the box their virtual repairs somehow 'broke' my wireless chip. I received my laptop back yesterday and the only thing that was marked as repaired was the wifi chip... nothing else. When I opened the computer itself the pen was jammed between the keyboard and the pen rest. The pen was so damaged that now it is completely broken and the battery in the pen was damaged to where I cannot use it anymore the pen got crushed . On top of that whoever did this repair did not do it right. For example one of the issues I was having was the left speaker was failing because it was screeching the tech's fix? Just turn the speaker off. Now only the right speaker works. My biggest indicator is that when they closed my computer up to 'fix' the wifi chip which only stopped working when they changed the drivers they closed it incorrectly damaged the left side and apparently from the worker I spoke to at the Dell authorized repair center here stripped screws because the bottom of the computer was not put on correctly. x200B I am at a loss. What do I do? I sent them photos and they are apparently escalating it to determine if they can fix the computer with damages they made. This was not even something that could have happened in shipping because the Dell technician not only looked at the issues but said that the computer was just so poorly messed up by Dell he did not even want to touch it. Do I have to just hope and pray they will fix the mistakes they made? Has anyone had this issue before? This is my first Dell laptop I needed it for my job since I have to move around a lot. I was using my gf's computer to do my work but ironically her computer just broke as well so I had to call out of work today. x200B TLDR New laptop lots of manufacturing issues sent back to Dell and the only thing they fixed was the wifi chip that they broke due to installing the wrong drivers . Sent it back broken are not telling me if they will fix it or not. No repair center near me will fix it because of how poorly it was fixed . What do I do??,0.094,0.839,0.066,-0.9542,-1,0

Recently I started noticing an issue with random micro freezes when doing pretty much anything i guess more often when i am watching videos or playing games . It is a maybe 0.5 - 1sec freeze when the audio just does a crackling sound during that freeze when some audio is playing then continues normally when it unfreezes. During this micro freeze i am unable to do anything and it is super annoying. Sometimes it happens once an hour sometimes twice an hour there is no pattern. I tried to do a clean reinstall of W10 and it did not help so i believe it could be a hardware issue or some recent update problem. I read on Internet that uninstalling Dell Support Assist should help however it did not fix the issue for me... Not sure if i want to uninstall every driver and test one by one. Any tips or advice how to fix my issue? It is just very annoying. Thanks in advance.

I purchased an XPS 15 7590 in November 2019 so about 7-8 months ago and yesterday it started overheating and crashing while just browsing online and running a word document. It got to the point where the laptop won't even startup and the LED is flashing 1 white 2 amber indicating a CPU/Motherboard failure. This is a big deal for me as I run an online business as my main source of income and am currently a student. So not having a laptop is making things difficult. I contacted Dell to ask for a refund as under Australian consumer law I believe this is a 'major failure' and that entitles the customer to their choice of repair replacement or refund. I wanted a refund as I believe the repair will take too long and even if done well I might have to deal with the same issue 7 months down the line which would be outside of warranty. I can't afford to buy another one Dell replied with The system has been in use for 8 months. With no dispatch history or opportunity to resolve the issue under Australian Consumer Law we can always offer service as a resolution. For now we'll continue to archive this case. This can be reopened within the next 10 days if you decide to change your mind. This is the third XPS I've had problems with and have completely lost faith in Dell.

A few months ago I ran into an issue where my computer will go into sleep mode randomly and I can't wake it. I do have a wireless keyboard and mouse but supposedly I should be able to wake it by pressing the power button but that does not work either. I connected with a dell tech that went through and changed my power settings to never sleep or hibernate but this still happens.

It doesn't happen often but I work from home and it's happened in the middle of a shift. No Bueno! I will say I have three monitors hooked up. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. If anyone can give me any ideas I'll watch for replies and let you know anything regarding specific specs if you need them. I'd love to solve this.

I figured that I would prefer the lighter laptop with the smaller battery considering that it will spend a lot of time plugged in in my dorm where I can just charge in between classes if necessary it’s a small campus . Now for the gaming part. I get that because of thermals that this laptop isn’t technically a gaming laptop. For a long time I wanted a MacBook but realized that I wanted windows so decided on the similarly designed XPS line. It was the best option as the other options for me was the Razer Blade 13 or 15 inch models which was far too expensive for me. I come from Xbox and I can manage with 30fps with low-medium settings on single player games to preserve the longevity of the device. The main games I plan to play when I receive the laptop is RCT3 I’m a nerd I get it Apex Legends and Minecraft. Rct3 can run on my toaster and Minecraft is fine as well. For Apex Legends considering the fact that I have the i5 model and not the i7 what should I do in Throttlestop or any other programs to keep temperatures down and maintain a playable frame rate. Ideally I would want 60fps even if that means playing at low settings however I could in theory manage 30fps because this is what you get on Xbox and what I have been used to my whole life . I would ideally want to keep cpu temperatures between 70-80C as I plan to keep this laptop for a minimum of 4 years. What are the best values to play with or enable to make this happen with the i5 or is it even possible?,0.014,0.871,0.114,0.9887,1,1

1,gi3n0c,Dell,9,2020/05/12 20:00:53,Evening,Dell Inspiron 7577 throttling Hi guys.When I bought a laptop it had problems with the cooling system. After 2 months I went to the store and I completely changed the cooling system under warranty this is important for the further story .The problems went away for some time but it seems to me that the change of season played a big role here for the winter I'm from Siberia . At the moment the problem has worsened again as summer will come again and the temperature in the room has increased significantly. For example in a game GTA V starts after 10 minutes at low-medium setting. i7 7700HQ 2.8HZ 8 GB RAM GTX 1050 TI M . The first question is whether this problem can be solved somehow? I have not tried processor undervoltage yet. When I wanted to clean my laptop and replace the thermal grease I was faced with the fact that the screw that holds the cooling system is very worn out. Also the screws are made of disgusting material that deteriorates very quickly. I did not disassemble the laptop before this was clearly done when replacing the cooling system The second question is - can I somehow pull it out and replace it? By the way this is the last bolt on the cooling system and it ruined everything The warranty on the product has already expired. And I did not find a problem earlier because for this it was necessary to break the guarantee seal. Sorry for my bad language. ,0.148,0.781,0.07,-0.97,-1,0

Tonight tho I noticed that it only whines when connected to the power cord. As soon as I detach it noise stops. It's pretty audible and annoying from standard desk using position and distance. Btw I'm noticing just now 3 mins into the charge that it's already starting to heat up quite a lot in the Shift key zone. An inch on the left of it it's umbearable almost. Battery was at 13% when I started but I usually use Dell power manager to do not stress it... Would you call this situation normal ? x200B Marginal consideration It's the third problem I encounter with this laptop last two where about bad assembly in the fron led area some little but visible space between shells and bluetooth module doing some strange things not software related I'm pretty disappointed it's my first high end PC and I expected a lot more quality from Dell at this point. ,0.143,0.805,0.052,-0.9549,-1,0

Turn off and on Thunderbolt in the BIOS. x200B Long I ordered a XPS 13 9300 with the i5 and 16GB of RAM in March. There a promotion to get ProSupport Next Business Day Onsite for free. When the laptop arrived it worked perfectly. Both USB-C ports could output HDMI with my USB-C hub HDMI USB A SD card to my external monitor. After about a month the left USB port stopped outputting HDMI. Power in and USB still worked. Windows showed this error Display connection might be limited. I contacted Dell ProSupport. Because it was just one port we figured the port itself had broken. I sent the laptop in and the entire mainboard was replaced. Because I had ProSupport it only took a few days. Laptop comes back works great. Then less than 24 hours later the problem came back. Again sent the laptop in comes back a few days later with a new mainboard. It was working well until today about a week. Same error. I called Dell again. I explained the issue and I was put on hold so an engineer could be consulted. While I was on hold I tried turning off Thunderbolt in the BIOS. I'm not sure why I thought of it. After rebooting my display worked again. I was able to turn Thunderbolt on again and the output still works. I would guess this issue can be fixed with a BIOS update but I'm not sure.,0.058,0.909,0.034,-0.5202,-1,0

I looked up some videos and saw other people had experienced the same issue and were able to resolve it by removing the battery and CMOS battery holding power button for 30 seconds reconnecting the batteries and holding down power button again. I tried this and would only get blinking keyboard LED while holding the power button to boot the laptop wouldn't power on. I figured I may have a drained CMOS battery as I hadn't used my laptop for a while prior to the crash. I ordered a new CMOS battery and replaced it today. I'm still only getting the constant blinking keyboard LED when trying to power on but now when I plug in the power adapter the keyboard will blink constantly either with battery connected or disconnected without me trying to power on.

I've been considering ordering an e6230 i7 board and putting it into my laptop along with 2x8GB DDR3. The whole thing would probably cost a little over 100. So I have two questions 1. Is the i7-3540M noticeably better than the i5-2520M? 2. Has anyone got 2x8GB DDR3 working with the e6220? Dell claims the laptop can only support 4GB per dimm but the processor should be able to handle up to 16GB total. Could just be Dell's limitations though. I love these old Latitudes and I feel like if I can get a substantial performance boost for only 100 I might as well take it.

However yesterday I upgraded from an EVGA 1070 Ti to a Asus 1080 Ti Turbo. I was sure to uninstall the 1070 Ti device before shutting down and swapping cards. Everything has been working perfectly. However I just realized that I can no longer get into the damn BIOS! It will be black screen for few seconds then boot to the windows login screen. I have tried pressing Del or F2 keys very quickly holding down as soon as I see the lights on the keyboard turn on. Tried at least 30 times of various ways. I noticed with this new card I don't even see the Asus boot up screen where it asks you to press Del to enter BIOS. I have default setting to show that for 3 seconds. It showed fine with the 1070 Ti. I also tried the UEFI boot via Windows 10 Googling around seems to be that certain GPU's don't play nicely with the Asus X570 boards. What is even crazier is I have an Asus GPU too. Seems other people have had same issues where they had to buy a different GPU and then it would work for example this thread Unfortunately I have sold the 1070 Ti already so won't have access to another GPU until next weekend. I don't want to reset the CMOS in case I can't boot into the BIOS as I do need my computer for work this week just in case I can't see BIOS screen. I have also tried swapping Display Ports on the GPU. I have a 3700x and of course can't use the onboard Display Port I tried just in case but nothing shows with that it is black since the 3700x requires discreet graphics. Also tried a full shut down disconnecting power cable. Holding down power for 5 seconds. Wait 3 minutes and do it again then power back on. Hit Del or F2 numerous times or even once every second or other times holding it down but each and every time it'll go to the damn Windows login screen. This is driving me nuts. Anyone had similar issues before? Thoughts? Edit I have latest 1407 BIOS. Everything was fine until I wanted to enter BIOS with this new card. Was in the BIOS over 50x last few days before upgrade.

1,gqlaem,ASUS,0,2020/05/26 15:00:33,Afternoon,Lighting service crashing my pc Hi everyone so the latest update of aura is being really strange. A couple months ago I got a new graphics card and PSU so I thought this would be a good time to do a Windows reset. I went through the whole process of reinstalling all my software as you do and then every time I logged in after a few seconds and it was always in the same amount of time my pc would completely crash deadlocked not being able to do anything. I even struggled to get into safe mode and this was a problem especially with my coursework deadlines coming up with all my important files on my pc and requiring my pc to finish them and send them off. I reinstalled windows a few times because of this and it would keep happening so I thought it had to be a driver or piece of software and at this point I didn't think it would be a background service so I eliminated everything on startup and that didn't work. I then thought I found a solution but I didn't. This was that wallpaper engine uses high priority on boot which was experimental and at this point it would have made sense that this was the problem. So I got rid of the high priority on boot and that worked but only for a couple weeks. After these few weeks I decided to change up the lighting as I was getting bored of the colour scheme so I load up aura and boom... Crashes and deadlocked. So I force shut down my pc and the problem was back struggling to even get past the log on screen without my pc deadlocking. I then found a Reddit thread about this and one guy found a solution but I can't find the thread so I thought I would tell everyone and keep the problem updated for anyone that hasn't found the solution until there is a fix. Basically there is a folder called lighting service. If you manage to get into safe mode on windows then - go into your documents or file explorer whatever you want to call it - go to your main drive - access program files x86 - delete the folder called LightingService - restart your pc and log in normally - search for AURA in the start bar then right click and click uninstall - this will take you to a list of applications you will want to uninstall AURA and aura service - once this is done reboot and log in normally - reinstall Asus aura and follow the download instructions. So far this is working for me. I am not going to denounce Asus as it obviously isn't a big enough problem on the scale of how many people are experiencing it but I am disappointed that an application such as aura has such an impact on my pc to the point where it is unusable. I hope this helps people out as I struggled finding a solution online so I thought I'd post it myself once I found it. If this turns out to be a temporary solution then I shall update this post.,0.066,0.866,0.068,-0.2474,-1,0

1,gqbe2r,ASUS,4,2020/05/26 05:57:59,Night,Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi issues I built a system with an Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus WiFi With a SAPPHIRE NITRO RX 5700 XT. I started to play Battlefield 5 and the game started to present a black screen and the pc froze no restart and no ability to restart via windows . Soon afterwards I started to have issues while booting. Sometimes the board doesn’t pass the GPU verification white led and the board won’t post. When it does sometimes I can play for hours with no issues. Thought it was related with the graphics card but even with a new gpu the same thing happens. Have the latest bios and drivers. I have seen other ASUS X570 users with the same issues and board replacement does not fix the issue as well. In the event viewer there are no errors logged only the kernel failure happens when the mobo suddenly loses power . So it's not a windows or driver issue its a hardware issue. x200B And it's related with power since the bizarre problem happens a while on Windows when it crashes the PC but it doesnt reboot it rarely happens . b on the first boot of the day it takes several resets to finally boot up the machine. The issue is becoming worse every day. At the beginning with 3 resets i could boot up the machine now with 6 or 7 I'm still not able to boot up the machine. c once it boots I can run heavy duty games with no hassles. Before I had frequent crashes in BF5 but after some tweeks on the power options of windows it stopped crashing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- x200B UPDATE I found the issue. On my MB I have the following layout X570 TUF layout So the green connectors are mandatory connectors and the red one is optional if you want to go crazy on extreme overclock. My Corsair 750X had these cables Corsair PSU 750X and 850X connectors I was sharing a 12v 6 pin connector to feed my 5700x. Also the 2 pin that merges into the 4 pin to do a 6 pin connector for the graphics card is a bit flimsy. You have to connect first the 2 pin connector and then the 4 pin one onto the GPU. This is because the 4 pin connector has a small plastic that holds the 2 pin connector in place. So if you connect otherwise the 2 pin can break lose from the GPU connector and can cause these type of problems. Also I removed the additional 4 pin 12v connector from the motherboard and connected 2 individual 6 pin cables to the PSU and connected each one to the gpu. No issues now. Maybe this was a noob mistake since this is my first machine after being retired for the last 10 years but still I managed to follow some instincts before starting to send parts to RMA.,0.109,0.862,0.029,-0.9897,-1,0

It is loud enough that I can hear it from across the room. The tone is around 120 Hz. Now I know typically this is usually GPU coil whine but I think it's the MOBO in this case. I swapped my GPU with my old 980 TI and the sound is still there but a bit quieter. I tried both GPUs in my old build z170-A MOBO and both are completely silent. I've tried a different PSU and I've turned off every fan but the sound is still there. Has anyone else experienced this? Also I only successfully boot 60-70% of the time as well.

I could easily get into the BIOS by holding down F2 for a while but today it stopped working. I held down F2 while powering on to get into BIOS but I was greeted with a black screen. So I restarted by the power button and let it start as it should and it did perfectly without any hiccups. But from then on I can't access the BIOS No BIOS wasn't updating then . It gets stuck there at the black screen when I trying to get into BIOS. I left it at the black screen for 30 mins but nothing happened. The internal fans keyboard lighting were all working fine but I couldn't see anything on the display. I hooked up an external display and repeated the same but nothing showed up in the external monitor. Then I removed the pre-installed m.2 ssd from the board and put another blank ssd in it and and it booted it. It came to the BIOS page as usual. But I can't access it without putting a blank drive. My laptop boots up perfectly and functions well without getting into BIOS but it stays at the black screen during the BIOS. I need to rearrange the boot order but I can't do it. I reset the setting in the BIOS while with the blank ssd but that didn't fix it either. I am at a complete loss here. Please help me out.,0.038,0.842,0.12,0.9747,1,1

On Fortnite I expected my frames to be well over 144fps so I could make proper use of the 144Hz. This assumption was backed up by numerous videos showing a streaming fps of around 110 at epic setting. I turned down my setting to low cause I always play on low but the performance did not improve at all. The fps was unstable even dropping down to 80 fps at some points. I have updated all the drivers and windows as well as following multiple tutorials on youtube on optimising my laptop and Nvidia control panel settings. Nothing seems to be improving the frames and performance. Please advise what I can do. I have noticed a lot of Asus software running in the background e.g. Asus software manager .

I am absolutely in love with this system. I was at first unsure about the whole “mesh WiFi ” idea and I had tried a couple of systems that didn’t live up to my expectations and was about to go back to my trusty AirPort Extreme when I happened to come across the ASUS ZenWiFi CT8 whole-home mesh wifi system. Now I will admit it was purely the design of these things that I fell in love with first followed by its impressive list of features and some pretty impressive specifications. Just looking at the box this system comes in you just know you’re getting a quality item inside. The box itself is simply gorgeous... I’d actually be sad to throw it away. Inside I was greeted by two identical routers well-protected in form-fitted egg crate packaging. Interestingly there was no manual included and none could be found online either. They did include a poster-sized quick guide that should get you going but it won’t help you with anything else. Nonetheless the interface is pretty familiar if you know Asus routers and their awesome User-friendly firmware. And you can go online and find manuals for similar routers that will help a lot. These routers are gorgeous. I really love the look of the sleek black finish with the brushed-metal texture. Picking one of the units up I was impressed with the weight of it. Shining a light inside the vents I could see some substantial metal heatsinks inside which gives the product some good heft. And the silicone base covers the entire bottom of the unit keeping it firmly in place and safe from sliding or tipping over. The air vents are attractive and well-designed for maximum air flow to keep these powerful routers cool. The power adapters are very small and light and resemble iPad chargers. The Velcro strap that’s on the power cable to keep it tidy is a nice touch. Setting up the system was very straightforward and only took about 10 minutes to get fully up and running. You have the option to set the system up either through a web browser interface or the Asus Router App with your iOS or Android device. I tried both methods and although they look slightly different visually both methods accomplished the same result. Basically they’ve made the setup process almost automatic only prompting you to enter a user name and password and an SSID. I appreciated that they’ve included the option to split my WiFi network into three SSIDs so I can control which devices connect to my 2.4ghz band and which would be better served by the faster 5ghz bands. Once everything was all set I was stunned at the speeds of the wireless backhaul. When I tried a speed test with the units about 20 feet apart I reached speeds of around 350Mbps which I thought was quite impressive. But I have Ethernet cables running throughout the home so I was able to connect them hard wired to get the full speed I pay for from my ISP which is 600mbps. I get this speed all over my house and yard and I love that my phone signal never gets dropped as I move from one point to another. The aiMesh roaming capabilities are impressive and seems to work flawlessly almost always keeping me on the closest node giving me the best experience possible. Even with around 35 devices on my network both wired and wireless I just can’t seem to trip up this system at all. I even tried streaming high definition AND 4K video on every display in the house simultaneously - 11 video streams - and still couldn’t break the ZenWiFi. It didn’t even buffer the videos at all and there was no degradation or skipping of the picture whatsoever. I was very impressed with this system’s overall performance. I actually loved this system so much that I felt confident enough to purchase the wifi 6 version of the ZenWiFi to extend my coverage and capabilities even more. To my surprise they were recognized and incorporated into the system as soon as I plugged them in. Now I have the benefits of WiFi 6 802.11ax and it works with my existing system seamlessly and I love that. Who is this system for? I think this system would be perfect for homeowners or small business owners who are looking for a truly set-it-and-forget-it Home Networking experience while still having the advanced configuration options power users need. It’s also a great system for those who need the flexibility to add to their system as their WiFi requirements grow. And if you’re looking for a mesh WiFi system that delivers your true maximum internet speed pretty consistently then this system is for you. Mine is 600mbps and I often get 650 on WiFi. And since you are getting two identical powerful routers in one box you’re getting excellent value for your money as well. I think ASUS has hit it out of the park with the ZenWiFi system. And with the two year warranty I expect these to provide years of trouble-free WiFi. I hope you enjoyed my review and found it helpful!,0.028,0.792,0.181,0.9997,1,1

Only months ago I had literally no clue what WiFi 6 was let alone a “mesh”... and I certainly had no idea I would soon be on the search for the a new WiFi system... And upgrading my phone... And my internet plan... basically in the process of future-proofing my home networking gear to kick off the 2020s in WiFi style. And with the growing number of smart devices being added to my network on a regular basis I came to realize that a mesh WiFi system was something I should consider when looking at my next WiFi solution. In this review I will explain why I made the decision to upgrade my WiFi and why I chose this particular system out of a muddled sea of choices. So why did I feel the need to upgrade my Wifi? I was perfectly happy with the trusty AirPort Extreme which still worked perfectly and had stellar WiFi 5 wireless coverage and provided amazing speeds. Long story short WiFi 6 is why. The latest standard in WiFi. Well I pondered my own situation for a moment and came to the conclusion that maybe it was time to retire my AirPort which is almost 10 years old. I first looked to Apple but unfortunately they’ve decided to exit the home networking industry and are now just recommending any mesh system with Mu-Mimo/OFDMA. Now I had no clue what a mesh system or any of that even was. But the more I learned about it the more I realized that WiFi 6 and whole-home mesh system was the way of the future and that’s where I wanted to go with my own home network situation. So how did I decide which mesh system to get? There were about a half dozen contenders available that seemed to suit my needs but the ones I really wanted were way out of my price range. I learned really quickly that I wasn’t going to get the speeds I was looking for unless I adjusted my budget accordingly. With these new mesh systems you definitely get what you pay for in terms of raw performance but I decided to look in the mid-range of the mesh system lineup. So I narrowed my search down to a few flagship WiFi 6-capable offerings from a few top brands. Lucky for me my search quickly ended when I found the ASUS ZenWiFi XT8 whole-home mesh WiFi system. So I purchased a set and I can’t wait to share my experience. Spoiler alert... I love it!!! First of all the design was the number one thing that attracted me to this system. I was immediately struck by the beautiful charcoal finish of the ASUS ZenWiFi routers and I was really intrigued by the possibility of incredible WiFi speeds through the dedicated 5GHz wireless backhaul. I also needed a system that accommodates the ability to expand as my network grows... This system strikes the right balance between price and value for what you get. It’s a very high quality piece of equipment and you can tell right away when you get them in your hands. To me they were worth every penny. Each router is about 6 inches wide by 7 inches tall and 3 inches deep. So they are a pretty decent size but not terribly huge like some others. Accompanying the routers is a basic but informative and easy to understand quick-start guide. I was disappointed that they didn’t include a user manual with this system and neither could I find one online. But the user interface is familiar and there are manuals for similar models that will help. Underneath the routers we find a single Ethernet cable and two 19w charging adapters. The charging adapters and cords feel well-made and come with a Velcro strap on each one for cord management. On the bottom of the routers we have a fully non-slip base and the weight of the giant heatsinks inside these units ensures they won’t easily be tipped over or pulled. I really love the way these routers look... I think they’re just gorgeous and I think they would suit just about any decor. They can be proudly displayed on a shelf or hidden among books or picture frames without drawing too much attention. They come in two colours white and charcoal black. And although I think they look great in white I really wanted to get the Charcoal ones. But these were impossible to find at the time of purchase so I settled on white. That being said I was pleasantly surprised how beautiful they looked when I actually saw them in person. The plastic has a modern brushed metal texture to it and even has subtle hints of sparkle on the surface which I think is a nice touch. The top has a decal with an interesting 3D texture to it as well. On the front near the bottom we have a single white LED which you can shut off in the settings if you prefer. The LED colour indicates the router’s status and lets you know of any problems. On the back of the router we have a 2.5G Wan port which is unheard-of on most high end routers let alone a mesh router! And we also we have four 1G LAN Ports which can be used to connect devices or a switch can be used to connect many more devices. A USB 3 port is included and can be used for printer sharing or connecting an external hard drive for personal cloud storage. I can even do Time Machine on my Mac with this router. The setup process was incredibly easy. I simply plugged in the power cord connected one of the routers to my ISP’s modem brought the second router close to the first one for the setup process downloaded and opened the router app and from there the App pretty much took over. All I had to do was follow a few prompts. The router initially created its own setup WiFi which the router app then connected to facilitating a perfectly streamlined and automatic setup process. It only took a few minutes. At this point I was given the option to name my WiFi network and I was even given the option to separate the WiFi bands into separate SSIDs if I wanted to which is a feature not found on a lot of mesh routers. At this point the node is automatically set up as well and with that the network was all set and ready to use. You can bet first thing I did was check my WiFi speed. Incredible! I had to recheck it since I didn’t believe it at first. But yes... I was seeing download speeds of 740mbps! On WiFi! On my own little private miniature cell network! Even as I moved from one end of the house to the other it seamlessly connected me to the closest node! I was truly impressed to see true wired speeds on my WiFi network. I easily reached 700 Mbps in all corners of my home. It’s amazing. And I didn’t even plug in the Ethernet cables I had running all over my house. So I thought why not connect them all by Ethernet and test the wired backhaul performance. It so happens that Ethernet backhaul frees up the second 5GHz band for use by devices! This is a huge advantage over some other systems which don’t have this option because now I have a total of three SSIDs to connect to making my network faster and more efficient by selecting which band is suitable for a particular device. Smart connect seems to work beautifully automatically steering traffic and connections to the appropriate bands and ensuring a solid and consistent WiFi experience all day long never dropping a connection. But I chose to disable dual-band smart connect because I personally prefer to choose which band is best suited for a particular device. Whether it’s through the app or through the web interface this router is rife with configuration options. You can adjust and fine tune settings just the way you want like any other router. A lot of mesh systems have an overly-simplified interface which can be frustrating for someone who wants to fine turn their system to their liking. The ZenWiFi system lets you choose a simplified interface or a more advanced option which tinkerers will appreciate. When you open the app you get a visual overview of your network with a clear visual picture of how the network is structured with sharp colourful graphics and a ton of menu options. All the information pertinent to your network is available at-a-glance at any time anywhere you are in the world. All the connected devices are listed and you can do many things to personalize your network such as creating user profiles for family members limiting bandwidth or blocking certain websites for certain users or devices. Restrict internet access to certain times set bedtimes for the kids’ WiFi. With free lifetime online protection you can be sure the network is safe from malicious attacks viruses and intrusion which many other router manufacturers charge for. And with just a few clicks I can adjust settings for all my wireless bands enable or disable wireless backhaul add more nodes check and track internet bandwidth and usage manage my cloud storage with my external connected hard drive...even add a vpn. Finally I feel better knowing that the app will notify me of new device connections and suspicious activity and firmware updates. Staying on top of those important things is something that’s not easy on other systems. Although the app is impressive it is quite buggy for a mature firmware platform. I found several little quirks and oddities throughout the interface that hindered the experience and sometimes even required a full factory reset. Sometimes when I make a change to a setting and apply it the system simply reboots and ignores my wishes and lets me believe it changed the setting when really nothing actually happened. For example when I disable the switch for wireless backhaul the router reboots and the wireless backhaul remains enabled and the switch turns back on. Although un-hiding the 5GHz-2 SSID opens the third band for use there is really no way to shut off the wireless backhaul and there’s no option for 160MHz channels a feature I expected to be available on this system based on early reviews I saw. I also tried turning down the radio transmit power to experiment with my cell size and the setting actually seemed to do nothing to affect the transmitting power. Another frustration was when I wanted to dedicate the third 5GHz band to WiFi 6 mobile phones exclusively by enabling the “AX Only” option. But changing it to AX Only didn’t seem to work as expected because non-WiFi 6 devices were still able to connect even with AX Only enabled. Some settings just seem to be for show and really do nothing at all simply rebooting. Although it does says it’s applying the changes I made the results are hit-or-miss. But despite its many quirks the interface is actually very good. Just like any other ASUS router interface. And most important it just works. So who do I recommend this for? This is not a system for everyone. The XT8 is a mid-range mesh system meant for folks who want a balance of speed ease of use and value for the dollar. It’s best suited for home or business owners who wish to stay on the cutting edge of new technology and want to future-proof their small networks. But there is an early adopter’s tax for WiFi 6 as it is still a fledgling standard and with WiFi 5 continuing to exceed the needs of most people these days it’s hard to justify the higher investment in WiFi 6 when there are adequate WiFi 5 systems that will do the job at half the cost of a WiFi 6 system. So for those with more modest wireless networking needs I’d recommend the ASUS ZenWiFi CT8 mesh system instead which is sure to be more than enough for 99% of people’s current and future needs. But if you’re paying for gigabit internet access and wish to realize those incredible speeds consistently on your WiFi 6 devices this system can do it all day long in the right conditions. For me the ASUS XT8 Whole Home Mesh WiFi system has worked perfectly and it just hits all the right notes so it gets my enthusiastic recommendation. I couldn’t be happier with it. I hope you found my review helpful!,0.037,0.813,0.15,0.9998,1,1

Now i decided to expand and bought another Samsung 970 evo plus 1tb and put it in the m.2 2 slot and it doesnt work. I switched these around and the m.2 1 reads the 1tb but still the m.2 2 doesnt read. So both m.2s work and as far as i understand theyre both nvme so they should both be able to work with the mobo. Ive been all over the bios trying to figure out how to trigger the m.2 2 slot but i can only find options for the m.2 1 control. So the question is am i missing something or is my mobo just broke?

It's sad how corporate development has such a negative effect on a business. Killing off loyal fans but maintaining the bottom line because there is just so many people in the world now and the company is big enough to portray quality that leads to making enough off the ignorant.

1,gpdtz3,ASUS,1,2020/05/24 14:15:11,Afternoon,Need help! ASUS Q535UD Laptop won't boot! Hi I've noticed lately that I'm having trouble with getting my ASUS Q535UD laptop to boot up. The lights on the side like the power button and the one next to the battery icon with the squiggly lightning inside it are both lit up but the cylinder shaped icon doesn't blink indicating any activity. It does this sporadically. Sometimes I plug in the power cord and within a few minutes it boots up. Sometimes I have to literally unscrew the back lid and take out the battery from the inside plug in the power cord to boot up and then replug in the battery. It always boots up when I resort to the worst case scenario last step. It's a royal pain getting this thing opened. I already went ahead and purchased a new battery just in case I need it in the future. I got this laptop in Nov 2018. I use it alllll the time for 3-5 hours a day or more. Sometimes I use it as a Plex server and google street view or google earth and that's really the only time I hear the fan blowing unless it's 90 degrees outside which can't be helped but I'm not doing serious gaming on it or photoshop etc. I replaced the HDD it came with and all of my drives are SSD. So I know it's not a drive failure. I THINK but I'm not sure if it's the battery that needs to be replaced but I just find it strange that I would need a battery this soon. I thought batteries lasted 1000 charge cycles or 2 to 4 years. I did a battery report and it says I only charged this 137 times. I'm just incredibly worried that it's something that will cost me a small fortune to fix bc I don't want to have to get this laptop replaced. I love this laptop. It's the nicest one I've ever owned and I already threw down so much money on it. If I took it to UBreakIFix would they charge me to look at the laptop? If anyone has any suggestions or can give me an educated guess as to what the problem is please let me know. My product is out of warranty as well. Is it worth it to get an Asus Warranty extension?

Hello everyone recently my UX433FA's keyboard is behaving extremely weird starting from repeated key presses key pressing on its own key not registered when being pressed and this recent anomaly. The 'B' key and some other keys was registered as another keypress I included a video where this happened. When I press the 'B' key the Ctrl key was registered. and when I spammed it finally the 'B' key registered. oh and also recently the spacebar doesn't register x200B All these anomalies come and go randomly so on one day I can use the laptop just fine on another I was figuring out how to control my keyboard like a caveman. Those anomalies almost cost me my exam during my online exam my down arrow key started pressing on its own and I couldn't scroll back up since it's spamming the key. All these behavior started when I stopped using my laptop for a week I turned it off not sleep for a week. When I turned it on its like the keyboard caught covid-19. I tried to use an external keyboard to see if the problem is software related it functions fine with an external keyboard. I also tried the laptop keyboard in BIOS at that time I was testing the right arrow key since it was unresponsive and it wasn't responsive in the BIOS too . I tried reinstalling windows 10 and used the laptop in Ubuntu 20.04 in both case the problem isn't solved. My BIOS version currently is 309 I also updated my touchpad drivers and etc through MyASUS software. I purchased the laptop in August 2019 so the laptop is almost 10 months old now.

It has run very smooth at mid graphics for almost two months of daily use up until this past week or so. The issues started out with big frame drops and FPS lag spikes but it evolved into black flickering of objects and surroundings in game now. It seems to be getting progressively worse no matter what different settings I let the graphics run on. It runs a GTX1650 and an Intel i7-9750H and I monitor the temperature of cpu and gpu constantly while gaming since its a notebook neither have gone over 65 degrees Celsius since I’ve owned it. It regularly holds temperature under load around 50-55 Celsius. I have tried twice to acquire an RMA for a fix under warranty and it just gives me “undefined” and says I will receive an email telling me what to do with it which I have not received yet. Overall I love this thing and I just want to get my GPU repaired or replaced so that I can continue enjoying my favorite games on it. Does anybody know what I can do to contact them directly about the issue with the rma? All I’ve gotten online seems to be an endless cycle of FAQ and check repair status links.

It worked perfectly until I suddenly couldn't use my mic anymore yesterday when I went on Discord neither with my headset nor with the mic from the laptop itself. I thought it had something to do with my Discord settings at first but my mic just didn't work anymore for any app. I have been searching for solutions online but nothing worked so far. I looked at my privacy settings to see if I allowed apps to use my mic but that was okay. I could not change the volume of my mic with the general mic settings because there was no mic detected. I also didn't find vdeck.exe in my task manager like a video suggested. I still have a guarantee on the product but I have to use my laptop a lot these days so it would be really helpful if somebody could help me out.

So if this was solved I would really appreciate the link. Thank guys. So this is my problem. About one year ago I bought an Asus N580GD. I don't use it for gaming well sometimes haha . Basically I use it for Lightroom Premiere Atlas.ti an the office suite. About two days ago Windows upload some updates. Unfortunately I don't remember which ones. It wasn't a big one that's for sure. After that some software start to fail. Adobe Premiere Zoom Discord and PowerPoint wasn't work because of the microphone. In the case of Premiere all the audio wasn't working. So after trying every solution I found on internet I chose reinstall windows. After that everything went super wrong. SUPER WRONG. Long story short the battery went crazy. The battery have a design capacity of 48.105 mWh. And the full charge capacity went down to 14.830 mWh. I noted that something went wrong after install Windows 10 because the laptop shut down sudenlly with like 40% of battery. I tried some solutions I found on the web but nothing worked. Except for one. I calibrated the battery manually. I monitored the charging using command prompt cmd powercfg/batteryreport . The 100% battery was about 14.830 mWh. And then because no reason the battery report marked 260% of battery about 38.000 mWh. Then I unplug the laptop and use it until the battery was totally discharged. Then I charge it again until the super 260-266%. Everything seems fine in that moment. That was yesterday. And today my laptop about 40% of charge shut down again. And the battery marked 1%. Now the 100% is about 23.608 mWh. And now after curse the charger it marks 173% with a total of 41.000 mWh. Maybe is the charger? It seems that Asus Battery Health Charging doesn't for this model N580GD . I really don't know what else to do. And you will understand that it is difficult to leave the house in these times. I hope someone can help me here. I need your wisdom guys. Please! I added som images and the battery report Thank guys!!! x200B x200B ,0.11,0.73,0.16,0.9706,1,1

If you look at the Drivers and Tools page specific for my motherboard — Asus TUF Z390 — Plus Gaming WiFi — you’ll see that the most recent BIOS is v2606 released on November 1st 2019. However I accidentally pulled up the wrong product page earlier when looking for the board I have and came across the “Pro Gaming” version I have the “Plus Gaming” which has a more recent BIOS release — v2804 released on May 15th 2020. You can see that page here — Asus TUF Z390 — Pro Gaming I guess it’s possible that they’re working their way towards releasing a new BIOS for my specific board. and maybe it’ll be released in the next few days but I can’t imagine there’s that much different between the “Pro” and “Plus” Gaming boards. The only concern I had was that the BIOS for the “Pro” version wouldn’t have the instruction set for WiFi but I use Ethernet-only with my computer so I wouldn’t be upset if I lost it. Regardless I just wanted to know if it would brick my board or not. If you’re wondering why I’m so seemingly antsy to flash my BIOS it’s because I’ve had a not-fucking-fun-time with the current BIOS release Build 2606 has been a nightmare for me.

1,goghm3,ASUS,0,2020/05/23 01:57:53,Night,Scar II GL504GS weird fan behaviour Copy pasting this from asus forums because nobody replied me there oof So I have a Scar II and recently I noticed that the fans do not spin enough on overboost. This resulsts in the GPU and CPU both reaching 90C when playing relatively light games. Here's the weird part - when I set the fans to silent BOTH the GPU and CPU temps drop by around 10C !!!! in around 10 seconds while the fans dont seem to change speed. After a while the temperatures slowly catch up to the 90C from before. Is it possible that Silent reduced GPU and CPU TDP? But it gets weirder. When I set it back to overboost the fans start properly ramping up now on normal overboost speed instead of the previous overboost speed but after a few seconds they ramp back down. This is a recent software issue because I know the cooling system is more than capable of keeping both the CPU and GPU cool and because the fans do not spin as fast as they used to. The only time they spin fast is when i switch to overboost from silent but they ramp back down anyway after a few minutes. If it matters I have a 90mV undervolt which reduced the CPU TDP by around 10W under load but I still get crappy temps because the fans dont want to spin. EDIT Are there any programs that allow manual fan control for this laptop? I tried speedfan it doesn't detect anything.,0.045,0.881,0.074,0.8158,1,1

Because of this I need to go through the ASUS RMA process. I tried creating an RMA claim through the web portal in an incognito window and when I click submit I get a response that my Serial Number Undefined already has an RMA ticket open Undefined . Because I was having trouble opening an online RMA I decided to call the support number listed for motherboards on the support site I attempted to call the 1-812 number at 4 30 PM Central time or 2 30 PST which falls between 8AM and 6PM PST however I do not hear a ringer and I am disconnected after 2 seconds. What is the best way to get in contact with ASUS to issue an RMA request? Edit I just attempted to fill out the RMA on my phone. When I hit submit on the RMA form I got a Connection Failed dialog box. Up until this point I've only had positive experiences with ASUS.

Recently purchased a new ASUS TUF Gaming laptop FA506-II. Unfortunately it's been giving me some serious trouble with screen flicker. It can be present infrequently while I have it plugged in but it is most noticeable when it is running off battery power. Switching to 60hz from 144hz seems to make it less frequent but it still occurs. I've tried all the standard solutions that are out there for screen flicker issues but nothing seems to help. As far as I can tell the flicker does not occur in safe mode but it does occur in all windows and OS screens in normal boot mode. I've contacted ASUS and they've offered to have it picked up for an assessment but I have a feeling maybe it's just the laptop's power not being able to keep up with the screen. I'll probably send it in regardless but I was wondering if anyone out there has had any similar issues or knowledge about what settings are making the difference here to make this no longer an issue?,0.084,0.832,0.084,0.2803,1,1

I am having an issue with a Ryzen 3600x build with Asus X470 Cross hair hero Vii. The issue is that with the USB header from Corsairs CPU block plugged in the system will not post. The graphics card fans spin up and then spin back down and spin up again. The post indicator goes crazy and does not settle on a post code. With the USB header on the cpu block NOT plugged in the build posts fine and boots to windows fine. Ofc we can't control the pump speed or fan speed from windows without that USB header plugged in. If we plug in the USB header while booted into windows corsairs Icue software detects the AIO and we can control it. However if we restart it will not post until we remove the USB cable. The USB cable is plugged into a USB header on the motherboard the only header and not a Corsair fan hub because we don't have one. We've already installed latest bios X470 chipsets USB drivers through windows control panel.

As much as I would love to buy a nice desktop setup I don't have the money and probably won't for a very long time since I'm on a temporarily lay off until god knows when.

Is it even possible to switch out my graphics card on this laptop and if so can I do it on my own without likely breaking it? 2. If the answer to question 1 is yes where can I get a good decently priced graphics card that will fit this? 3.

First this is unrelated to my actually startup hardware issues. Second I unscrewed with screwdriver and stems came right off with the mount and it is therefore defective. Third why would I pay this if I can buy the same board at significantly LESS price than this price in CND ?

The problem is that my SSD isn't showing up in the Boot Tab of the BIOS but is recognized in the Advanced Options NVMe Configuration . What should I do to fix this? I've also considered using Samsung's Data Migration Tool to migrate from the HDD to the M.2 SSD but does that entail completely wiping my 1TB HDD and then migrating whatever is left which would be my OS onto the SSD? I'll provide more detail as needed. Update Looks like everything is working now. To fix my SSD not showing in the boot tab of my BIOS I opted in to get a fresh installation of windows on my HDD includes wiping it completely and then using Samsung Data Migration Tool to migrate my OS from HDD to SSD. Once completed I restarted my laptop and accessed my BIOS where my drives then appeared on the Boot Tab enabling me to set my SSD as my 1 Boot Drive.

Thermal design is a huge disappointment After using this laptop for about a week it is clear to me that this laptop runs HOT. CPU temperature on idle can be anywhere between 50-60 C and under full load the 4800HS can easily hit over 100 C. And the GPU temperature is not looking good either hovering around 80-86 while gaming 87 C is the maxium limit this GPU is allowed to hit . And of course the fan is loud and constantly spinning. So I decided to open it up and gave it a repaste with liquid metal today. And the result is incredibly disappointing... basically nothing change! I believe the laptop is already at it thermal design limitation and there's nothing you could do to improve it unless you want to open the air vent and void your warranty . For comparison my Alienware 17R5 temperature drop by 20 C after I repasted it with liquid metal. ,0.06,0.856,0.084,0.4742,1,1

1,gnl54v,ASUS,2,2020/05/21 15:02:44,Afternoon,Issue with a new Zen 2 build Hey I just build a new PC based on a Ryzen 7 3800X and an ASUS ROG Strix X570-F Gaming. Everything seems to be working fine with one exception VGA display. The first time I booted the PC my screens were showing “no signal” / turning off / showing “no signal” etc. in a loop. I had to force shutdown it unplug the graphic card an RTX 2080 Super boot the PC without it once and then re-plug it and boot it again to have it working. I got an error message telling me that the VGA adapter was incompatible ???? and that it automatically changed some settings I did not write exactly the message sadly . Then when I boot my PC everything works fine and my displays are working. But if I reboot my PC well this time I have nothing on my screens and the PC won’t event boot the same “no signal” loop . The “VGA” LED is on on the motherboard. I have to force shutdown my PC and then boot it and it’s fine. Obviously very annoying when PC reboots when updating Windows for example. Is there a known issue around that? Any idea what could cause that? The GPU is not at fault because it’s behaving properly on an other build Ryzen 7 1700X and an other ASUS motherboard .

The lights on the ram are on so I know they work but they are not recognized by armoury crate at all. Is there something I could possibly change in the bios of my B450-F mobo to help with this? I tried to completely remove armoury crate but I couldn’t figure out how so I decided to do a complete reinstall of windows and wipe my SSD where the program was installed. That didn’t help.

2,gn0xuq,ASUS,5,2020/05/20 16:28:34,Afternoon,ASUS WTFast Promotion a Scam also their customer service is horrible to deal with TLDR Do not buy their video cards in anticipation of receiving the 6 month WTFast subscription and may God have mercy on your soul if you have to deal with their customer service. My Experience Purchased an Asus 2070 Super in December with the 6 month subscription to WTFast promotion being a key factor in the purchase. I went through all the steps to redeem the subscription which includes pulling your video card back out of PC to find a tiny PPID that they need a picture of above and beyond serial numbers and proof of purchase etc . Although a bit of process could do all that in 15-30 minutes. A code was sent within a week or so to redeem on the WTFast site which I did and the time was added. Except that it was a 14 day subscription not a 6 month subscription as was advertised. I contacted WTFast and the response was that the codes are pre generated and sent to ASUS and that they sent me a 14 day code. Although frustrating seemed legit. So off I go to ASUS. Starting with their online chat service this required several separate chats before a legit ticket could be made and they asked me to reapply for the subscription. Which lead to no record of redemption . So the email game began. Over 30 back and forth emails have now been sent for about 2 months. During this time Have dealt with 8 different people had at least 15 different case numbers assigned for future reference I have been asked to provide an invoice at least 8 times. Provide screenshots of the error to which every time I have told them there is not an error they gave me the wrong code 6 times Provide the serial number or PPID twice above the 5 times I have applied on the website Received cut and paste messages about my video card or warranty issues a few times Told my video card was purchased in new zealand I live and purchased the video card in North America and not eligible for NA service told I had not provided necessary information with the information in the previous emails being replied to Literally every person I have dealt with through these emails well over 10 has either not read what I have wrote not gone through the notes or quite simply does not seem to understand the issue with no regard for trying to figure it out. Even compiling every single case number and every person I have been in contact with into a single email resulted in please reapply again which I had been directed to do several times already . Eventually they got back to me with a code after I had snapped. I was happy and relieved this was all over. Except as I entered the code my computer recognized it immediately. It was the same 14 day code I had already entered almost 3 months ago now. And here we are over 3 months since applying for a 6 month code and still no code. What's up ASUS? Are you just intentionally trying to do everything you can to make me drop this and forget about it to absolve fulfilling your marketing promises? Over taxing your customer service to the point they can't actually take time to read through the case to see what issues are without having to resort to sending cut and paste responses to things that have already been addressed? Rhetorical questions but this is absolutely ridiculous. If you're going to promote something follow through with your promises. This experience turned 20 years of loyalty to ASUS upside down. I have purchased multiple laptops mother boards video cards and other products over the years and was always quick to use my word of mouth to promote ASUS.

So I contacted the support centre and they're claiming it came with only 4GB of RAM and that they cant help. However the 'service form' states that prior to the repair it did have 8GB and on the laptop box it says RAM DDR4 4GB 4GB on board . Therefore the laptop should have 8GB total right?

I recently got a Benq XL2546 and am using my ultra-wide as a second monitor. I have noticed that I am now getting a white VGA light on my mother board and occasionally my bios wont prompt but my comp will still start up. I am still able to play games and everything I am just paranoid that my graphics card is going to die! The only fix that I have seen that works reliable is that if I restart my computer when it has the light on it will turn off on the new boot. It seems like the light is turning on with something with start up only I turned off fast restart and I have tried setting up my second display with a different port but that did not work 100% of the time The issues does not occur when I only have 1 monitor in use. Any ideas? I am thinking it is something with the bios but I am noob with PC building.

However now it has just stopped. My issue is the battery is dead so I can't try any software fixes and it also doesn't run while plugged in and the power cord connected. Is this laptop supposed to run with the power cord plugged in? What could be the issue? I'd really prefer not needing to buy a new laptop because of this.

3,gm9u2a,ASUS,2,2020/05/19 12:46:21,Morning,ASUS in my experience tries very hard to weasel out of warranties This is just my own experience Bought an ASUS chromebook from costco and within a year the automatic ASUS warranty period it simply stopped being able to charge. After checking the ASUS website I quickly found that this is a common issue that can generally be fixed by hard resetting the chromebook which is already rather dubious. Unfortunately by the time I noticed the issue it was already fully drained and could not be reset. Seeing that the product was still in the warranty period i contacted ASUS customer support and was informed that for some reason they had my serial number dated to a purchase in 2018. As proof of purchase they continued to demand a valid invoice from costco containing certain details about the order. The issue is that ASUS policy seems to be that for a valid proof of purchase the provided invoice/receipt must include the serial/model number. In the United States distributors like Costco NEVER include the serial number in any invoice instead using their own records item number . This ended up being a massive pain in the ass going back and forth between costco and asus customer service reps. What's appalling to me is that there exists such a ridiculous disconnect between these two companies despite costco selling numerous asus products and that the burden of solving this ridiculous miscommunication between these companies lies entirely on the consumer at least in my case. TLDR I would not recommend buying ASUS products from costco or any other warehouse type companies that you know don't provide the serial number in the invoice it's important to note that I do not blame costco for this because in most cases this information is not required for validating a warranty .,0.12,0.809,0.071,-0.95,-1,0

I am wondering if I will be affected by this with the X505ZA 2500U laptop and how so? Thanks,0.102,0.856,0.042,-0.5388,-1,0

As soon as I could afford a GPU I got one and shortly there after while playing games the ethernet port and 2 USB ports on rear IO quit working. 3 weeks of back and forth along with an RMA that ended with them updating bios which I had already done it is still a problem and I can't get them to help in any way. I'm done. Fuck Asus. end rant ,0.099,0.85,0.052,-0.6249,-1,0
1,gm8xn1,ASUS,2,2020/05/19 12:01:26,Morning,WIFI disconnecting often. Works great sometimes. Other times it disconnects completely until I restart my laptop. As title states my ASUS laptop running Windows 10 frequently disconnects from wifi. Sometimes it just stutters and goes away for maybe 10 seconds. Other times it will disconnect and just refuse to pick up the network until I restart the laptop. What can I do to fix this? It’s not a HUGE deal just more of an annoyance. I’ve had my laptop for around 4-5 years now. I don’t really want to upgrade since I have so much access to everything on it. lots of documents photos work related stuff.

1,gm787v,ASUS,4,2020/05/19 10:34:43,Morning,ASUS UX430UAR laptop stuck on ASUS screen? I was wondering if anyone has encountered a similar issue that I've been facing lately. My laptop was purchased a little less than a year ago. Whenever I update my laptop and sometimes completely randomly my laptop will get stuck on the ASUS In Search of Incredible logo screen. The loading circle/icon will continue to spin constantly the mouse cursor will be show up and move if you use the trackpad and eventually when it does end it will just go to a black screen where the power button will have to be held down to shut it off and start the process over again. I can even hear my bluetooth headphones sync while it's stuck on the ASUS logo screen. This repeats about 2-3 times before it finally gets to my lock screen and I can enter my laptop. When I try to update it will show the windows update screen for a little bit before going the screen going black and the issue above starts. Again other times it will just happen without even updating it. The laptop's fingerprint sensor also seems to have issues as well but works well apart from that. Does anyone know if this is a software problem? A driver problem? Is there any solution to this issue? I'm worried about it doing this at an inopportune time. If anyone has encountered a similar issue and has an idea for resolving please let me know. Thank you.

Hey All My first reddit post asking for help! I have been building my own PCs since the early 90's. I am stuck on this issue with my latest build using the MB model above. 4 calls to Asus forwarding to their engineering department alot of Google searches and trying many different audio drivers and tips from many tech sites still NO AUDIO detected on this board and an identical model as well My long troubleshooting details follow ISSUE I am unable to install or activate any sound devices on my PC with my Crosshair VIII Hero X570 chipset MBs. I have tried 2 new boards with no change. I am an experienced custom PC builder and have tried a multitude of ways to get it to work. There are no sound devices speakers available to select or activate in the Win10 Pro sound setup. Only sound devices are displayed for my 2 LG monitor's speakers . No sound from the front or rear audio port headers used many headphones/speakers removed all other MB add-in cards and all USB devices reflashed BIOS cleared CMOS turned HD audio on/off in BIOS rebooted many many times new Win10 install 2x. I want to use the on-board “Industry-leading ROG audio ROG SupremeFX S1220 with ESS ES9023P but my only solution so far was installing an add-on Sound Blaster sound card which works great but takes up a PCIe slot.

No sound from the front or rear audio port headers used many headphones/speakers removed all other MB add-in cards and all USB devices reflashed BIOS cleared CMOS turned HD audio on/off in BIOS rebooted many many times. I dug through device manager and look at all hidden devices - no issues shown. I bought another identical new MB same model - same issues with no sound. I installed and uninstalled dozens of Realtek drivers and utilities from Asus website and from other forum discussions. There are many sites sharing the same issues as I have with X570 chipsets - but with no resolution. I have tried many versions of chipset drivers from AMD too. I went all-in and reinstalled a fresh Win10 Pro… That still did not fix the sound issues. After several days of attempts and setbacks caused by a Win 10 reinstall I ended up having to buy an additional 50 Sound Blaster audio card to get sound on this setup! I have not tried any other X570 MBs. I have purchased Asus MBs for my PCs the last 15 years - a dozen models. The Crosshair VI and VII Hero MBs I still have work fine with 1700x 2700x AMD CPUs with Asus X370 and X470 chipsets. My same 3900x CPU had working sound with my Crosshair VII Hero X470 MB but never with the VIII Hero X570 model. So it sure seems related to the X570 implementation as some have noted online.

So I updated my RT-ACRH13 router's firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.382.52134 a few days ago and ever since then the connection drops randomly. The 5GhZ band disappears completely while the 2.4G band still shows up on the list of networks. It takes a few minutes for the connection to restore and for the 5G band to establish internet connection again as well as show up as a discoverable network to other devices. It happens quite often and for no reason. At times I've had to manually reboot the router. It literally started after the firmware update day.

The goal here is to build something super cheap that can be used for office work web browsing and watching videos. I was reading that the current Ryzen chips need a bios update to use them. I decided to go with an A8-9600 chip. Does anyone have any experience with these? Am I going to need to flash the bios just like I would for a Ryzen? Also I was reading through the QVL memory guides on the ASUS website. I was a little confused because these G.Skill Aegis' are listed but these are not. The both seem to be the same 288-pin DIMM. I apologize if this is a bit of a newbie question- its been awhile. If its not on the QVL does that mean it should work but there's no garuntee that the timings will be correct?

I've tried looking for videos but couldn't seem to find any answers so I decided to come here. Currently my settings for NVIDIA are 37% brightness 27% contrast and 0.55 Gamma. I'm horrible with these settings so it has been trial and error until this point that I've decided to ask. If this is the wrong sub for this please could any of you direct me to the right sub ?

1,glmk6q,ASUS,9,2020/05/18 12:20:30,Morning,Are my ASUS ROG laptop thermals normal? I bought a gaming laptop about a month ago. I've never owned a gaming PC of any kind before so I'm still being initiated to all of the nuances and rules of thumb and mental torture involved in optimizing for gaming. The specs of my laptop are - ASUS Zephyrus G GA502 - Ryzen 7 3750h - Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q - 16GB DDR4 RAM - Windows 10 I've been playing a game that is somewhat CPU and GPU intensive 60% CPU load 60% GPU and have been noticing high temperatures I know shocking for a thin-and-light . With the 'Performance' power management mode enabled in Armoury Crate I'm getting high rock solid frame rates. However I've noticed that after a few minutes the CPU begins to ramp up to 90 C. While this is happening there is very little response from the fans pretty much until it hits 90 and then the fans kick into overdrive. The core temp goes back down to 80 or so and then the fans slow down again and the process repeats I have Core Temp overlaid on top of the screen so I'm watching this happen in real time . I get that ASUS wants to make their laptops quiet while maximizing performance but this fan curve seems very delayed. I don't seem to be experiencing any thermal throttling so presumably this kind of fan behavior is what ASUS designed for. As an experiment I tried playing the same game under the same conditions but with the minimum fan speed set to 50% and saw much more comfortable temperatures - avg 75 C more noise but I typically wear headphones anyway . So obviously the cooling system works but ostensibly ASUS believes that as long as I'm below 90 it's all good. The fans do a decent job of keeping the CPU temp stable below 90 brief excursions above 90 are not frequent and usually only occur when loading a new map etc. so I guess this is just the temperature it was designed to operate at? In summary my questions are 1. Is 90C actually an acceptable temperature to run for normal gaming sessions? The consensus I see repeatedly online is that it's probably fine but not really ideal. In fairness the max rated operating temp of the Ryzen 7 I'm running is 105C so I'm well below that. Also I don't seem to be experiencing any performance hits at that temp. 2. Should I try setting a more aggressive fan curve to bring the temps down? I'm not interested in re-applying thermal paste or undervolting so this this seems like the easiest solution to me. 3. I know that running the fans more increases wear on the bearings but I'm assuming that having those croak is preferable to potentially shortening the life of my CPU/GPU or other heat-sensitive components. I don't game a whole lot a few hours here and there on the weekend. Is my thinking correct here? I sound pessimistic about this but in general I'm very happy with this laptop. I have just been going a bit crazy over the past few weeks trying to get a straight answer on why it's running hot and if that's actually Ok. Advice / education on this topic is greatly appreciated!,0.039,0.83,0.131,0.9944,1,1

The problem has been random instability. Using bios 1405 it went from random restarts nothing in logs nothing like a BSOD to refusing to boot requiring shorting the CMOS to boot. It would hang at the ram led. Got to the point where it would run for days fine then unusable for days at a time wouldn't post would run for a few hours that kind of thing then run OK. I was ready to send it back when 1407 came out. Using bios 1407 the instability seemingly stopped until this morning when it shut itself down for no reason. Now it restarted just fine today but now I'm on watch. Reading through various threads I'll log for future use the idea of disconnecting the Sata drives to see if it'll bring back a boot without messing with the bios. I was surprised when I saw a post with a similar setup having instability problems so I wanted to put this out there to see if it is still occurring and what's been going on. Because I'd like to go back to Asus and AMD because my 8 year old PC my kid uses has uptime measured in months.

I'm looking for an upgrade for my 4years old laptop and I came across some pretty good deals on the Asus TUF A15 gaming laptop with the Ryzen 7 4800H and the RTX 2060. I have some question for you fellows who already bought this laptop and I'm looking for some constructive criticism on it as I have plenty other options for a new laptop atm. Nothing related to performance because I already know this is a beast of a laptop in it's prince range! Firstly I saw some reviews that complain about the 144Hz monitor mainly complaints about the response time and the facts that it feels kind of slow comparing it to a 60hz bumped display instead of a smooth 144hz one. I am upgrading from a somewhat bad 60hz display and I am really looking forward to that 144hz smoothness and feel that it provides. Is this panel good or perhaps decent or is it kind of bad and doesn't provide a good 144hz experience? PS I don't really care that much about color accuracy and contrast. I want a good display for gaming and some student work not for video or photo editing. The next question is about build quality. I want to know your experience as of now with the plastic variant the black lid one. I am a student and I travel with the train quite a lot carrying a lot of baggage from my dorm to my parents house once a month. I want to be sure that it doesn't crack and it is sturdy enough to not brake while carrying it. Also I would like some views on the hinge if possible. Lastly I am asking about the any other complaints you might have and other suggestions you have in your pocket as of now from owning it or maybe complaints from a friend or relative that owns it atm. Thanks for your time and I'm looking forward for some replies! Have a great day!,0.065,0.834,0.101,0.8878,1,1

I had noticed the same effect on an Acer laptop that i then sent back to the store and I wanted to know if that’s normal. The effect is really little unnoticeable if I hadn’t seen it in the first place. My suggestion was that maybe the hinge keeps the lid more straight in those places so when i move the screen that’s the part where it is more rigid.

I am constantly monitoring the laptop temperatures using HWMonitor just to make sure everything is fine. On idle the cpu and gpu is around 39C -45C on performance mode. Whenever I am just watching lecture videos and taking notes my cpu will jump to 70C - 79C. I was wondering if this is normal for a laptop to reach these high temps by just taking notes. My concerns if I continue to take notes like this will it affect the longevity of my laptop parts since its in the 70s C. Is there anything I can do to help with thermals? Is this normal temp range for thi AMD CHIP? I bought a cooling stand from Amazon that is coming shortly.

Has anyone done this already and can answer my question? And even if you haven't maybe just take a look at the photos and tell me what you think. EDIT I think I might not have been clear.

He installed a fresh Windows 10 and that firmware update has to be downloaded and installed. If he pauses it none of the other Windows updates will install. Also I looked at his laptop's display settings and it's using the integrated GPU Vega 10 instead of the dedicated GPU NVidia 1660 TI Max-Q . x200B Any help would be greatly appreciated.,0.051,0.822,0.127,0.9092,1,1

1,gkwow0,ASUS,0,2020/05/17 07:41:20,Morning,0A and/or CC code a possible fix I want to share a story of getting these qcodes especially 0A as many people may RMA their mobo when a simple solution does exist. Worse yet they may spend a lot of money on a new mobo and cpu. I recently took apart my pc cleaned it and upgraded the custom liquid cooling loop. I put it all back together bled the air out of the loop and finally turned it on only to be greater with “0A” a qcode that no one seems to know what it means. After hours of searching online unplugging everything except the cpu and ram I had determined my mobo and/or cpu were dead and would need to get new ones. I took the pc apart expecting to get a new mobo and cpu. After learning that all ASUS ROG Maximus Hero XI are sold out I decided to mess around and eventually I figured out the problem The CPU heatsink in this case XSPC raystorm neo was tightened too much! I was able to boot with no heatsink dangerous I know but I had nothing to lose as I assumed it all to be dead . So I put the heatsink back on and then I started getting QCode “CC” instead. After loosening the heatsink it eventually booted. I want to stress that the heatsink screws were not cranked down when I started receiving these errors. Likely it is the fact that the heatsink uses springs so even though the screws weren’t tightened too much it was applying a lot of pressure on the CPU and mobo possibly warping it and having poor contact. TL DR if you tighten your CPU heatsink too much you may get “0A” or “CC” qcode.

I am currently in the process of doing a new PC build and I have ordered the Halo Lux Digital fan frames from Phantex to go over my noctua fans. I have ordered 4 of the 140MM frames and 3 of the 120MM frames. They will be installed in either a ASUS Helios case. The issue I am having trouble finding an answer to is how to effectively set up the RGB fan frames to my motherboard and still be able to run the Neon RGB strips from Phantex. Doing RGB is still new to me so forgive my ignorance however from the info I have gathered my motherboard ASUS Crosshair VIII Hero x570 has 2 5V addressable 3 pin RGB headers that are rated for 3A each. From the sources online each Halo Lux Digital fan frame 1A each. So does this mean no matter what I do I can only have 6 fan frames installed? Or is there another solution I can do? Like I mentioned earlier I would love to at least get the 7 fan frames sync to ASUS aura software then eventually add Neon RGB later. Hopefully someone can explain this to me like im a 5 year old.

So then I thought it was a driver issue so I went ahead and instead of installing asus realtek drivers I made the mistake of installing the realtek drivers from the official website WHILE the original drivers were still installed. So it broke stuff. Sonic studio is no longer compatible. So I then uninstalled the new drivers and tried again but no luck. Then I uninstalled the old drivers too for a fresh installation of the real drivers but unfortunately there were remnant files which I can't delete. I went to the registry and tried to delete HDAUDIO there but still nothing worked. It said deleting key error or something I don't remember.

I bought a single LED strip to go with my x570-P motherboard. The aura lighting effects intermittently start flickering badly strobing really very high RPM . What's weird is that this only happens on light transitions rainbow modes changes in brightness on static it's fine. Weird thing 2 is that it's not persistent - it seems to happen upon boot sometimes but then another day or after a few restarts will be absolutely fine. Weird think 3 is that normally a reboot is the only way to get it to stop but on one occassion updating the Armory Crate drivesoftware it was both at once and restarting it did the trick.

I ve been using it mainly for gaming and I have this feeling that this pc is way far from its peak performance measured by the numerous benchmarks i saw online . I ve tried it all updating graphic drivers windows update bios update armory crate uninstall and re install ... The main game i am using to solidify my point is warzone i ve seen people using the same laptop and getting nearly 90 fps with everything on high while i mstruggling to get 40 to 50 60 in best cases fps on medium settings . Same goes for CS.Go i m getting 80 90 fps on high preset while benchmarks are giving double those numbers for the same cpu gpu combo. The only difference is that I m having the 8gb version single channel memory and i know ryzen cpu benifits from dual channel memory performance wise but would it be to the point that having 8gb of ram cuts down the performance by half ? I mean even in League of legends i m getting like 70 to 90 fps which is not matching the high hopes i had for my very first gaming laptop .

I installed it and everything seemed to work well however I ran into a few problems. The first was that I got a CPU fan error with my NZXT Kraken X63 so I went into the BIOS and turned the cpu fan monitoring to 'Ignore' and it booted my system up. Then when I signed into my pc the q-installer froze so I restarted my pc and it seemed to work and install all the necessary drivers. However the ethernet port didn't work I tried switching cables to see if that was the issue but no luck . I did reinstall some drivers and the ethernet worked for a short time until it just kinda quit not sure why . I ended up switching back to my old MSI mobo and everything works fine now. I really want to use my ASUS mobo because I plan on upgrading my CPU to a 9700k which my current mobo doesn't support. I'd like any help I can get. Do you think that if I try installing my mobo again it may work? Thanks!,0.071,0.824,0.104,0.7602,1,1

I just built a PC Ryzen 9 3900x working fine for a few hours after BIOS update the screen is just random colors unable to enter BIOS. x200B As the title says I built the PC seemed to be working fine did all the windows updates. Then I saw I had old BIOS I tried to update them using a USB flash drive downloading them from the ASUS website and then after finishing the PC shut down on its own no electricity issue nothing it just turned off on its own. From that point the PC starts and only shows random colors unable to enter BOIS again. What baffles me even more is that the motherboard indicates that there is an issue with the CPU as it has a red light from the manual red light means a problem with the CPU. I read about updating BIOS how you shouldn't turn off the PC etc but the PC shut down on its own. Can someone tell me what's going on as services in my country are really bad and if I don't find some kind of solution online I will end up replacing multiple parts.

2,gjnznv,ASUS,4,2020/05/15 07:01:04,Morning,ASUS Ux481 Zenbook duo non-touch main screen upgrade? Hey guys Hope y'all are well. So I recently bought the zenbook duo with the non-touch enabled main screen for about 1 200 I bought it near-mint condition with original packaging etc and it sells for about 1 600 new where I live sales tax included. i7 256gb 16gb RAM so not the top of the specs list but all right. I like the laptop but I'm not loving that the main screen isnt touch but I thought that it was just standard so had kinda given up. Now I'm seeing that the version with main screen that is touch enabled is going on sale for 1 500 excluding sales tax and I'm wondering if it would be worth it to splash the extra 3k for the main touch screen 1tb ssd. What do you guys think? I'm thinking maybe I'll sell the one I currently have because I don't see the touch version coming to my region any time soon and I did buy it for good value and then buy the new version from the US or something like that. Do you think the screen touch main screen and the extra storage is worth the money? I mean 3k is like 1/4 of what I paid for this laptop so I know it isnt a lot but considering that I'll use this for at least a few years it feels like maybe it will be a worthwhile investment?

2,gjlvv6,ASUS,2,2020/05/15 05:00:45,Night,Troubleshooting Crosshair VII Hero. So my setup has been fine since i built it around 8 months ago or so. I ordered some new 200mm case fans as they needed replacing. New fans come in i power down and install them. Simple stuff as ive been doing this for over 20 years now. I double check all my connections as i usually do in case something got unplugged. So i boot up with the new fans and bam! automatically powers down. I unplug the new fans and put the original ones back in. Same issue. After hours of troubleshooting taking everything apart nothing seemed to work then I realized i never tried clearing the cmos. For some reason clearing the cmos allowed it to boot into windows. BUT as soon as i restart or powerdown the issue instantly comes back until i clear the cmos again. Aside from dismantling the entire rig ive also tested the PSU in another setup and its fine ive also reflashed the bios and the issue still exists. Pretty sure these fans i bought shorted something out on the mobo. As all the other components inside the pc work in other rigs. Anyone have any insight or something i might have missed? TLDR PC works fine installed new fans PC shuts down with no q code to read. Clearing cmos fixes it until i reboot or shutdown problem comes back. Thanks for reading.,0.045,0.849,0.106,0.901,1,1
1,gjpsnd,ASUS,2,2020/05/15 08:35:30,Morning,ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo UX581 i9 9980hk major CPU cooler flaw I dont know if it's just an issue with mine some or all of these. But after using one for 3 months i have stumbled upon an odd issue. When it was new i like to benchmark my laptops to see how they perform at the same time i'll check CPU temps and how much they throttle. Generally use Cinebench R20 as it's a good all core load and will show issues. mine scored around 3300. not bad i've seen higher scores upto 3600 around the web and others similar scores to mine which seemed fine to me. now maybe 2-3 weeks later i noticed it was getting hotter quicker and throttling more. ran cinebench R20. 2800. let it cool and idle. 2850. very odd. at this point i could have sent it into asus but 6 weeks turn around time wasn't an option for me so i took it into my own hands. Decided to apply new thermal paste to the CPU GPU cooler. So i pulled the base off took the cooler off easy process FYI cleaned all the old paste off and applied some new one. i used - cooler master gel maker great stuff. similar to thermal grizzly Kryonaut. Turned it on. ran cinebench R20 3600. awesome. Undervolting decided to do it. Just to see what it can actually do. it's also safe so why not try. -0.120 was the sweat spot for mine. Cinebench R20 - 4020. brilliant. Fastfoward 3 weeks later ran cinebench R20... 3300. wtf? applied the undervolt. 3600. wtf? first thing i noticed was CPU Core 3 was hitting 96 deg while the rest sat around 75-85. That would cause the CPU to throttle down very quickly. it wouldn't even hit the 4.2Hz all core boost. so i thought it may have been an issue with my application. pulled the plate off nope looked good. cleaned it all and applied some more past. same results as previous. 3 weeks later. again noticed the CPU core 3 was running 15-20 deg hotter than the rest. WTF? cinebench scores where 3200 now. i believe the issue is the Cooling block. The CPU section of the block only has 2 screws on opposite corners not allowing even pressure over the whole CPU die. Thermal expansion and heat cycling over the few weeks of use must have moved the block enough to lose contact on the CPU die causing thermal issues. Also the laptop chassis could have made do with some more vents. or bigger. Awesome laptop well built. but flawed by the CPU/GPU cooler and not having enough airflow though the vents. x200B If anyone here is reading this and has the same laptop please post your thoughts on it. or run cinebenchR20 and share your results. TL DR. CPU/GPU cooler is a flawed design causing thermal issues.,0.089,0.799,0.112,0.848,1,1

I recently purchased a used Gladius II from Amazon and the USB dongle that came in the box is apparently for a ROG Fusion wireless headset and not the mouse I ordered. So that's pretty weird I guess the original person who returned the mouse to Amazon put the wrong dongle in the box as they look similar and it got passed on to me. Anyways on to the point of this post I was really hoping someone could help me. I thought even though it is a longshot it is possible that someone here has a broken Gladius II mouse lying around and a dongle for it collecting dust that I could buy. Either that or if anyone has any information on how to track down one of these I would be very grateful. I already spoke to Amazon they actually eventually gave me a refund for the mouse and didn't ask for it back and I spoke to Asus they said that they could not or would not help me.

7,giz1yp,ASUS,4,2020/05/14 05:29:54,Night,Did anyone manage to get Asus ROG STRIX-2070S-A8G to work in SLI? Is it a hidden feature? tldr solved - yes this feature is available on 2070S some benchies show its faster than 1080Ti. hope it helps you make your decisions! Apparently the PCB is based of the 2080 founder's edition and has this capability. I just got one and it definitely has the NVLink port ready. x200B Asus box/online specs mention nothing about this but i have since researched and found some sources talking about this NVIDIA carved the RTX 2070 Super out of the TU104 silicon by disabling an entire GPC worth CUDA cores leaving the chip with 2 560 out of its 3 072 CUDA cores enabled besides 160 TMUs 64 ROPs 320 Tensor cores and 40 RT cores. The memory subsystem is untouched. 8 GB of memory ticks at 14 Gbps and sits across a 256-bit wide GDDR6 memory interface churning out 448 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The GPU clock speeds are increased too with up to 1770 MHz GPU Boost frequency compared to 1620 MHz on the original RTX 2070. Another neat little perk of being based on the TU104 silicon is NVLink support which enables 2-way SLI. x200B Being based on the RTX 2080 the RTX 2070 Super gains a larger cooler a beefier PCB and support for a feature which Nvidia has phased out of their lower-end models SLI granting the RTX 2070 multi-GPU support. This enables Nvidia users to access multi-GPU RTX performance at much lower pricing than with their original RTX 2080 which is great news for multi-GPU enthusiasts. x200B x200B Can some one please help me make sense of what is happening? is this a feature which we will be able to unlock in the future? I understand Nvidia were looking to set SLI feature to premium cards only i.e. xx80s but I don't see a reason to block a feature which is already in the PCB. x200B I would appreciate any feedback and sorry if this is not the right place - i tried to do some research but wasn't able to find something conclusive. x200B edit1 port s/SLI/NVLink edit2 additional source edit3 this is closed - officially supported ,0.03,0.778,0.193,0.9965,1,1
1,gj9vi9,ASUS,19,2020/05/14 14:55:45,Afternoon,Does ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme Alpha have the best overclock performance among the TRX40 mobos? Hi. I have Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Xtreme mobo and worry about changing mobo to ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme Alpha . In 2019 December I bought TRX40 mobo Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Xtreme and ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme Alpha had the best VRM among the TRX40 mobo. Both of them have 16 phases and Infineon TDA21472 70A MOSFETs. As Gigabyte one has true phases VRM while ASUS one has teamed power stage design called 'dual output'? I judged Gigabyte mobo would have better overclock performance so I bought it. However ASUS Alpha now has Infineon TDA21490 90A superior to both non-Alpha's and Gigabyte's. But it still has teamed power stage design. x200B In this case would ASUS ROG Zenith II Extreme Alpha TRX40 have a more powerful overclock performance compared to Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Xtreme? Or not because of ASUS's non-true phase VRM design?,0.017,0.857,0.126,0.9626,1,1

2,girffz,ASUS,0,2020/05/13 19:57:15,Evening,Zephyrus G14 Refresh Rate Battery/AC SOLVED 1. Stardock Deskscapes 10 forced the platform timer resolution to the highest level even though it was not being used at all causing massive battery drain. 2. The screen remained at 120Hz even on battery despite the fact that in theory it's supposed to adjust automatically. SOLUTION 1 Platform Timer Found the problematic program with powercfg -energy. - Uninstall Deskscapes. SOLUTION 2 Refresh Rate Installed this script and followed the tutorial here In order to import the task scheduler tasks you need to specify a user for it to run under In order to use the script it must be edited for 120Hz instead of 144Hz toward the bottom . You must perform the edit BEFORE signing OR enable all not just signed PowerShell scripts on your computer. ORIGINAL POST I have a new Zephyrus G14. One reason I bought it is because reviews raved up and down about its battery life. My battery life is horrible think 5 hours on a full charge watching videos or surfing the web . For some inexplicable reason even when Armory Crate reports GPU is Power Saving and the system is on battery both Windows and Radeon settings report a 120Hz refresh rate. I can manually change this in Windows settings new Display settings - Advanced display settings - Display adapter properties for Display 1 but that seems kind of clunky. I installed Chipset Version V26.20.14001.64002. AnandTech had a similar problem though their specific issue was that the RTX2060 was waking up not the Vega GPU insisting on running at 120Hz while on battery.

2,gipcxl,ASUS,0,2020/05/13 17:44:00,Afternoon,Absolutely HORRIFIC RMA Experience! Looks like this is SUCH a common issue but I just gotta rant somewhere! Some months ago my PC suddenly turned off and wouldn't turn back on. After much troubleshooting I came to the conclusion the MB had gone bad. It was an Asus X470-F. There was no physical damage but it simply wouldn't power on. All other parts CPU Ram PSU GPU NVME etc worked in another PC. Contacted Asus. Sent it to them for RMA paid my own shipping of course.. . Few weeks later they sent me a 'new' MB. I could see that it was used... way more used than mine had been... but it looked in decent enough condition. Hooked everything up then went to put the NVME drive in. On taking off the M.2 heatsink first thing I noticed was the stand-off holding it up just... fell off. That seemed odd. Then I leaned in to put the NVME drive in... and was met with this Immediately contacted Asus again. Never turned the PC on no way I was risking my parts with the condition this MB was in. MB had been in its box up to the moment of being built the PC has no water cooled anything it was built in a room with no liquid allowed anywhere and again it was never even turned on though it was connected to a brand-new PSU and plugged into a very good UPS only to verify the status light turned on to show it was getting power... and then unplugged to put the NVME drive in . I explained all of this to them. They gave me a case number. This should have been a clue something was wrong since this probably should have been part of the same RMA. Few days later I'm asked to send pictures. Which... I already had. Sent them again explained I already had and explained the situation again . Said several times that this was a replacement board that Asus had sent me. And that it came to me from ASUS like this. They emailed me back advising I 'send it back to the place of purchase for a refund'... which again clued me in that they weren't understanding that they had sent me this board. Emailed them back once again reiterating that this was a replacement board from ASUS . Emailed me back that they were escalating the case. Received an email back today that simply said 'based on the damage shown this is not covered under our warranty. Sorry and good luck!' Immediately emailed them back a... very angry email AGAIN explaining that they sent me this board and it came to me like this then called. Yelled a lot at the poor phone support guy I know it's not his fault and he's just some dude trying to read off a script and he finally understood looking at the notes that everyone had been working based off the assumption that this was a new case. He then...... created a new case... and said he'd be escalating it. Put me on hold a few minutes then came back and said 'it looks like it was already escalated?' facepalm I explain that yes it had and they'd already contacted me back saying they weren't going to cover it because of the whole assumption this was a new case which was what we had been talking about this whole time . So now he's sent it back to escalation and I should hear from someone 'in the next 24-48 hours'... which... is what I keep getting only for the person it's escalated to not understanding this was a board sent to me like this from Asus . At this point it has been almost two months since I had a working PC. Asus please... I just want my PC working again! This MB was absolutely amazing and I just want it back. I had given up on Asus more than a decade ago because the only time I've had parts die were always Asus and I finally decided to give y'all another chance /,0.08,0.85,0.07,-0.9112,-1,0

For example if I move my finger in a straight line across the trackpad the cursor will move generally in the same direction but with erratic movements in random directions sometimes. When the issue presents itself I can hold my finger perfectly still on the trackpad and the cursor will spaz out a little. Sometimes even clicks/right clicks without me wanting it too. I've googled to the best of my ability and tried everything I found. The only thing that seemed to have any effect was updating the laptop firmware through Windows Update missed that somehow the first time round but the issue is still present just less frequently/severely. Things I've tried Updating the BIOS to the latest version Disabling any other mouse device drivers Updating/rolling back the trackpad drivers tried every single one I could find on the ASUS website as well as the Windows default ones Resetting to factory settings/reinstalling Windows Updating through Windows Update like I say this had a noticeable effect Some threads I've seen say there could be a grounding issue with ASUS trackpads on laptops with metal cases. Given the way the issue presents itself over time it kinda seems like this could be the case and the firmware update has just mitigated the issue slightly... Any things I should try before I RMA?

So in early March I bought an HP Envy 13 13-aq0003na and spent 1050 on it I needed a very light laptop with a dedicated GPU and was under 14 . It was my best option at the time . I originally planned to buy a laptop later this year to replace my crappy University-supplied Toshiba and my mid-2014 MacBook Pro but had to buy something early because of COVID-19. So the Zephyrus G14 will come out later this year and I would like some advice as to if I should sell my HP Envy 13 for a Zephyrus G14 GA401H/GA401II keeping in mind that I'll be selling at a significant loss. I'm currently a final year PhD student who is getting a non-funded extension due to COVID so money may be a bit of an issue. I do some 2D and 3D CAD work simulations and coding and I sometimes game so I'm interested to know if you guys think my HP Envy with the Nvidia MX250 is enough for games or if I should go for the G14 with the 1650/1650Ti? Should I sell my HP laptop and/or MacBook Pro for the Zephyrus G14 or should I just save my money If so do you think I either not buy it or buy it later on a sale? ?,0.049,0.865,0.087,0.888,1,1

The install was straightforward as I've come to expect from ASUS. My plan was to convert my current AC 1900 router and AC 1750 node into nodes. I've done this type of setup before without any issues with the 1900 as the router and the 1750 as the node. This time it was difficult to get either router set up as a node. They both repeatedly failed to sync with the 3100. Yes I reset each to factory default and updated the firmware...more than once! I was finally able to get the 1900 set up as a node but as soon as everything was working as it should I lost the ability to log into the 3100 GUI at all. I keep getting the following error x200B This site can’t be reached 192.168.1.1 took too long to respond. Try Checking the connection Checking the proxy and the firewall ERR CONNECTION TIMED OUT x200B The router and node as well as the entire network function as they should. I just have no way to currently manage any of it. I've tried logging in from my desktop laptop and phone but always get the same result crazy definition right? . I did not set up SSH access as I have never used it with a router. Other than doing a factory reset of the 3100 and starting over any suggestions? I was planning on calling ASUS customer service tomorrow but figured I'd get a much quicker response here. Thanks for any help Jay,0.059,0.879,0.062,0.2028,1,1

I believe that as it's working MacOS is recognizing the ZenScreen as an Ink Tablet as a new icon appeared in the System Settings so it receives the clicks from it and it relays them to whenever the mouse cursor happen to be. Do you know of any way I could fix this or force the clicks to always happen on the second screen? If not the touchscreen would be mostly useless to me because I'd need to move the mouse cursor to the second screen to click thus defeating the whole point of it.

1,gicdun,ASUS,13,2020/05/13 06:36:26,Night,X570-P owners comment on chipset fan? Just wondering if the chipset fan works as I have read that it can be noisy even at idle? I am interested in this board but I think the chipset fan can't be controlled e.g. by any software not even in the bios . I don't know if it matters what hardware you use. I think I read some claims that certain graphics cards might help as their fans might help the chipset fan? Supposedly Gigabyte and maybe MSI have software that can control the chipset fan - e.g. fan stop? I think the X570-P is probably the best budget X570 but a noisy fan you can't easily control would be a deal breaker for me. The alternative motherboards are the Asrock x570 phantom gaming 4 Msi x570 a-pro and Gigabyte x570 UD. Not much competition for the X570-P but if any of those offer control of the chipset fan that is crucial.,0.049,0.724,0.227,0.9845,1,1

1,gi25ai,ASUS,3,2020/05/12 18:25:16,Afternoon,Breaking the 5 GHz barrier Excuse me if I sound like an idiot I'm not super versed on the ins and outs of overclocking. I have a ROG Strix Z390-E and an i7-9700k. No matter what I do I can't seem to exceed 4.9 GHz. At 4.9 GHz my system is rock stable and I can run it for days without a crash or core dump. Bump it up to 5 GHz and my system core dumps like every 5 minutes. It's immediately unusable. Temps 4.9 GHz in Intel XTU are around 70 C. I've tried using AI Tweaker which normally chooses a 38% to 41% overclock 5.0 to 5.1 GHz at a cooler score of around 160 to 170. Without fail this causes my system to become unusable with frequent core dumps. I've tried using AI Suite 3 which sometimes chooses a 4.9 GHz overclock and sometimes a 5.0 GHz. If it chooses the 5.0 GHz overclock my system becomes immediately unusable. The only way I can guarantee stability is to manually set my core ratio to 49 for a 4.9 GHz overclock. So my questions are mainly what's going on? I thought that instability increases gradually as core ratio is increased and temperature increases as voltage is increased? Right? So how come everything is perfect at 4.9 GHz 1.32V I think and everything immediately falls completely apart at 5.0 GHz whatever voltage AI Tweaker / AI Suite chooses . I feel like 70 C is pretty cool for a max temp do I have some temp overhead? Again I have a very limited knowledge of this stuff sorry in advance. PC ,0.078,0.802,0.121,0.8729,1,1

This is a brand new ASUS tuf laptop its the 505DV one the keyboard works in the bios menu so it’s not broken but it stops working as soon as the windows log in screen starts. Windows isn’t even picking up the keyboard as a device in device manager I tried installing drivers and the works nothing. I am currently doing a full system reset to see if that’ll fix it but asus customer support is of literally no use right now as no one can actually give suggestions on how to fix it.

1,ghupsk,ASUS,5,2020/05/12 11:34:33,Morning,Specific drivers order? Hey everyone I repost this from 10 minutes ago because I realized I didn't choose a flair only to find out there are no flairs on here... - - Anyway I recently got an ASUS ROG G731GV aaand figured out how shitty faulty most of their software and drivers are even some spelling mistakes that aren't supposed to be in such a huge brand's software... So my question is in what order do I install the armoury crate uwp its services rog live services ALSO WHICH LIVE SERVICE?! regular one without NB in the name or the NB one? what's the difference? they keyboard hotfix and most importantly the refresh rate service and game first because those two it doesn't seem I can get up and running even tho they are listed in the model's drivers list Do I need to install older versions to make them work?? Also how do I install them? Do I use the .bat files or not? Do I install them as an admin or nah? Every time I install them I get a different error... At this point the panel overdrive does not show up in the armoury crate uwp at all and the game first fails to find culture files I've been fiddling with the drivers for 2 days straight trying out different order and ways to install them by .bat or not as an admin or not and I got them all to work just once for about 15 minutes till I restarted the laptop which caused both panel overdrive and game first to disappear I'm honestly at the brink of going mad at this point,0.077,0.888,0.035,-0.8849,-1,0

1,ghqr99,ASUS,7,2020/05/12 08:23:41,Morning,ARGB issue with PRIME x570 motherboard I just built a new PC with an ASUS Prime x570 Pro motherboard. My case has ARGB fans but they don't show up in any software despite extensive troubleshooting. They are connected via the 3-pin Gen2 ARGB port at the bottom of the motherboard. I then bought a cheap generic ARGB strip kit that uses the same connector and those don't even light up much less appear in software to control them. I'm working this from the fan end of it too but I'm leaning toward the problem being the motherboard which works flawlessly outside of this problem given the problem with the strips.

The other day I left the computer unplugged and powered down but when I tried to plug it in the next morning and use it there was no indicator light on the laptop that it was receiving power and the battery was completely dead. Normally if there is a battery issue I would imagine the laptop itself would still receive power. I used a multi-meter on the AC adapter and it's still reading 19.8 V so the AC adapter should still be fine. The only thing I'm thinking is that somehow the contact connector between the AC adapter and the power receptable on the laptop somehow isn't good and thus it isn't transferring power. Didn't drop it at all or anything so there's no reason why it would stop working suddenly that I can think of. Anyone have any suggestions? I'm out of warranty and I have no feel for how good Asus repair services are or how costly,0.151,0.825,0.023,-0.9725,-1,0

I have mine for a year now and during that time it was sent for repair because of a mobo defect. Now everything is fixed however i am very much concerned about my temps. I am nowhere near the temps shown on the tech reviews on my laptop in youtube. I even tried playing in an airconditioned room with cooler stands and all. On idle it runs about 50-60 on both cpu and gpu. On gaming gpu tops at 86 while cpu goes to 90 even on games that are not that heavy. I have already tried undervolting the gpu which worked out fine but my cpu temps are still going 90 plus. I was thinking they did poorly on the maintenance.

Bought this mobo in January. If I download the driver package from the Asus website there are a bunch of install files - i always click asussetup by default after extracting and run as administrator. I get a small white installing box a prompt pops up saying I need to restart pc which I do. It seems to have installed the drivers and sonic studio/radar. The drivers do seem to work - but there is slight crackling in some games when using dolby. digital output with Siberia 840 headset - firmware is up to date Furthermore I have no audio manager aside from the windows 10 sound control panel. Sonic studio crashes upon opening as well. So i cannot use case audio jacks or control audio in any way? thinking realtek HD manager or supremefx which i had with my strix x99 mobo - no issue ever. If I uninstall the audio drivers and revert to windows standard - no crackling BUT i still have no audio managecontrol. So my question Can i just download the standard realtek drivers from their site and use as normal and get full use of mobo features and some sort of audio manager or do I NEED to utilise the mobo specific drivers and sonic studio. If i do how do i get it to work as intended? x200B I'm pretty good with this sort of thing but audio drivers look like a real deep dive!! Thanks in advance.,0.048,0.873,0.079,0.8858,1,1

With a 60W USB C laptop I can reduce my backpack weight significantly and make this an ultraportable performance laptop that I can carry around with me. I do understand that there are limitations as in I won't expect the laptop to charge if I play games with a 60W USB C Charger not that I'm going to do that anyway .

1,gh5yom,ASUS,2,2020/05/11 09:49:33,Morning,Asus TUF A15 fan control doesn't seem ideal Hi I got a new Asus TUF A15 a couple days ago overall very happy with it. The fan speed logic seems like it could be better though 1 -- The minimum fan speed seems to be 2200 RPM when it's not stopped. This seems unnecessarily fast for a minimum and it produces a pretty noticeable amount of noise. Also when the fan starts spinning from a stop it blasts up to 3000 RPM before it quiets down to 2200 RPM. When I'm using the laptop in silent mode it will cycle between being completely silent fan stopped then occasionally loud when the fan starts then quieter for a while 2200 RPM then silent again. Surely it would be better overall if then fan just ran slower all the time like 1000 RPM or so? 2 -- When in silent mode the fan will often start spinning when the temperatures are only in the mid-40s and start spinning faster when the temperatures are around 50. How does this make sense? The laptop is designed for gaming with temperatures in the 80s and sometimes 90s. So why is silent mode trying to keep the temperatures below 50? Surely it could let them get up to at least like 60 before spinning up the fans?,0.02,0.78,0.2,0.9899,1,1

6,ggxiv9,ASUS,2,2020/05/11 00:10:37,Night,Asus Tuf VG32VQ review Hey all I wanted to do a review of the VGVQ because I have not seen much posted about it and the only reviews I can find are sponsored sites or dedicated hardware review sites. TLDR for the current price of 450 shipped I could not recommend this monitor enough. For a 1440p gaming experience this thing delivers. x200B Lets start off with the good The panel ships with both HDMI and Displayport cables in the box this is a move I found particularly wise because at this price point many people may be upgrading from an HDMI only display and might not even have a displayport cable lying around. VESA standard support supports both 75x75 and 100x100. 144hz with Freesync and G-sync compatibility. Also supports Asus' elmb which some find to be nauseating but I don't personally have any issue. Asus advertises 1ms response time real world this feels more like 3-5ms but at true QHD this is expected. Shockingly thin bezels. Good screen curvature. Price to performance is the best I have seen in this level of monitor speaking only to the brand new market . HDR while not great ability allows you to play HDR games and content. x200B The Bad Out of the box color and brightness was atrocious. To properly calibrate this display and get a brightness that could be seen without damaging my retinas I had to spend around 40 minutes tinkering around with windows settings and monitor settings. HDR is more of a gimmick on this monitor it allows windows to play HDR content but 400 ish nits of brightness is nowhere near a good HDR viewing experience. This is more of a personal gripe than anything but the lack of USB ports on this monitor is probably one of the things that cause this monitor to be ignored by most consumers and reviewers. x200B Closing thoughts I have been using this monitor for about a week for productivity gaming and media consumption. I am genuinely impressed with this monitor it competes directly with its higher priced Asus ROG 32 cousin. if your budget is around 500 for a monitor this one will not disappoint.,0.058,0.794,0.148,0.9882,1,1

1,ggy2o5,ASUS,2,2020/05/11 00:59:33,Night,Did I kill my Vivobook? Desperate college student in need of help. Hey everyone. I have a 14 ASUS Vivobook Flip 2-in-one tablet/laptop that's giving me issues. It runs Windows 10 on 64 bit and Intel Core i5. It's about two years old at this point. A few hours ago it was working just fine. Then something under the right hand panel just under my keyboard started making a weird gurgling or churning sound. Didn't pay much attention to it because everything was fine for the next few minutes. I was working on a scholarship application and listening to some music on Google Chrome but when I tried to open a new tab in the window I was working from I got stuck on Waiting for cache... for a really long while. I decided to restart my computer since it seemed like I was disconnected from our WiFi network. Restarted it just fine programs like Chrome Discord Slack and Microsoft Teams took a bit longer to boot up but it was whatever. Managed to reconnect to our network by moving my laptop closer to our router. Finished the scholarship application in around 20 minutes. Then did a speed test on Xfinity's website and speedtest.net. Results were typical. Moved back to the living room where I was working before. Tried to do the speed tests again no luck. Tried to restart my computer again. Programs took even longer to boot up. Fuck it decided to do a system restore to 5 days ago and see if that helps. Tried doing so 3 times at 2 different checkpoints besides the one my laptop automatically created on May 4. This all happened around 9 30 P.M. and I've been continuously running system restores and restarting my laptop for nearly 6 hours now with no progress made. Now only my cursor works. Everything beyond my login screen is basically unresponsive. Every time I try to run a system restore I get a message saying it failed to extract a file associated with Norton Antivirus. I Googled it and saw that turning off or disabling your antivirus might help but I can't even access my control panel at this point because of how slow everything is. Did I fuck up my hard drive crack it shift it out of place etc. ? I've done a lot of traveling with this laptop and it's never given me issues quite like this. Did I somehow damage whatever is under the right side of the keyboard? Should I seek a professional's help? I have quite a few final projects due for school in the coming days and I would really appreciate getting some help so I don't have to use my dad's laptop.

I use the Asus B450-f Gaming Motherboard and in the manual it says the primary DIMM slots are A2 and B2 but whenever I insert them into the slots I noticed that only my A2 RAM stick lights up. I'm using the Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro sticks at 3200mhz and it's not like my motherboard doesn't recognize that there's two RAM sticks in there because it works and I have my full 16GB but I've tested this out and the only time my RAM sticks light up is when they're both in A1 and A2 both B1 and B2 don't allow my RAM to light up for some reason. If anyone can help me I'd really appreciate it because it'd suck if I get more RAM and only half of it lights up not to mention I don't want to sacrifice performance just so my computer looks pretty.

I got this machine in mid-March from Best Buy and have barely been able to use it because of these issues. The first thing I noticed is insane high pitched coil whine. A quick Google search informed me it goes away if I use the LED backlight on the keyboard... Okay that's weird but okay I guess. The big issue is after about three minutes in any game the computer starts to throttle very harshly down to live five frames per second in most instances and this throttle repeats itself every fifteen seconds or so even on the lowest possible graphics and resolution settings. What is going on here? And does anybody know how to fix it? I've been scouring tech support forums and Reddit threads looking for solutions and reasoning and I've tried them all. I've updated the BIOS first to 208 back when I got it and now to 302 since it released hoping for a better result. I haven't removed the black film on the heat pipes or fan covers because I don't want to void my warranty. I'm using all the ASUS drivers from their site I have the 'Armoury Crate' software installed along with 'ASUS Live Service' and all the other stuff that it seems is essential to even get the laptop to run using its GPU I've tried every setting in Armoury Crate...

1,ggo7os,ASUS,0,2020/05/10 13:34:32,Afternoon,Can’t figure this out please help! First off thank you to anyone who can contribute in any way to this this has been baffling me like crazy... Ok so I built a ROG Strix 570-e system with a 3900x and a 2080 ti and when I first went to boot it I noticed it wouldn’t start. All I got were two flashing red lights on the GPU. I couldn’t find a fix for this so I decided to just try and check the connections and what not. Well that’s what I did... then magically everything just turned on the second time I tried to boot it. Ok so at this point I thought maybe there was a loose connection or something. This was 3 days ago. Today I finish my cable management and the computer boots up as normal no issues or anything like that. However I decide to test out the USB Type C connection in the front since that’s the only thing I hadn’t tested and it caused a USB power surge or something. At this point I’m freaking out thinking what the heck something is wrong with the mobo. So I shut down the computer and boom here comes those flashing red lights on the GPU again. The computer won’t turn on so I decided to unplug the USB type C connector from mobo to try that. BOOM that made the computer boot. At this point you’re probably thinking like I am that it’s the USB port or something right? Well I shut down the computer and plugged in the USB Type C cable into the motherboard and I get those flashing red lights on the GPU again. Again the computer won’t boot. So I decided let me unplug and replug the GPU power cables and check that. To my surprise the computer booted up and the USB type C port now seems to work perfectly fine when I plug in my iPhone. What in the world is going on? Should I be worried? Has anyone ever had this type of issue? I don’t want to think that if I move my PC this will start happening again or something. Super confused and would really appreciate any advice on the matter. I contacted ASUS support but they said they couldn’t help me over the phone because of Clovid-19 there’s not enough reps. So I went to the chat and after 3 hours of waiting I gave up. This is my first experience with ASUS support and so far I’m hating everything about it.,0.044,0.87,0.087,0.9184,1,1

3,ggdrme,ASUS,4,2020/05/10 03:19:39,Night,Irks with Armoury Crate/Armoury II ROG peripherals This is more of a vent than an actual ask for help but any advice would be welcome appreciated I'll have built my rig a year ago in September and as a uni student with limited funds I've built it up steadily when I've had the spare cash. So far I'm running the Maximus Hero XI Black Ops 4 edition mobo Ryujin 240mm AIO Strix RTX 2070 Gaming OC graphics card all from Asus. The case is NZXT's H500i memory is Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 3200MHz Also running an i5 9600k CPU but that's being swapped for an i9 9900k at some point in the near future . For peripherals I'm using the ROG Spatha Strix Scope RGB also from Asus. Don't get me wrong when the lighting works for my setup it looks beautiful I'll try to include some pics of my rainbow unicorn barf below but throughout this build I've had several persistent issues with either component design or software that have made using my lighting effectively a bit of a chore 1 Parts don't light up properly on startup if at all sometimes. When I boot up my PC it sometimes takes a few seconds for the lighting to come on and sync up with everything else it's to be expected as that's just a given when a system starts up. But more often than not at this point either peripherals stay unlit or my RAM doesn't sync up with the rest of my lighting meaning I then have to go into armoury crate to either set the lighting scheme or manually re-sync components that don't do it for themselves which feels unnecessary for a system that should work as intended. 2 Parts don't light up properly on shutdown/sleep. I love that I can have a little hint of lighting coming from my computer even when I'm not using it as it gives my room a little more character too and thank's to Corsair's iCue platform my RAM can have lighting effects running specifically for when the computer's on standby. However since the only Asus part of my build that lights up on standby/shutdown is my mobo and the lighting effects don't sync up in these states I tend to keep it on a static red scheme goes with the red in my case too . Lately though my mobo has taken to staying on rainbow mode even though it's set to the static setting in armoury crate which can be very distracting when trying to watch TV or sleep. 3 Parts have obscenely bright LEDs that I don't want or can't turn off. This applies in majority to the Strix RTX graphics card which has a pair of LED indicator lights on the 8 pin connector ports to show they're in use. The graphics card has a physical LED on/off switch on it but it doesn't affect these tiny pinpricks which for some reason have enough power to light up the entire inside of my case on their own steam just the aurasync LEDs that I want running when the PC's running. Would it really have cost so much to make these LEDs work with the POST only setting in BIOS and give you the option to disable them when the PC's off for the same reason of just how damn distracting they are when trying to sleep? And why so fricking bright?! I could light the bottom of the Marianas trench with how bright these 2 little suckers are!! 4 Ryujin's OLED screen doesn't want to show what you ask it to. Having a mini OLED screen in your PC that can show animated ROG symbols System info such as fan speed CPU temps etc. My personal favourite is a stroke of brilliance that really adds to the functionality and eye-catching factor of one of these builds. I love being able to glance at my tower when playing a game just to make sure I'm not melting my CPU. But I hate that half of the times I turn my PC on I have to go into armoury crate to manually reset this feature given it has to reload when I do this I can only assume it's some sort of firmware crash that causes this . It's a pain for the same reason as point number 1. I know Armoury Crate is a beta app but the fact you can't use the screen without it as far as I'm aware means that this part should at least be functionally polished before they rolled the product out onto shelves. 5 Lighting profiles/layouts don't always load on app loading. Another damn good idea imo being able to set lighting and keyboard profiles to trigger when starting a set /series of app s is awesome... When it works as intended. You're going on Spotify? We gotcha your lights are set to music mode . Playing LoL are we? There's your key settings sorted ... Except when it has a brain-fart and you have to try to get into Armoury crate from a full screen game to change profiles since setting it to function on app loading seems to override the ability to bind it to a hotkey one of the reasons I bought the Scope in the first place . Also why did they remove the Smart lighting setting The one that used Red/Yellow/Green lighting to indicate CPU/GPU temps/usage from profiles? That was a handy feature for early access games like Satisfactory to indicate just how heavy the game was running on your rig. 6 ROG Spatha doesn't work with Armoury Crate yet . This will probably get fixed/added later on in Armoury Crate's beta roadmap. But AC is supposed to be the 'one app for all your ROG needs' solution to having loads of lighting on your rig isn't it? Because it only works with Armoury II at the moment this means that the Spatha can't take part in the flashy lighting sequences my other components got going on leading it to stick out like the awkward kid at the school dance Totally not speaking from experience there . This also raises another issue that will be addressed in the final point of this rant 7 Armoury II Armoury Crate DO NOT play well with each other... AT ALL. Since my Scope can share its lighting sync with the rest of my build naturally I have it set in sync with the rest of my rig except the aforementioned Spatha poor thing . However this also means that while the Scope's synced with the rest of my rig in Armoury Crate the bouncer won't let me into Armoury II to adjust the Spatha's settings such as thumb button settings etc. . This is infuriating as it means I first have to go to AC to unsync my keyboard so I can then go into AII to adjust my button bindings still winds me up that they didn't add individual entries for the thumb buttons to act as individual intended thumb buttons instead requiring either a keyboard or function binding which can make it difficult to set up for some games looking at you Satisfactory and other functions. Now I can hear the comments of just use Aura Sync AII instead of AC it'll make your life a load easier rushing in but the engineer in me wants to see AC really function as intended because it DOES have the potential to be a powerful tool for enthusiasts as well as act as a great platform for future innovative leaps that Asus could make in the future. However it also begs the question of if it works with AS why doesn't AII work or even be allowed to work as it gets disabled with AC?! Allowing it to function in conjunction with AC would surely be more streamlined than forcing you to unsync from one to gain access to the other. If it's an issue with the settings of one app interfering with the other simply disable access to the peripherals using the other app to control the settings and continue supporting the ones that aren't rather than disabling a whole app. I am not a Software engineer Mechatronics Robotics are my forte so I can't begin to grasp at the technical aspects and growing pains creating and supporting this sort of program is probably challenged by. However prior experience has taught me that writing programs can be a major headache when you have to isolate and fix/remove bugs that can break the intended function of that code so most of these gripes will probably be ironed out as AC leaves beta. Certain design choices by the engineers at Asus however do beg the question of how rushed their production cycles must be to meet market deadlines if they are missing logical leaps that would make user experience far more enjoyable. Their products are high quality with some innovative twists to the design but I wish those innovations wouldn't come at cost to the quality of the ecosystem running the show. I'm sure garnering a good reputation for reliability with the user base is more profitable than pumping out new designs every quarter but they still have a decent way to go before they get my full 5 stars. x200B TLDR I decided to gripe about my main windups with the Asus products I'm using in hopes that someone will learn from my mistakes. P.S If you managed to read all the way through this post I hope you enjoyed it had a laugh. I'm still working on my build to get it to ROG perfection but for now here's a few pics of my setup as it currently is. Please also feel free to suggest any build tips or correct my spelling ,0.048,0.84,0.113,0.9991,1,1

I bought myself a new monitor yesterday Asus TUF Gaming VG27BQ and when I plug the PCs HDMI or Display Port into the monitor I just get an error stating there is no signal. However if I plug the monitor into my Xbox One S HDMI slot it works perfectly. I'm not very great with the techy side of things so I'm unsure where the issue could begin so I can only apologise if I mention anything irrelevant here. My current monitor is a BenQ GL2450-B which I have had 0 issues with. Unsure if the resolution or refresh rate difference is an issue with the Asus being 2560x1440 / 165hz max and the BenQ being 1920x1080 / 76hz max .

New to reddit Last year my laptop got stolen and now Its gotten to the point where I really need to save up to get a new one for life and work. I've been trying to do a lot of research into what laptop I want to get so I can pick one and know what to save up for but I have a learning disability that makes me unable to comprehend numbers which makes looking at lab top specs really really overwhelming and Im also just not the most tech savy on top of that my previous laptop was a macbook if that gives any implication on what I know about laptops . I started looking at gaming laptops first Im not an intense gamer I play ps4 and nintendo regularly but casually and want to start getting into some PC games and eventually twitch stream for fun as well so I figured since I have to save up anyway I could get a gaming laptop and kill two birds with one stone. I travel a lot for work so Id need something not extremely bulky and I have to run programs like photoshop and video editors. I deduced that ASUS seems the best way to go and originally I found the ASUS ROG Zepheryus g14 its got amazing reviews and seems to be really well rounded for my needs of travelling/photoshop/games/ etc but it hasnt been announced when it will released in Canada and Im worried it will be a long time because of Covid when I can't wait too terribly long since work never stops so I thought I would ask what people thought on some other ASUS gaming laptops I was looking at such as the following x200B -Asus Rog Strix -Asus Rog Strix 3 -Asus ROG -Asus ROG Zepheryus thin x200B Does anyone know when the g14 might come to Canada? If you were me and couldnt get the G14 which other laptop would you get and why? Any input is appreciated!

I recently changed my MOBO and CPU to - ROG Crosshair VIII Hero - AMD 3900X due to my previous intel CPU failure. x200B I have a few issues with this setup. The first one is with my cooling Kraken X61 I plugged the pump connector to AIO PUMP socket and fans to CPU FAN and OPT CPU FAN. In BIOS the AIO PUMP is not recognized but the CAM software shows it's working. However the temperature fluctuates every few seconds between 32 - 50 degrees in idle according to hwmonitor . x200B The other issue is the cpu voltage - in BIOS settings the only extreme tweaking option that is enabled is the xmp. The rest of them are set to auto. BIOS shows that cpu voltage is set to 1.475v ! . But in cpu-z it shows around 1.3v.

The setup is to have my AiMesh router upstairs where the CAT-5 plug is have one node directly downstairs Living Room and one node further away downstairs Bedroom . When I first set the whole thing it everything worked great. But after a day I noticed that devices connected to the furthest way Bedroom node was not getting any internet connection. It only happens to certain devices on that node. For example yesterday it was my Samsung TV which WiFi receiver is working fine as I connected it to my mobile hotspot and it worked while my iPhone works then stops. To fix that I switched the RT-AC68Us and then both my Samsung TV and iPhone worked - not really sure why that fixed it but it was late so I accepted it and went to bed. Today I checked my Amazon Echo Show which is closest to the Bedroom node and it appears to have the same problem as my TV yesterday - it connects to WiFi and shows strong signal but no internet connection. I have not turned on any filtering or blocking. I like not having to switch to different WiFi networks so I didn't want to just use the RT-AC68Us in repeater mode but the unreliable internet connection is driving me nuts. Here is a quick shot of what my setup is like Here is the Bedroom node with 3 devices connected Would like help on where to start troubleshooting this... interestingly enough the closer Living Room node doesn't appear to have much issues.

I got my Gladius 2 mouse a couple days ago and the Strix MX Cherry keyboard and Balteus Qi should arrive this weekend. Recently I plugged in my Gladius and installed Aura Sync on my fully up-to-date Windows laptop. It’s been buggy at best. It randomly stops lighting effects and seems to have a mind of its own. I read that I should try Armory Crate as that is essentially the ASUS hub for all devices moving forward. So I uninstalled Aura Sync and tried Armory Crate. It detected and updated my mouse drivers and then the mouse disappeared from AC. After several complete uninstalls that included wiping out all installation/program files leftover and several reinstalls from both the ASUS download site and the MS Store it still fails to detect the mouse. This concerns me enormously. I have a ton more ASUS components on the way which will have to run through Armory Crate for fine tuning and lighting effects. Should I abort this build and send this stuff back? Maybe Gigabyte Corsair would be better?,0.033,0.919,0.048,0.6072,1,1

A few years back part of the bezel that covers one of the hinges bent a bit and the laptop hinge would scrape and pop against the bent bezel every time I opened and closed the laptop. A friend of mine coincidentally also had a Q551LN that she was scrapping for parts because it wasn't working I should clarify it had nothing to do with the display so I swapped out the bezel-screen assembly from hers because the bezel was in a much better condition. While swapping out the bezel-screen assembly I failed to disconnect the battery before plugging in the video cable from the new screen into the motherboard. Upon powering up the laptop the screen backlight would not illuminate the screen. Holding a flashlight to the screen would show the screen image very faintly. I read online that can be a result of either a blown backlight potentially caused by failure to disconnect the battery before swapping screens or a bad inverter board. Not wanting to spend the money on a new screen to test it I shelved the laptop for a couple years. x200B Fast forward to the present. I recently ordered a new screen just the screen not the bezel from eBay and swapped the old screen out with the new one. This time I made sure to disconnect the battery before performing the swap. After I plugged everything back in I discovered I had the same issue as before where images of the desktop and cursor can be faintly seen while shining a flashlight on the screen. x200B Doing some searching online I read that inverter board are only used for LCD screens because LED screens don't consume enough power to require an inverter. Looking at the specs for the screen I ordered on eBay it seems the screen for the Q551L is indeed an LED and in fact the Q551LN may not have an inverter board at all. Since I know it's not the screen or the video cable what else could be causing this issue? I don't have any multimeters or tech tools to narrow it down to individual components on the motherboard but I was hoping somebody could point me in the right direction so I can do more research on it. x200B Thanks for your time.,0.021,0.941,0.038,0.7717,1,1

I have only 2 mainstream options of memory to pair with my 3700X ASUS X570 GAMING PRO both on the gray market imported without taxes Ballistix Elite DDR4-3600 UDIMM C16 16GB 2x8GB sticks - BLE8G4D36BEEAK - around 155 dollars free shipping . G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4-3600MHz C18 16GB 2x8GB sticks - F4-3600C18D-16GTZN - around 170 dollars free shipping . i was about to pick the C16 version for 20 dollars less but the exchange rate rose dramatically after some stupid shit our president did on the past days and they all sold out. I understand the differences between C16 and C18 and I really don't mind a RGB-less stick but i don't know which chip brand is better MICRON 1st or SK HYNIX 2nd and how it would impact my gaming and daily tasks. also I have an official store selling the HyperX Predator RGB DDR4- 3200MHz C16 16GB 2x8GB sticks - HX432C16PB3AK2/16 for around 150 dollars . this particular model is NOT SUPPORTED on que QVL but it's RGB-less counterpart is. do you think it would work? so it all comes down to 3 questions 1. which model should i pick and why? 2. how much would the C18 impact on my daily performance? 3. would the hyperX be a good deal even 3200MHz C16? would it work on my ASUS mobo? thank you all in advance.

I would really love to get a Zenscreen Touch but my main use case would be with a stylus. Essentially I want to use it with my non-touchscreen Win10 laptop as a secondary screen for markups basic diagrams note taking etc. Essentially turn it into a large Surface Pro albeit tethered to my laptop . I'm not an artist so I don't need lots of pressure sensitivity etc. but I would still need a stylus to be more than 1 of those rubber-end sticks. I have a Note 10 and love the stylus so I would love to replicate that experience on a bigger screen so I can productively use it for work. Thanks,0.036,0.815,0.148,0.955,1,1

I have the g.skill trident z rgb RAM and remembered I had trouble getting them to work when I first built the PC but I knew that using Aura Sync I was able to control them. Upon trying to boot up Aura Sync I got the error Aura Service is currently unavailable . Since then I have tried everything I could think of. Numerous Reddit threads and youtube videos where every solution does nothing to fix this issue. I've tried a fresh download downloading an earlier version unblocking the file before extracting it rebooting my PC and unplugging it reinstalling the RAM using Task Manager to try and manually start the service but absolutely nothing changes the outcome. At one point I even gave up on Aura sync and tried to use the g.skill software but that does nothing to change the RAM. As of now I have no clue what to do and the only progress I've made was somehow freezing the default rainbow effect to where my RAM is stuck on half green and half yellow upon rebooting the PC once. Any help is extremely appreciated. x200B TL DR Keep getting the Aura service is currently unavailable and have tried everything I could think of to fix it.,0.057,0.868,0.075,0.7986,1,1

ASUS Prime X470-pro Is this the forum to get help from Asus on motherboards? I have a R5 3600 cpu 16gb 3200 ballistix LT sport and a Strix GTX960 in my ASUS Prime X470-pro and the newest BIOS. If I load optimised default settings in the BIOS it will set the ran to run a 2400 and the GPU fan will spin fast and loud for around 8 seconds before the screen comes on and the PC boots up. The GPU didn't do this on my old Asus P6T motherboard. So what's happening? Is this when memory training is happening? If I activate DOCP in the BIOS the RAM runs at 3200 and Post/boot is the same most times but sometimes it gets stuck at the loud GPU fan stage and never boots until I press the reset button several times or hold the power button until it turns off and then turn it on again it might do the 8 seconds loud part and then boot. I've been experimenting with the Ryzen DRAM calculator and with 3200 safe settings all entered in the BIOS sometimes the PC will boot very fast with the GPU fan only spinning for a instant before turning off and the screen coming on. Which is a tantalising glimpse of how good it can be but if I turn it off and switch off at the wall the next boot will have the loud GPU period of slow POST.,0.009,0.909,0.081,0.9521,1,1

1,gfjkom,ASUS,0,2020/05/08 17:18:32,Afternoon,What Are My RepaiReplacement Options For A Laptop Without A Screen Asus N550JX ? Pictures x200B The laptop's screen and housing are completely removed from the laptop so it only has the keyboard. It is just the keyboard and touchpad with the screen completely missing. The hookups/wires for the original screen are still there. Works fine when plugged into an external monitor. Here are the options I was looking at 1 Cost 80- 200 Buying the parts and repairing myself. This one stumps me because it is a touchscreen laptop. I have never repaired one of those only smartphone screens. Going here gives me the option for LCD Screen and Touch Digitizer. If someone has a definitive answer for this one then I would have no problem putting all the pieces together. So far the only thing I know definitely is that I will need the LCD back covehinges combo and the LCD screen 1920x1080p glossy/matte options . But I don't know if the touchscreen digitizer is required. 2 Cost 40 Portable monitors. This is actually not a bad idea and never heard of them until now. It's an intriguing enough option that I would consider selling off my main computer 2600k and running an egpu setup with the Asus N550JX. Then when I needed to work from the living-room just bring the portable monitor along. It's ghetto looking but it would work . Picked up a USB powered one from AOC for cheap and it works perfectly. If it came down to it could a 3D print housing be made to permanently attach it to the laptop? The only con about this is I am still not 100% sure how this would work. Does the portable monitor need the main screen to be attached? Are there touchscreen options available and do they work? Is a portable monitor a quality downgrade from the original monitor? And finally the expense of an egpu that can handle an FE Vega seems unlikely at under 200 so am I missing something there? 3. Cost 49.99 Are there wireless displays that I can use? This would actually be the most convenient but the last I even heard of this type of setup was with Intel wireless display. I think that's dead. This is a bad idea for multiple reasons after looking at the current technology screenbeam . And now that I have the portable monitor it really seems pointless. If I am wrong please correct me. 4. Cost Arm and a leg Just send it to a local repair shop. Wouldn't mind I know a few mom and pop stores that could use some business right now. Did this and wow would not recommend. Even the most basic of questions was answered with 'Bring it in we don't know until we run a PAID diagnostic'. It was like talking to a Skyrim NPC that only had 3 lines. Extras In the event that I go with option 2 is there a 3d printing place I can contact to make a clip on cover for the exposed part for where the monitor used to be? That way it looks like a smart keyboard rather than a broken laptop with no screen. What would be the cost and what information would they need to complete the project?

The reason I found why Aura Sync was not running is because of Valorant. If you want to play Valorant you also need to install their anti-cheat software Riot Vanguard. Riot Vanguard will block certain files upon starting up your pc. It is dumb and annoying but I believe Riot is trying to limit how many files it will block. That file that was blocked might have been something that Aura Sync requires. I personally don't play Valorant because I was never really interested in FPS games so I simply uninstalled Riot Vanguard and it Aura Sync worked fine afterwards.

However after drying it out over night it's mostly been fine - it just seemed that the battery was shot as I could no longer unplug my laptop but the computer itself worked just as it usually did. Whenever I had to move the laptop from room to room I'd put it in Sleep mode unplug move rooms plug it in again and press a key to wake it up. This worked fine though sometimes if I pressed a key by accident while moving the laptop it would attempt to wake up and then shut off since it wasn't getting any juice from the shot battery. Yesterday I was noticing that the battery light on the side of the laptop had started flashing no clue why. And then when I'd put the laptop to sleep as soon as I unplugged it from the power source it would attempt to wake up and then shut off . This was annoying having to endure the long boot up process every time I changed rooms but it was manageable. Also the battery icon on my laptop now had an 'X' over it and hovering over it would tell me it was 255% charged . I tried fiddling around with Battery drivers reinstalling or enabling/disabling them but this didn't change anything. Then one of the times I was moving the laptop it was taking abnormally long to boot up stuck on the ASUS screen and then eventually started performing a Startup Repair... This completed and then I was able to log-in like normal. Then it did that again the next time I booted it up but failed and now I'm getting a blue screen with CRITICAL PROCESS DIED no way to access my desktop through safe mode or otherwise unable to do a system restore I've tried three times and all of them have failed and I'm at a loss. Any help at all would be appreciated. It's an ASUS X556U running Windows 10. I have access to the troubleshoot menu which allows me to get into command prompt but there's an error every time I try safe mode. Thank you in advance.,0.126,0.796,0.078,-0.9647,-1,0

I have nothing downloaded on it except for Bitdefender and your basics like Firefox and Microsoft programs. My laptop has never been dropped and no one uses it but myself. x200B I have noticed over the course of the last 2 - 3 weeks my laptop - Has a small group of black pixels at the top left of my screen that lag. I'll open a program and they'll remain black for a half a minute before changing to whatever colouimage should be there like a thumbnail picture . - My browser has been freezing and becoming unresponsive despite only having 2 - 5 tabs open? Ie. 5 tabs of Reddit lol - My laptop seems to have moments where after it turns on it cannot find any WiFi connection despite me having two different internet providers set up. - It blue screened a couple of times saying that there was an an error and it needed to restart. Stop code WHEA UNCONTROLLABLE ERROR. x200B I always update my system and make sure that my drivers are up to date. I recently used Geek Squad support who said that he found a couple of updates that needed to be done ? and that everything should work fine now - obviously it is not. Does anyone have any idea as to what may be causing these issues? Is the pixel situation something that they're able to repair? x200B Thank you for your time I appreciate it.,0.083,0.821,0.096,0.544,1,1

A couple weeks ago my VG278Q went all white and i opened a case with asus. pretty straight forward stuff they created an RMA case for me and shipped them the monitor. they are now claiming that there is a scratch on the screen and they are refusing to repair the unit. I have been interacting with customer support people explaining that there was no scratch on the screen and i sent them a picture of my monitor before i shipped it and there is no scratch on the screen. Also the scratch is completely irrelevant to the problem with the monitor. so i don't know why they cant just fix it and send it back to me with the scratch. All i am getting from them are emails saying that they will not fix the monitor. they seem to be completely ignoring me and my concerns. It also doesn't seem to matter to them that i have been a long time customer of theirs and have spend thousands and thousands of dollars on asus product as a consumer and a small business consultant. So I'm pretty disappointed to say the least. i feel betrayed. and now i have to go and replace my 300 monitor and like.... i would have just bought a new asus monitor but i don't want to now. but i dont want to buy a different brand because i really like asus and everything i have is already asus. so yeah... pretty bummed out right now,0.07,0.86,0.069,0.573,1,1

I tried everything and nothing... this software is dificult to unninstall/install. After a while investigating found a solution and decided to make a guide on how to repair a damaged installation and cleanly install the software again. x200B It's a little tricky but lest go! x200B Pre-Requeriments -AI3 Cleaner Source Thanks to Raja ASUS . -Ccleaner Software installed -AI SuiteIII Version 3.00.52 2019/07/09 -AI SuiteIII Version 3.00.51 2019/04/12 x200B 1.- Recollect some info First of all on windows execute the command services.msc press the Windows Key R on your keyboard . You need to know the exactly name of all the asus services for that search them on ther list - Right Click - Properties and in the first tab General can see the Service name. Write down the names of all ASUS services... I recommend use the windows notepad... and save the file on your desktop. I don't have all the services because the last AI Suite 3 Actually Working don't use the same services and only have the asComSvc service and AsusFanControlService but you probably have 1 or 2 more. Look in the service description to found all Asus services they should all be on the list together so close Okey at that point you have your service names saved in your notepad list. x200B x200B 2.- Boot in safe mode make sure you have Ccleaner installed befor that Lets Hold Windows Key R on your keyboard again and Run msconfig command without . In this case you can run it seraching in start menu System Configuration Inside System Configuration go to Boot tab and select Safe boot- Minimal in Boot options. Press apply and restart the computer. x200B x200B 3.- Cleaning ASUS Software Completly You are on windows safe mode. What to do here? Delete all ASUS Files Services and registry keys... -First the ASUS Files inside Program files x86 on C or whatever you have your windows install and delete the folder called ASUS . -Now execute the AI3Cleaner.exe as Administrator and wait a few seconds. -Lest go! now its time to use the names that you colleted in the first step open a command prompt with Administrator rights... if you want to be sure about that create a new shortcut on your desktop Right Click - New - Shortcut and write cmd inside the Type the location of the item box - click next and end . Right click on the shortcut and Run as Administrator. Use the following command inside your command prompt sc delete service name replace service name by the ASUS service names that you colleted do it one time by service and delete all of them. Here a guide/how to delete windows services x200B -Is the moment to run Ccleaner go to Custom Clean tab and click on Run Cleaner after that go to Registry tab and click on Scan for Issues. When the program finish the search click on Fix Selected Issues... the program will ask you if you want to make a Registry backup befor making changes - save your backup and click on Fix All Selected Issues . Done x200B x200B 4.- Install AI Suite 3 Thanks to Riverdog64 from here that give the solution. Well now we have to do something with the downloaded AI Suit 3 zip's You need to repeat the process for both downloaded files Right Click on the zip - Properties and check Unlock on the right bottom and apply. x200B Extract both zip's on diferent folders. I very recommend to creat 1 folder named 51 to put on it the 3.00.51 version and other named 52 to put on it the 3.00.52 version . Well you must need to install the 3.00.51 version first and the 3.00.52 version after. To install it simply execute the AsusSetup.exe . !!!BUT!!! Important if you get the Asio.sys error or some error when try to install the first one 3.00.51 follow the next steps Open the AsusSetup.exe of the 3.00.52 version until the installation window appears and close it by clicking exit. x200B Open and close Finally go back to the Version 3.00.51 installer AsusSetup.exe install it rebot the computer and install the latest version 3.00.52 and reboot again . It's possible that after installing version 3.00.51 some error message appears Asio.sys etc.. that you can ignore. x200B x200B x200B YES! We finished. It worked for me and I hope it can help many others. Good Luck! x200B EDIT IIMPORTANT Valorant ANTI CHEAT Vanguard kill old AI Suite software CPU-Z and other overcloking software Ryzen Master .

Hi all A little while back as I was using my Zephyrus laptop I heard a very quiet popping/static sound and my laptop screen went black. I've tried draining the battery cannot remove on this model and booting in 30 second increments but I've had no luck. I'm fearing that the laptop screen burnt out but I'm wondering if this might be a pinched display cable instead? If I connect to an external monitor it's working just fine so I'm not worried it's the graphics card. I had updated drivers and factory reset it with no luck. I'm very apprehensive about attempting an RMA given COVID19 and the recent stories posted from users.. I'm wondering if it's worthwhile to dissemble and check the cable to the screen. Just curious if anyone has had a similar experience and if this is most likely a cable failure a screen burnout or something else. This is a new purchase from January so I'm really hoping something hasn't completely given out already.,0.078,0.79,0.132,0.8617,1,1

For a few weeks now I encounter the problem that if turned off for a while sometimes the first boot makes the keyboard on the laptop and USB devices connected light up but there is no ASUS logo and it stays semi-black as blacklight is on. Sometimes force shutdown and starting it again fixes the issue. Sometimes it needs multiple up to 5 restarts. And some days it boots like a charm. The laptop works great otherwise if booting correctly there are no issues with working/gaming with it. The issue came up for the first time after I took it off the power and used it for a presentation. One day I hooked it up with an external screen when it had its hiccups. I dove into display settings and it could not find the built- in screen. But after a restart everything was fine again. If I try to force the issue by shutting on and off multiple times I doesn’t occur. I updated the graphic drivers both intel and nvidia. I checked via MyAsus too. I am now restoring the laptop as the issue came up ca. half a year after purchase bought in August 2019 in hope it’s something of a driveprogramme messing it up. Due to the current world situation I would prefer not to send it to ASUS but I strongly think it’s a software issue. Any advice? Thanks in advance stay healthy guys.,0.027,0.857,0.115,0.9774,1,1

UX562FD x200B I recently started going to Uni again to do my Masters and needed a new Notebook. The last notebook i owned was a Dell that i bought in 2011 ! that came with both HDMI and miniDP ports only used a desktop for the last 5 years. x200B I guess I fucked up by assuming that a modern laptop that came out that much later would have the ability to hook up to an external monitor and transmit 4k images let alone QHD in 60Hz and didn't do enough research. I was just really convinced by the rest of the specs compared to other 2in1 notebooks. x200B So the somewhat premium notebook that i bough in 2020 for more than 1000 € can only power 1080p through the HDMI 1.4 port what the ASUS support told me which is the only way to connect to an external monitor. x200B No HDMI 2.0 released in 2013 ! No Video capabilities on either USB 3.1 ports. I guess that's to easy or modern DP alt mode over USB 3.1 gen2 released in 2014! So far I was unable to convince the Intel Graphics control panel to allow me to set a custom resolution of QHD at 60hz both the internal Intel HD 620 and the Nvidia GTX 1050 maxQ should have enough power to run 4k. there's even a version of the same model with a 4k screen x200B Direct quote from the ASUS product page for the UX562FD Convenient connectivity A comprehensive set of high-performance I/O ports gives ZenBook Flip 15 the ultimate hassle-free connectivity for versatile flexibility whether you’re in the office or on the road. And the integrated gigabit-class Wi-Fi gives you wired-equivalent network speeds — without the wires! x200B x200B Unfortunately the return period ended before I noticed the problem and now i'm stuck with it. So if anyone managed to get the notebook working with an external monitor and a higher resolution please let me know.,0.056,0.882,0.062,0.3315,1,1

Also while this was happening i noticed that the GPU would clock down to 300MHZ and then go back to 1100 then back down again.

At first I thought it was a no-brainer that the G15 is better in everyway with a cheaper price of 1500 CAD and the latest AMD with far better performance and power consumption. But after doing some research watching online review on the G15 I realize that the G15 actually has a much worse built quality and also some thermal issue.

For some reason the touchpad does not work unless I uninstall Smart Gestures . However this means that I don't get any gestures which have become mandatory for me at this point. I was wondering if anyone else has ever had this issue? I've overriding with the Synaptics driver. The touchpad ends up working but I still get no gestures. I've tried uninstalling all touchpad/keyboard drivers and rebooting. This didn't help either. I've also tried updating to the latest version of Smart Gestures which doesn't help. One thing I noticed is that even when the touchpad is functioning albeit without the gestures if I try to press Fn F9 to enable the touchpad all I get is a message that the Touchpad is disabled. The settings for the touchpad in Windows 10 Settings app don't seem to have any affect either. But when I change mouse settings through control panel it does. I'm at my wit's end here. I tried everything I can think of so any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm running the latest version of Windows 10 on the Asus N550JK-DS71T.,0.056,0.888,0.056,-0.0056,0,0

I have 3 floors and multiple devices. While this is certainly overkill for the size of my house and I could have been fine with just a single AX3000 this system will carry me into a new home next year which will likely be a lot larger. With that said I understand all 3 feature 1GB Wan and 4 GB LAN ports. My question is why on the router interface it is showing 100MBPS for all 4 LAN ports? I should probably just go test to see what speeds I should be getting connected directly to this laptop which should have 1GB Lan port but I'm running CAT7 cables directly into a FireTV RJ45 adapter a Panasonic Tough-book in my office for work and a DECA adapter that wires the other 2 routers through COAX. I know the DECA cap at 100mbps I know the tough-book is likely throttled and I don't have admin access to change it if it even features the 1GB Lan but are the Fire TV adapters really only 10/100? Ultimately could it be the router needs the ports reconfigured? Why have the capability if they are capped with no way to change it? I can not find a setting on the router interface to adjust this. Not sure if anyone has had similar experience. Any help appreciate. I may just be misunderstanding something here.,0.054,0.904,0.042,-0.5863,-1,0

I was hoping to get it at Best Buy for to the accidental damage coverage but it is sold out and/or it just says coming soon.

A couple weeks ago some coca cola spilled over my laptop ASUS Vivobook pro . No major damage except for the audio and the Nvidia graphic card Geforce 1050 gtx .

I opened the laptop and cleaned some things but the nvidia card was still undetected. Any help/tips would be greatly appreciated!,0.052,0.884,0.064,0.5053,1,1

I have one Asus RT-AX88U as my primary router and two RT-AX92U as AiMesh nodes connected via WiFi. The AX88U is basically dead center in the house on the main floor. In the living room feeding all the TV devices and one PC via Ethernet all its Ethernet ports full. One AX92U is at one end of the house on the main floor Dining room in the very front corner of the house mostly acting as a WiFi-to-Ethernet bridge for an Ethernet-connected speakestereo more than anything but it gives WiFi coverage to that side of the house better. The other AX92U is literally as far away as you can get from the other AX92U - in the very opposite corner of the house in the basement home office. The annoying thing is that this node prefer to connect to the other AX92U rather than the AX88U that is much closer! I was trying to use it to bring more stable connection to the multiple computers in the home office - connecting via Ethernet to this node. But with this node off I get WiFi speeds sufficient to saturate my internet connection 100 Mbps but if I turn on the node my speeds drop to 5 Mpbs! Because it's connecting - badly - to the other AX92U at the far end of the house. Anyone know of a way to force the AiMesh nodes to both connect to the main router rather than one attempting to piggyback off the other when it's a far worse signal? If I turn the dining room AX92U off then turn on the office one it of course connects to the main router. But if I turn the dining room one back on the office node switches to connecting to it instead.,0.062,0.911,0.027,-0.9054,-1,0

But local stores only sell the 48WHr battery version. I'm not sure why - they just told me that the 90WHr battery isn't meant for the European market which isn't it just that 90WHr makes it last longer? Why wouldn't it be for the European market do we not use laptops as much? Confusing... Anyways. I'll be using my laptop on the go a lot so I really could use the bigger battery. Is it possible to get a laptop that ships with the 48WHr battery and later replace the battery with the 90Whr version? I'm a bit of a tech noob so sorry if it's a ridiculous question...

However I noticed there were only three options when it came to sticks with a voltage score below 1.35 the list is dominated by 1.35V sticks and the three that were lower aren't available for sale at 3200MHz.

It’s not really super powerful or anything but I used it for my classes and made it work fine. Thing is it suddenly died 9 months ago wouldn’t turn on no matter what. Today I tried to turn it on for the millionth time and when plugged in it miraculously works! Thing is I don’t know absolutely anything about computers and I don’t know if there’s something I can do to know what was or is wrong if it will happen again or what may have caused it to fail in the first place. I really can’t take it to tech support because of the lockdown and this brand isn’t available in my country. So if anyone has gone through something like this I’d appreciate any advice!,0.132,0.783,0.085,-0.8666,-1,0
2,gcw6vq,ASUS,0,2020/05/04 11:06:14,Morning,Owners of ROG Strix G531GU does your laptop also perform like this out of the box? Is this normal? Hi! Last month I bought the G531GU-AL012 i7 9750H 1660 ti 16GB single channel RAM for both gaming and being able to have good performance in general for various university tasks 3D digital art etc. but I was rather surprised at how underwhelming the laptop performed at first.. The CPU was only going at 3GHz instead of 4GHz as I had previously seen in reviews and such and I thought I was losing on performance. Did your laptop also perform this way? I used Throttlestop to Speed Shift the CPU to higher clock but that meant it would overheat to 95C and sometimes to 97C at full fan speed. I could only undervolt it down to -65mV although the difference in temperature was barely 4C after that the Throttlestop bench would give me errors and games like BDO would crash after a minute while many posts reported their G531GU could go down to -125mV with great temps and performance. Also tried playing around with the Turbo power limits but I found nothing that could help me so I reverted it back to normal. Is something wrong with my device? Will dual channel RAM help it perform better at the stock 3GHz that it runs at? Any way I can still get good performance at 3.5-4GHz without melting my system? I'm very unconfident in repasting any sort of chip ,0.074,0.818,0.108,0.8433,1,1

1,gcvqhn,ASUS,1,2020/05/04 10:40:21,Morning,Audio amplification and source-switching issues in ROG Strix AMD motherboards I've reached out on the Asus forums without success and have attempted some diagnostic and troubleshooting work myself with minimal success so I thought I'd reach out here. I have a ROG Strix x570-e motherboard with fully-updated Realtek audio drivers via Armoury crate no comment on that piece of frightening software . The difficulty I've had is in getting amplification settings to stick for the audio out sources I have on my computer - a set of headphones from the front audio jack and a set of powered speakers from the back stereo line out. Specifically I've had to toggle off the 'detect audio jack' and 'disable front panel popup dialog' advanced settings in the included ROG-themed Realtek audio console to have the computer switch automatically between headphones when they're plugged in and the speakers when the headphones are no longer plugged in . Weird given the settings I toggled off would suggest the opposite would happen now but it works. The only persistent trouble I'm having now is that the sound via my headphones is too low. The detected resistance through the headphones is putting it at a level that is low enough that the audio console automatically switches to 'performance' AKA low audio amplification level when I plug in my front panel headphones but it's too quiet for my tastes. Even when I manually switch to 'powerful' or 'extreme' amplification after plugging in the headphones the settings don't stick - they reset after I unplug the headphones and plug them back in. Meanwhile the external speakers plugged into the back panel default to 'extreme' amplification which is utterly insane given they're powered speakers and are plenty loud - at too high an amplification level they're on the verge of distortion even on the lowest PC volume setting. Changing this setting to 'performance' in the audio console amplification settings low level doesn't stick either. Anyone have a solution to this issue? Realtek drivers are nary impossible to find and correctly install these days it seems. Additionally the Microsoft Store refuses to install Realtek Audio Console separately from my Armoury crate whose tentacles have worked their way into my machine so much that removing them has broken some functionality in the past I've had to reformat my boot drive to get Aura sync to work properly so I'm wary of following random people's advice on registry cleaning or uninstallers for drivers.,0.088,0.892,0.02,-0.9793,-1,0

The touchpad on my asus A555L laptop has popped out on the side when researching the problem i found that it could possibly be a swollen battery. What are the signs for that specifically and what should i do if it really is a swollen battery? This is quite an old laptop around 4 years of use and the problem of the touchpad popping out is not exactly recent. I first noticed it maybe a year ago when it was just one corner coming slightly loose and having a harder time clicking it feels like there is some push back but it has gradually gotten worse see At first i thought it wasn't a big deal but i barely ever use my touchpad and always use a usb connected mouse so it couldn't have been aggresive handling of the touchpad. Reading up online it seems it could possibly be a swollen battery which looks pretty dangerous. I don't really know how long i would lose my pc if i had to send it in for repairs with exams coming up this would pose a mayor problem. What do you guys think?,0.105,0.865,0.03,-0.9336,-1,0

Edit - please if anyone has it give me a brief review how is it? 1. Do we get a stand out of the box or not? As few people complained that no stylus was received but when i researched more i got to know that even stand was not included and only YouTubers received the stand this is what i think and i don't mean to offend anyone 2. Yes i know the keyboard layout is a bit different but there is an ON-Screen Keyboard option on Windows and if the second screen is a touch cant we just drag that keyboard and make it a touch keyboard? no one has talked about it.... 3. How is the build quality? I really consider build quality as I won't be upgrading again for at around 4-5 years? Do you think it will last that long? as Asus didn't mention military durability on this product 4. How are the viewing angle can someone share a picture from a normal position? I know it might sound a bit weird but I can't test the laptop and will need to directly buy due to current conditions so I am really confused. I mostly use my laptop on a bed by placing a hard cushion/blanket under it to make it a little up till me thighs 5. I use Virtual box Linux and can we slide the terminal onto the smaller screen? 6. I am not a hardcore gamer but would like to play games like COD warzone Fortnite or a few simple games. The max I would play is for an hour that too only on weekends. Will this laptop be able to run those? At last Thank you and if you have any recommendations or suggestions I would like to hear them,0.041,0.854,0.105,0.9664,1,1

Installing uninstalling and cleaning up your fucking shitty installers by scourging registry and windows files because your programs can't event uninstall their own shit. x200B I just can't understand how you can't afford decent fucking dev team to write you software? x200B EDIT Decided to install Icue and see if it works. I am now able to control ASUS RGB lights via Icue but NOT via Armour Crate. WTF Asus? x200B x200B EDIT 2 In addition to the above issues Armour Crate prevented the CPU cores from idling. Usually Zen 2 processors or 3900x specifically in my case idle at 0.9-1.1v and ramp up to 1.4v or above when under use. For the past few days I noticed that 2 out of the 12 cores where stuck at 4.1ghz all the time and at idle I would sit at 1.4v. So I decided to do a fresh windows installation and monitor core idle voltage after each software install to see what was keeping the cores active. So upon fresh windows install the cores would idle at 0.9v and after installing majority of software and games I use and run in the background it would idle at 1.1v. I created restore point before installing Armour Crate installed Armour crate which immediately recognized the motherboard and ram...good. Next I check my idle voltage for the CPU and its stuck at 1.4 again....not good x200B I run restore and I am back to 1.1v idle. So I try Aura instead it recognized motherboard and ram immediately. Unlike with Armour Crate Aura did not raise my idle voltages tho. So I am going to set the RGB like of my choice and hopefully never have to open it again. x200B ,0.063,0.847,0.09,0.8407,1,1

Like the Corsair H115i AIO... that simply doesn't work and cannot be recognised. x200B I tried every tip in the book and about 5-6hrs of research and reading.... nothing worked it couldn't be controlled it wouldn't even be recognised. As soon as it was plugged back into the old board... worked flawlessly as before. x200B So a word of warning to people considering buying one of these boards... do your research first and don't touch it if there's even a hint of a compatibility issue. x200B I used ASUS boards almost exclusively from mid 2000's after Abit went under until the end of 2018... and only used their GPU's until I suffered from the terrible issues plaguing the R9 280X. But their products and their quality control has taken a massive tumble... and i thought I'd give them one last chance... it was a mistake. x200B Next board will either be an X570 Gigabyte or MSI...

However there are times when the wifi card is detected but can't connect to any wifi s around. It works but does not detect any wifi s within the range. I have checked the device manager and it shows up in there and says that it is working fine. After the card stopped detecting wifi s i can't seem the open 'Network Internet Settings' when i right-clicked the wifi icon. The window opens but doesn't load. I have tried disabling and enabling the card in the device manager window but got no luck. I have to restart my computer everytime this happens. I have tried unplugging and replugging the card back into the motherboard reinstalled the drivers and updated all drivers of the hardwares that are plugged into the system. There are no problems with my wifi as all my other devices are working fine with it.

I have this problem since I updated my radeon driver for the vega 8 inside and daily crashes ever since. The bsod code is THREAD STUCK IN DEVICE DRIVER which translates to something wrong in the device driver. I once did uninstall with DDU both the gtx 1050 driver and vega 8 driver reinstalled it all but unfortunately the problem still persist. And that's only the bsod problem.. Another one again from the red team every time I update my driver say from version 19 to version 20 the moment my laptop goes to sleep the display would suddenly wake up at full brightness and the driver would got downgraded back to version 19. This blows my mind. Another thing because of this problem my vulkan driver got uninstalled somehow. I know this from launching vulkaninfo command and nothing pops out. Also I can't launch dota 2 with vulkan even though I game on my gtx 1050. This blows my mind. And dang while playing dota I often got this weird stutters where the game stops for 1-2 seconds. I am able to move my cursor during the period of the stutter. I'm not sure if the problem caused by my graphic card or the whole laptop itself at this point.,0.174,0.803,0.023,-0.9863,-1,0

1,gbz2ms,ASUS,2,2020/05/02 18:58:13,Afternoon,GA502DU/GU502DU New BIOS 302 Hello all I'm not asking for tech support. Merely wanting to document my experience with this laptop. Since day one I've been having issues ranging from boot issues to the infamous .39GHz/400MHz CPU clock bug. Been through all the BIOS's from version 203 at launch till version 300 just recently. Nothing has fixed my issues. One thing that I did that fixed my bootup issues ANY OS would infinitely load at the BIOS Windows spinning circle ubuntu static/frozen screen . I installed a secondary NVME drive in the second M.2 port only a 256GB Hynix NVME drive. I wiped the primary drive default Intel 660p 512GB and installed Windows directly onto the Hynix and then deleted the Intel from the boot options in the BIOS. Ever since doing this Windows boots up without issues. So I've been using the Intel as secondary game storage since apparently all 1TB M.2 drives aren't compatible I have a Crucial P1 1TB . A new BIOS version 302 has just been released Right when I finished installing the system restarted and stayed on a permanent black screen. I was forced to hold down the power button until the machine turned off but not long enough to reset CMOS. Upon booting up it seemed to boot fine but since the BIOS update reset my BIOS settings I got the infinite load bug back. Going into BIOS and manually deleting the Intel drive from boot options immediately fixed my infinite load bug and Windows booted up instantly. So far I'm testing the .39GHz/400MHz bug and it's looking okay. I'll need to go a couple of days to see if this will reoccur as the last time I reinstalled Windows for the 300 BIOS version it took about a week before the .39GHz bug came back. Not sure why. I make sure to install everything I can for drivers/chipsets/ASUS services. I can not find anything related to patch/release notes for this new 302 BIOS. So I figured I'd post my experience here and see if anyone else has similar or different experiences. x200B My warranty expires in a couple of weeks so if the .39GHz/400MHz bug comes back I'm just going to go to ASUS support and request an exchange for a different model. This has been a complete nightmare of a laptop to use and honestly wish I never bought it. x200B Edit 1 Wanted to give a quick update. So far I've been playing tons of different games on the laptop primarily Valorant and Guild Wars 2. So far no thermal throttling issues nor stuck clock speed have occurred since the 302 BIOS install. This may be the fix for our issues finally but we won't know for sure until more people try it.,0.038,0.915,0.047,0.5209,1,1

I tabbed out to check the temperatures in Armoury Crate but they were only sitting around 80-85C for the CPU and 65-70C for the GPU. Is this normal for this gaming notebook?

I built a new Ryzen 9 3900X system with the ASUS Pro WS X570-ACE Workstation board and 64GB of G.Skill Ripjaws 32BG DDR40-3600Mhz RAM. When I first got it I could not get it to post at all with the memory above 2666MHz. But using the DRAM Calculator for Ryzen I found a set of timings that it now runs at 3600MHz. However it still does that triple boot sometimes where it resets up to 3 times before actually coming on but this time it has not reset the memory timings and works at the higher speed. I also have 2 NVIDIA cards installed a 770FX 1st slot and a RTX 2060 Super 2nd slot . The system is a Linux KVM server with the RTX as pass-through to VMs. However some reboots don't complete and hang and I can tell this as the fans on the RTX 2060 fire up to full for a couple seconds then will turn down at the end of post if the fans stay on full it never posts. In addition with the cards for some reason it has twice randomly decided to change the iommu groups for the video cards and caused the Fedora linux system to lockup on boot since it is blacklisting the 2nd card by its ID and I have to rescue the system. Mind you I have only had the board a couple weeks. Finally I have tried to get the Realtek Management to work I did get it to be visible via the ASUS Control Center express and got the mouse to control but the screen went blank when that happened. /. I can't figure out how to update the Firmware on it either as the control center software expects an img file and the board provides a .exe and batch to flash remotely on a system loaded with windows and I run linux. Has anyone else had these kinds of issues with this board? I am very close to a return on this board if I can't get it stable. Thanks in advance.,0.016,0.943,0.042,0.8957,1,1

I'm having trouble with my i7-8750H thermals on my Zephyrus GX531GW equipped with a RTX 2070 . While playing some hardcore games like BF5 or Red Dead Redemption 2 my processor goes to 95 usually stays around 90 degrees Celsius and I have some thermal throttling. I already changed the thermal paste Thermal Grizzly properly and cleaned the vents this laptop gets so much dust on the vents . I saw that when I put Armoury Crate on ''Performance'' profile I get way better temps around 5 or more degrees difference on CPU compared to ''Turbo'' profile. Also when I change between this 2 profiles I can see on the image/graphic that GPU performance stays the same but there is a boost on CPU Performance what is probably making my thermals go higher . Question 1 Turbo mode on Armoury Crate is an overclock on my CPU? How can I see the values from Performance and Turbo profiles. I can't find them anywhere. Question 2 Manual Mode has by default GPU Base clock offset 100/120Mhz and Memory clock offset 150/200mhz. This 100 and 150 values are overclocked or are normal? I dont get this numbers... And what manual mode does to my CPU performance since I can only control the fan speed? Question 3 The manual profile let me put the fans up to 110%. Is that safe this extra 10% ? Thanks!

6,gavtqc,ASUS,6,2020/05/01 05:38:23,Night,ROG GA502du Review One of the best laptop deals with a little tweaking Last week I bought a 2019 13 MacBook Pro and it was a great fluid machine. But it was 1400 had only two ports one needed to charge the thing! and no discrete graphics. Not to mention that butterfly keyboard. I took it back looking for something with a bit more utility and with almost nonexistent stock at the store grabbed an ROG GA502du with the Ryzen 7 16gb RAM 512gb SSD and a 120hz screen for 950. While out of the box the laptop left a bit to be desired with some tweaking it's a phenomenal deal that shouldn't be overlooked. Keyboard and Touchpad The keyboard has been reviewed as being a bit 'soft' and low-travel. Between this the butterfly MacBook keyboard and my Dell XPS 7590 among others this keyboard is nothing short of excellent on my machine. Travel is smooth and consistent and accuracy is great. A strange occurrence I've found is that there is some coil whine on the ROG when the keyboard backlight is off and gets quieter as it gets brighter to basically silent on full keyboard brightness. The touchpad is nice and accurate but it is plastic so while it's very comparable and even more responsive than the XPS. Clicking is uniform I just wish that there was a bit less drag on it but as others have noted finger oils do make it smoother and grossly more pleasant after a day or two of use. I/O Definitely a nice departure from the Mac. HDMI 2.0 lets my finally be able to easily hook up to a 4k60 monitor and Freesync even seems to work! I was very surprised to find that the onboard DAC/AMP is a lot better than expected for the price. For almost half the price of the XPS this laptop has an honest headphone amp which the Dell does not and drives my Audeze LCD-2 headphones easily and cleanly - something I only expected to get from a Mac and I'm glad to not need an external amp. USB-C and A are nice to have but as this is an AMD laptop there is no Thunderbolt 3 which would have been nice. The barrel jack is a bit old-school high-watt USB-C charging would be an upgrade but hey 950. Performance and Heat Here I made some changes. I upgraded the RAM to 24gb by replacing the 8gb single stick to 16 with 8 soldered onboard. I also added a 256gb SSD I had laying around. The cooling solution on this computer is really great I was impressed by how many heat pipes there were which even were connected to the MOSFETs with thermal paste. Looking at you Dell! The Dell though it had a faster i7 actually performed worse as the MOSFETS heat soaked the laptop and it thermal throttled significantly. On the ASUS I replaced the thermal paste on the CPU and GPU with Kryonaut and took off those ridiculous vent blockers on the bottom of the case and am hovering at 35-40C all day streaming 4k video. Gaming hasn't been tried yet. The Nvidia driver that comes with the computer is very problematic I fixed this by switching to the studio driver in Geforce and did a clean install and no more BSODs so far. It runs cool quiet and has great battery life now that the fans aren't strangled. Display and Audio The display is fine. The 120hz refresh rate and low response time are very nice and animations are buttery smooth - it feels even smoother than the MacBook when just scrolling around in Edge which I thought I'd never see. Brightness is lackluster and colors are muted but it's reasonably sharp and viewing angles are very good. Somehow it looks much nicer and more vibrant when watching Netflix so while I'll probably upgrade the screen it's good for now. Audio is very good as well. The down-firing speakers are better than the XPS and the Mac although with the angle of the drivers mutes the treble a bit. A common theme for this laptop the audio is a lot better than the price would suggest. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions on it! I'm very pleasantly surprised by the ASUS and am using it for my home desktop. x200B EDIT I've also noticed that the panel isn't necessarily as bad as it looks out of the box. Some calibration in Windows and the Radeon driver do a lot to bring up the brightness contrast and saturation. For mine -5 brightness 112 contrast and 120 saturation looks good to my eyes.

1,gb6762,ASUS,2,2020/05/01 14:48:52,Afternoon,Asus TUF x570 Wifi - Wifi issue I'm getting abysmal rates from my onboard wifi card. Unfortunately because of the setup I have to use wifi instead of a preferred LAN cable. I have a commercial grade Ubiquiti Wifi dish sitting about a foot above my wooden desk on a wall paired to a commercial grade switch and router and all connected with shielded cable - and I get great speeds on other devices so I know the network is not the issue. . Underneath the desk is the computer - the antennae cable that comes with the board isn't long enough to reach above the desk so it's mounted on the wall behind the desk about half a foot under the top of the desk. . If I pull the desk away from the wall the signal is slightly better. I'm getting around 16ms ping with around 30mbps down while my phone wandering around the house several meters away from the dish and through several walls is able to achieve 7ms ping and over 120Mbps down. I've updated the drivers and tried to play with the settings - not sure what I'm doing though. Is it possible it's too close? Do I need to replace the Antennae? Theoretically the onboard wifi should give me baseline AC speeds correct? Any help welcome.,0.02,0.896,0.084,0.9167,1,1

I Ordered from a retailer from Sweden. I been reading about issues with these cards. So I wrote to ASUS support and got this mail Unfortunately then we do not have service directly through us. Please check that your graphic card is one of the affected cards here If it is then please contact the store where the card was purchased from for warranty processing so that the screws can get changed. So then I wrote to the retailer in Sweden and got this mail Asus offers a free upgrade of the mounting screws. You can get these by contacting an ASUS service center. In Europe and the Nordic countries Asus defers to the retailer as they have no service centers. We have not received any screws for upgrade from Asus. It is therefore impossible for us to offer this service. We can of course offer standard warranty service. I would like to point out that the current issue regarding the mounting pressure of the screws is not a warranty issue. It is simply a fix to improve the cooling capablities of the card. If you have any other issues covered by warranty performance issues actual and measurable overheating crashing etc we will be more than happy to replace the card for you. Then I wrote to ASUS support again and showed them what the retailer replied with and got this mail from ASUS support Your Retailer will have to send the card in for service where the screw is then replaced. unfortunately the screws will not be sent out to retailer or end-users. So this means im stuck. Retailer don't consider this as a warranty issue and ASUS support won't let end users send the card in it has to be the retailer store that sends it in. So end users have no offer from ASUS after all since we can't send the card in our self. what do you guys think? what can a end user do now?,0.073,0.841,0.086,0.8675,1,1

Apparently it's on all the time otherwise? Seems kinda nuts. 2. Can you disable the RGB for the mobo and any other individual compent I guess with Aura Sync? 3. If you disabled the RGB for the mobo in Aura Sync then uninstalled that software would the mobo's firmware remember that setting? i.e. have effectively disabled RGB without even having Aura Sync installed. ,0.066,0.891,0.043,0.2524,1,1

Doing some digging while chatting with Best Buy support I noticed that the model number listed on the site is X712DA but the model number on the laptop says M712D. The Asus box that the laptop comes in has both numbers listed. So did something get crossed in the inventory or labeling of the boxes?

I have recently bought a new motherboard to change my Gigabyte and I choose the Asus in the title as soon as it arrived I mounted it and installed windows 10 and it works really well the problem started the I tried to first boot an working ssd with macOS Catalina with clover and following various guides that use the same motherboard and that work it didn't boot obviously. Then I made a new usb installer first with clover and it didn't complete the install in the final reboot it boots to the pole logo and an empty loading bar and stays there until I shut ir down. After that I successfully made an usb installer with OpenCore 0.5.7 and tried to install macOS Catalina again and nothing it boots and in the first reboot boots to an black screen and stays there until I shut it down. After that I initiate contact with the support service from ASUS it take 2 days until they contacted me saying that this particular motherboard only works with windows. That answer didn't please me and I contacted them again telling the true that I had made my research before buying this motherboard and sending them pictures of the settings needed for it working successfully. Today I received another answer from ASUS telling me that they didn't support other OS in that motherboard and lamenting that fact. I beg forgiveness for the long post and for the rant but I need your help to make it work or I have to sell the motherboard but it didn't please me because so many have succeeded why not me?

Recently I started editing some basic videos for work and even free software like Shotcut perform badly so I started looking into upgrading my hardware.

As I don't game that heavily anymore. I'm leaning on buying a E495 because of the price and AMD Ryzen processor with integrated graphics.. But I have understood that the E series don't have the same build quality as T and X series. I have a X240 atm and love it. I think the build quality is really nice and like the portability. Even with an extended 48Wh battery. And I love the keyboard. It's awesome. So... How would the build quality be compared to a X240? And especially the keyboard? And can you swap it out between ANSI and ISO layouts based in sweden ? And to the performance I think 16GB memory would be enough for me. Processor also would be sufficent I think. I'm not really certain about the VEGA 10 graphics do all ryzen 7 have it? . I have one game that I regularly play. Company of heroes 2 . And would like to play it in 1080p. I would love to be able to play other games but because of time and other interest atm I don't really care that much about it. And for desktop use I would like to be able to drive a 4K external screen. Just to be able to use it as a desktop aswell. Also any good recommendation on a docking station for desktop use? I have almost entirely moved over to Linux as main OS. Only windows for the gaming atm will probably switch that aswell along the road. And if you have any other recommendation for a price worthy thinkpad for my use case I would gladly hear about them! Thanks ahead of you input! Extra info about my desktop for comparison Intel i7-6700K Non overclocked 16GB 3200MHz Ram RX 570 graphics Intel Z170 ITX motherboard TLDR How is the build quality of E495 especially keyboard? Can you change between ANSI/ISO layout? Gaming performance of Ryzen 7 3700U with graphics. 1080p Windows and Linux? Desktop performance of Ryzen 7 3700U 4K Linux? Docking station?

I prefer Linux but I am fine with using Windows as well. Anyway I would love to install Linux probably Fedora Workstation on it but I have read online that some people bricked this specific model when trying to. The others seem to succeed. What is your experience with it? Does it work properly with Linux? Is there a risk of getting it bricked?

But a couple of weeks ago I bought an external monitor to go with it so that I could start coding but I have noticed that there is a subtle but very noticeable input delay in the monitor when I attach it. This is very noticeable when I watching something on Netflix or HBO Now. And I have tried everything to fix it. From turning the monitor to game mode to turning off overdrive. Nothing works. I know it’s certainly a new issue since I had been using an external monitor in my grad office and it worked perfectly on there. And still does. But that’s a FHD monitor and this is a QHD. I was also on call with Lenovo today for an hour today and they determined that it’s not an issue with the monitor but with the laptop software and asked me for 70 to get help on that. And I cannot afford that. I am a student and spent all I had on this monitor. Any help that you can provide would be very very appreciated!,0.024,0.847,0.13,0.9764,1,1

I plan to upgrade the RAM eventually. Do I need to add 8gig to pair with the 8 soldered or can I add 16? can I add an internal HDD or should i just plan to use an external HDD/SDD to back up all of my files and handle photos/overflow from the 256G? Is the wifi chip soldered in the T495? I don't think I need bluetooth but curious if it was an option down the road should I buy an extended warranty? I have an older ideapad and never had any issues and hoping to get 5-10 years out of this which would outlast the warranty. thoughts? Thanks in advance!,0.011,0.876,0.113,0.9401,1,1

1,gqrh7c,thinkpad,10,2020/05/26 22:06:33,Evening,Help me make my mind up Hi all me again. I can’t decide between a Thinkpad T480 L490 or E490. Or a Dell Latitude 7490. As before I’m looking for a laptop that doesn’t need to be the absolute best but it would be nice to get the fastest for my limited budget. And similarly while it would be nice to have one built like a tank I think I’m going to be happy with anything better than my currently crumbling G50-70. It would be marvellous to get a truly great keyboard but as I’m starting out from such a terrible one I think any of these options will please me. The T480 would be great but it’s over two years old now. Is that too old for a laptop? Will it be sluggish now? The L490 would be good but according to notebookcheck.com it underperforms compared to the E490. But it might be down to sub-par drivers - has that been resolved? The E490 would be good as it apparently is plenty fast but I can’t get a clear indication of the difference in build quality between the L and the E. that and I wonder about the wisdom of the manufacturers extended warranties the L and T models get compared to the E. Finally the Latitude 7490. It’s apparently Thinkpad T480 level built with an excellent keyboard and a bit cheaper. While it apparently outperforms the T480 a fair bit and competes with the L/E490 it’s not a Thinkpad. And apparently runs hot. It doesn’t help that benchmarking seems to make no sense between them all. Even if all the machines benchmarked are i5s with 8GB RAM the numbers seem all over the place. And I can’t tell if one being 200 points higher than another is that much of a difference.,0.038,0.757,0.206,0.9959,1,1

I bought a Thinkpad X1 Yoga 3rd gen a couple summers back and I have had more problems with this device than an old cheap ASUS laptop that I used daily for years. I first ran into some hardware problems where the M2 drive wasn't screwed in all the way where I had to send it back for them to repair the device as it was still under warranty received this error only a few weeks after the purchase . Now I am facing a software issue. Whenever I charge my laptop when the device is powered off the battery seems to get no charge. I am assuming this is due to software specifically Thunderbolt as I found a critical update for Thunderbolt on Lenovo's forums. However no matter how I try to install these updates I run into fatal errors. I created a thread on Lenovo's forums but I have not heard anything after about 3 weeks. My device isn't under warranty so I don't see any other way to get the support you think you would deserve after spending so much on a device.

Lenovo Vantage ver 4.12. 60% and start charging at 40% has been what I have maintained for about the last three years now. Laptop is plugged in 95% of the time. I noticed the last few weeks I was down to about 42% plugged in not charging and about every 6 months or so I drop below the 40% range and the notebook threshold kicks in and charges back up to 60%. Machine is powered down and unplugged every night. This morning probably a couple of hours after booting up I noticed that the battery icon showed fully charged 100%. I did notice some excess heat coming from the right front where my palm rests this morning but task manager did not show anything unusual so I did not think too much about it. I now realize it was the battery charging. When I went to look at Lenovo Vantage I could not find the battery threshold settings anymore. The machine is woefully out of date regarding updates etc. but that is another story. All browsers and Bitdefender are up to date. So is the version of LV 4.12 the problem or was I just not able to find the threshold setting? TIA.,0.056,0.918,0.026,-0.545,-1,0

I have however noticed a potential problem - when under normal use the temperature is doing well under 50 and the fans are not on but when I plug in the charger the temps jump up to 70 degrees without any change in productivity it even stays there if I close down everything! The keyboard doesn't get that warm but the fan kicks in which is a bit annoying and it doesn't seem sustainable in the long run to push 70 everytime I am charging. Does anyone else have this issue or have any tips on how to fix it? EDIT When the charger is plugged in the CPU goes from 1700MHZ to about 3200MHZ instantly but there is nothing in the task manager to account for this in fact in task manager the load stays below 50% for the CPU Thank you!,0.043,0.89,0.067,0.625,1,1

It has the 1600x900 display which going by the posts on here isn’t great and is a TN panel. I have used a T460 for work and it had the 1920 x 1080 IPS panel and it looked great. Reading up on the screen swap it looks an easy enough swap however seems to be an issue with the display whitelist I have found this one on eBay and they state in the listing that it’s OEM and brightness should work Is there anything to look out for when changing this? Can the sticker be reused or does it require a new one and is there part numbers for both the sticker and the plastic bezel in case I need to replace either? I see another option is to flash the BIOS which I wouldn’t mind doing as I’m not bad with technical things but ideally if I can avoid it then that would be preferred. Lastly is there a whitelist on WiFi cards? I’d be looking to upgrade this too if you have any suggestions. Thanks in advance!,0.014,0.891,0.095,0.9367,1,1

So now I'm looking at alternatives and the x250 seems like a better deal except for the keyboard and I've heard that the X1 carbon KB is different again. So my questions are these 1. Is the x250 a quality machine compared to the x220? Any handicaps that should be noted? 2. Is the KB horrendous or meh or good for a modern KB? As I'm going to be a student soon it's fairly important. 3. For the price should I just buy an older X1 carbon and call it a day? Is the keyboard worse? The battery life would be much less than the x250 I would think. As an extreme alternative I could just try to find a lithium battery for my 1161 and use some kind of micro Linux distro......

I've been looking for a low-profile laptop style keyboard for quite a while and it seems that SK-8845/8855 fit the bill exactly with an added bonus of a Trackpoint. These seem to be available for sale on ebay and aliexpress however for what I'd consider a very steep price 70-90 usd for what is essentially a rubber dome keyboard. I have also considered the newer Lenovo Trackpoint keyboard which is just a bit cheaper but it has chiclet keys and doesn't look half as cool imo. Are these worth the price tag or would it be better to wait for a lower price and what is considered a sensible price for these? Which one 8845 or 8855 would be a better choice? edit Also for those who bought these off ebay/ali would you recommend it? What is the build quality?,0.018,0.835,0.147,0.9575,1,1

Is there any change in recommendation for year 2020? I do not have confidence to change screens or reapply thermal paste. I have confidence to replace the memory and the HDD storage. I'm looking for a computer for a 8 year old to help in remote classroom sessions in the current lockdown. Computer must have Bluetooth for audio.

Run Debian GNU/Linux with LXQT or similar lightweight DE. Should be suitable for 4 more years considering web browsers keep wanting more and more resources. Kid does not have any ipad or tablet. We feel a computer may be better suited as it puts the child in discipline in having a dedicated workplace and the computer screen remains at a better distance than a tablet. Kid dislikes using tablet / mobile for classroom meetings because of the small screen size and the videos of participants are very small compared to a regular monitor. 1.

OS Windows 10 Intel XTU 6.5.1.360 CoreTemp 1.15.1 and Cinebench 20 BIOS is up-to-date. I would like to undervolt the part due to battery power and temperature. Of course the device should also retain its performance. It's about Office graphics sometimes games ala Diablo 3 or Stardew Valley. I was able to bring the offset to -0.100V here Cinebench and XTU are running in the first tests. From -0.105V my device freezes. The temperature of almost 100 is quite high but I didn't know before what the temperatures are like with this device. I did not dare to use the internal GPU and TDP. Actually the temperatures of almost 100 should become less load as soon as I bring the offset to -0.100V but the temperatures stay just below 100 . Is this due to Energy/UEFI settings? Actually I wanted to undervolt the MX150 but without CPU it doesn't make much sense. Idle with power supply 50 to 54 I had now once pressed Turbo Boost Short Power Max and Turbo Boost Power Max each to 15W instead of default 44W. Sure CPU is now cooler 77 instead of 97 but of course with a loss of power if I read the tables correctly. Also Core Voltage Offset to -0 100V.

I've been using a Thinkpad P53 for work/travel but I find it a bit heavy for me so I'm looking at trying the Thinkpad X1 Yoga. I considered the regular Yoga series but the specs are a bit below what I'd need for work and I prefer the Thinkpad keyboard and mouse. I've been reading the reviews of the Gen 3 vs the Gen 4 what features have changed and so on and I'm not finding too much different between them that bothers me. However when I look on the Lenovo site they say the Gen 4 has up to 18 hours of battery life whereas the Gen 3 only has up to 15.4 hours of battery life. Yet most of the reviews I've read say that the Gen 4 battery life is a bit lower than the Gen 3 though that may just be a result of different screen choices . Does anyone have any experience using eitheboth who could comment on what the real battery life usage is of this systems? Also if anyone has any experience running Linux on either is one better than the other as I've read some Lenovos have trouble running Linux depending on the model and BIOS.

Or have I got this all wrong and is the Lenovo recovery still supposed to work with non-Windows filesystems? Any expert advice would be much appreciated. I was hoping to gift this laptop to a friend with kids in school.,0.072,0.783,0.145,0.924,1,1

Ive been using it on windows 10 that IS laggy on Merom so i coulndt do anything about it until recently when i decided to try linux. I chose elementary os v5.1 bc i really like its interface. The problem is that sometimes its snappy af can even play 1080p 60fps youtube and sometimes lags so much it absolutely drives me crazy. Already opened and repasted it so its not thermal throttling. The battery is an original ibm with 1% wear and the power supply is a 90w from my x61 . What could it be? Edit when it decides it time to lag it cant play even 240p video scrolling is a no go and sometimes even mp3 playback goes wild,0.131,0.808,0.061,-0.8799,-1,0

The left hinge actually gave out a while ago shortly after a drop and I just went full ghetto-mode removing the bezel and letting the right hinge do the work. That one finally gave out on me tonight while I was watching TV in bed. I found this video on the repair process which recommends buying new hinges and super-gluing them into place. My problems with that are 1. the area connecting the screw to the top cover assembly looks worn/stripped for one of the screws I'm not sure if that would be a problem or not 2. the replacements parts often don't come with new screws and two of mine are wobbly 3. This was like a 100 refurb anyway and I really don't want to put more money into this device than necessary. I don't mind a 25 repair but if it's going to just be a recurring issue maybe I should buy another beater anyway So I'm wondering if this will have a chance of working if I just try super-gluing without getting replacement hinges or if the hinge replacement would be strictly necessary. I'm also curious if anyone has had experience with this issue with this or similar models and has any wisdom to impart.

I used a ThinkPad AC adapter slim tip in my office but am not going to the office now for obvious reasons . All of a sudden it stopped charging yesterday but the USB-C adapter still charges my phone. I switched back to a slim-tip AC adapter and it charges fine. I thought perhaps it was a hardware problem from the stress of inserting and removing the charging cable several times a day over the past few months but I inserted a USB-C flash drive into the USB-C port and Windows 10 makes a sound acknowledging that something was inserted but fails to acknowledge the drive. The same drive works as an OTG device on my phone or as a USB-A device in my ThinkPad. Of course it still could be that one pin is broken on the USB port but I am now wondering if it's a software problem that can be solved by this update? Before I try it I thought I'd ask here and also report it in case anyone else has had the same problem. I also think it's really nice that this machine has two different ways in which it can be charged although I wish they weren't literally next to each other.,0.137,0.812,0.051,-0.9636,-1,0

5,gpx2h2,thinkpad,12,2020/05/25 12:46:02,Morning,My First Thinkpad Impressions Bye Bye Elitebook Recently I have received my Thinkpad! But first one minute of silence for my old HP Elitebook 840 G2. It served me very well! It is still a great laptop everything works fine and it still can grasp most of the tasks in my workflow. However I wanted to upgrade a few components screen Thunderbolt USB-C charging etc I got a relatively good deal and you guys inspired me to go with Thinkpad. Here are the specs of my Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen. x200B As you can see I picked Ubuntu 20.04 and that new GNOME looks gorgeous on the 2K panel! A few impressions on the Thinkpad - I was surprised that the fingerprint works out-of-the-box I think I only needed to update the firmware. - The speakers do not work properly the bass is definitely missing but I saw that the guys from Launchpad are working on the issue. It seems there is a workaround but it is not a big deal for now. - Face unlock doesn't work. I tried to install howdy but it didn't recognize the sensor. With the fingerprint working fine I didn't want to invest more time. - The keyboard is amazing! I hate the position of Ctrl key though hopefully I will get used to it. - The screen is fantastic 2K but I lowered the resolution to 2048x1152. I tried 2K with fractional scaling and 1080p without scaling but I settled with 2048x1152 it doesn't hurt the battery that much and I can still put a lot things on the screen. - It is super light this was one of the main reason I chose to go with X1 Carbon instead of T490. - There are two Thunderbolt ports and both can be used for charging. But Lenovo why not putting one of them on the right side so I don't have to pass the charging cable around? O - I was waiting for 6-core version and got very disappointed with the fact that 6-core version will not be available in Europe. Therefore at the end of February I ordered this one. - That i7 is amazing for quick bursts surfing the web is flawless. However as soon as I start tasks like compilation on all cores it starts to throttle and gets warm. I guess it is normal for laptops especially for ultrabooks it is something I anticipated before I purchase it. After all it is 14nm technology / My goal is to bring the portability and space efficiency to the next level. Here are a few ideas in that regard - I ordered a vertical stand from AliExpress Hopefully with no or minimal modifications it should hold my Thinkpad like this That way I plan to save a lot of space on the table for my electronics. - Depending on my needs in the future I may buy Aorus Gaming Box. It is a small box with integrated power supply but I couldn't find it neither in Switzerland nor in France. - In meantime I ordered a dock so I can use a single cable for charging and the peripherals. - For long trips I plan to order this Xiaomi 45W power bank Depending on usage it should give me up-to 15 extra hours up-to 25h in total for long trips. - One more great thing I found on AliExpress is this tiny 65W charger I can put it in my backpack and forget about it. Let me know if you guys have any tips or quetsions! Any good low profile keyboard without numpad?,0.036,0.829,0.135,0.9958,1,1

Hello I have a brand new T480s Type 20L7 and I need your help. I haven't found any duplicate posts so please share a link if they exist. If there's a better subreddit for these questions please direct me accordingly. I've learned my new laptop has an issue with Thunderbolt / USB-C right out of the gate thanks Lenovo . For reference My laptop has Windows 10 installed however it is my intention to replace the OS with Manjaro KDE Plasma. I am not interested in dual-booting as I have another machine specifically for Windows. I want to do the following 1. Update the device's BIOS/UEFI. 2. Update the Thunderbolt software. 3. Update the Thunderbolt firmware. 4. Replace Windows with Manjaro. I'd like to identify the easiest and safest way to accomplish this. I'm effectively drafting some step-by-step instructions for myself and others . Question 1 Should I do this before or after I replace Windows with Manjaro and why? Question 2 The link above recommends a tool called Lenovo Vantage. Can this tool perform all three steps and safely? Question 3 I understand Lenovo Vantage is Windows-only. What are some good alternatives available for Linux? Question 4 How can I validate that I've made these changes successfully? To be clear I think I can probably figure these things out on my own but I'd greatly appreciate any help from the community. This will be my first ever ThinkPad and my first time using Manjaro I'm graduating from Ubuntu - and I'm very much looking forward to using my new T480s. Thanks!,0.006,0.83,0.164,0.9874,1,1

9,gpn7jk,thinkpad,2,2020/05/25 02:05:51,Night,And now I have TWO X220s. I used to work in the field in pretty harsh environments and never felt comfortable with my work MacBooks. Thus began a succession of cheap subnotebooks none of which lasted very long. In 2015 I decided to try out a ThinkPad. I'd always thought of them as lame office machines but after much research including this sub I decided on the X220. I found a cheap one without the IPS screen but with NMB switches. It felt solid I threw it in my pack with impunity and I could type comfortably in the field. Soon after this my work MacBook died but I declined the 500 repair bill and upgraded my trusty ThinkPad with new memory an mSATA drive and threw in a Majestouch keyboard for good measure blue switches of course. One night last month I was enjoying a glass of wine and watching The Expanse and I grabbed my computer to check up on something in the show. Obviously the laptop and the wineglass were on the same arc and my X220 enjoyed a full glass of Merlot. Not a drop on the table or the carpet. I was fairly composed I immediately held the laptop upside down and jammed the power switch for a hard shutdown. I whipped the battery out grabbed some paper towels and tried to sponge out as much as possible. I left it like this poured myself another glass and continued with the show. The next morning I took the keyboard out and placed the computer in a bag of rice. The keyboard had definitely taken the brunt and the board was stained red. I took all the keys off and cleaned it thoroughly then left the whole lot to dry out for a few days. No good. I plugged in the power cable the charging light flashed then went off. I pressed the power button. Nothing. I was already resigned to this outcome but it still felt like a loss. While the trooper was drying out I had already been on eBay looking for a replacement. I had lucked out pretty quickly and found an X220t in very good shape. It wasn't the cheapest but I had covered the t version for a while and this seemed the perfect excuse. By the time I had finally realized my laptop was truly dead the replacement was bought and on its way. What a lovely machine. The screen is beautiful I now understand the IPS love I can play with Gentoo and a touchscreen and the transition was fairly painless. I just popped all the old hardware in the new machine and away it went. Gentoo worked fine I just needed a few kernel changes and Windows was due a reinstall anyway. I was up and running an hour after it arrived. Now my one bugbear was the keyboard. My old laptop was Japanese and the new one was US. The new one also had Chicony switches and although subtle they did feel a bit more squishy. Despite the burgundy I decided to try the old keyboard on the new laptop. Five minutes later I was ready to press the power switch. The charging light was on which was a good sign but the power switch declined to oblige. Oh well it was worth a try. The X220t has a power switch on the screen for use in tablet mode. I absentmindedly pressed it and my laptop turned on. It booted I chose Windows I changed my keyboard layout and tested the keys. No problem whatsoever. It even turns off with the keyboard power switch it just doesn't turn on again. So of course my next test was the new keyboard with the old laptop. And now I have TWO X220s.,0.045,0.802,0.153,0.9972,1,1

I know the x1c4 does not have a thunderbolt port but I bought a converter to usb thinking this would be fine. I did this to future proof the dock thinking that I’ll have a thunderbolt port laptop in the future and that the conversion to usb would work. I have it plugged in and it does not seem to be working nothing happens monitors stay blank Does anyone know what the issue is? Is it just not possible? Has anyone else tried this? Is there a driver I can download or something? I’m running out of ideas. Thank you!,0.016,0.927,0.058,0.7052,1,1
1,gpxzjf,thinkpad,3,2020/05/25 13:39:18,Afternoon,Where to look for a vintage ThinkPad? Europe  Hey fellow ThinkPad enthousiasts I am the proud owner of both a T420s which I use as a desktop with external monitor aswell as a T470 which is currently my daily driver. I really love both of them and I'm so fond of them that I might want to start a little collection. My father used to work for IBM for 20 years and used a truckload of different laptops but only his last one before he left IBM due to the company scaling back in Belgium 4 years ago was still in his posession he gave it to me . It's a T430 and I'm currently cleaning and fixing it. Planning on putting an SSD in it and maybe even try out the classic keyboard mod. I would like to have an extra ThinkPad project though and I was thinking to buy a more vintage looking ThinkPad for my little collection. I remember him working on actual IBM laptops and I would like one of those or at least from the period that Lenovo's laptops still looked like the old ThinkPads. I would like to get one that is in okayish condition which means fully functional and passable on the cosmetic front. Things that can be replaced easily and are broken aren't a big deal obviously. A second condition would be that it is still serviceable in some way. I don't expect to run W10 but putting linux on it or an older windows operating system should be possible. So my questions are - Where do I find a ThinkPad like this? I have tried eBay but that's just one big mess and seems to be filled with scams... - What's a reasonable price to pay? I was thinking that I should be able to get something for 100 euro or even a bit less. - What models would you guys suggest? I was thinking of one of the latest IBM ThinkPads or one of the early Lenovo ones. If you have any other suggestions or tips please let me know either in a comment or a personal message. I can use any help I can get!,0.025,0.876,0.099,0.9762,1,1

Lenovo Vantage decided to run some updates and now my dock doesn't connect anymore. Whenever I plug it in it's not recognized as TB3. USBs Network and Audio work as I'm assuming it's being used as a regular USB-C dock. No video output at ALL. Thunderbolt 3 software shows nothing is plugged in. I have this dock at my apartment and my office. It does not work at either location. My girlfriend's XPS13 docks just fine and works as it has been so I know it's not the dock itself. There are no missing drivers in device manager and everything shows as working . I can't seem to figure it out. Charging works too. I went ahead and wiped the whole drive and reinstalled windows.

Looking for a recommendation for a new laptop. Currently using a dire Chromebook that I bought simply because it was so cheap but recently started a new job that requires video editing and it cannot even play the HD video content without glitching let alone edit it it was like 150 I bought it in lockdown as I was isolating away from my computer for 2 months . I also spend a lot of time on my laptop browsing and have an awful habit for having like 50 tabs open at a time. My business partner recommended a MacBook but I want a cheaper ThinkPad alternative. Few bullet points of stuff I’m looking for - Durable/futureproof hence why I arrived at a ThinkPad use to have one back in like 2000 that lasted 6/7 years. - HD video editing - can handle multitasking my terrible tabs habit - has a good webcam I do some tutorials with screen and can capture - I’m thinking 512 SSD and 16GB RAM kinda spec - I like that ThinkPads are business laptops as they’re durable and upgradeable but want it to be nice for media and personal use too - decent screen - good warranty so purchase from a good/official vendor - finally I want to buy NEW and have a budget of 1000 Thank you so much for reading and I look forward to any recommendations you guys have! Thanks EDIT gone with the Lenovo ThinkPad E595 with Ryzen 7 16GB RAM 512GB SSD and Vega 10 graphics. Direct from Lenovo with accident damage cover delivered for 800 quid.

Still happens sometimes. So instead of wasting money on a modern day laptop that I will use maybe 5-10 times a year I decided to jazz up my old T400 to make it somewhat capable of running modern day software. I have a spare SSD laying around and I ordered a T9900 CPU so the only thing left is RAM. But I don't know if I should go for a 2x4GB set or 2x8GB set because my T400 may or may not support the latter. I honestly tried googling but to absolutely no avail. The official specification as well as the forum threads I found all suggest that 8GB 2x4GB is the limit. Thing is they are all outdated written back in the days when 8GB DDR3 SODIMM sticks didn't exist yet. So naturally with only 4GB sticks around and just 2 slots 8GB would be a limit back then. But I couldn't google up any info at all as to wether the things have changed with the release of 8GB sticks. Maybe some of y'all have successfully upgraded your T400 to 16GB RAM or maybe tried to do that and failed. In either case please share your knowledge I'd appreciate it a lot.,0.049,0.864,0.086,0.8226,1,1

X1 Yoga 3rd Gen temperatures Hi all I have a ThinkPad X1 Yoga 3rd Gen that heats up when video calling and gaming of course with gaming but I think there's poor cooling . When gaming in GTA 5 my temperatures are slightly below 90 but they're also in the 90s at times I see 99 C at some points . There is some plastic shielding covering the only intake vent the laptop has. I removed it and tried the game again and my temperatures were now on average 6 degrees celsius cooler. You can see the plastic shielding right underneath the intake vent here There is a closer look and removal of the shielding a few seconds later. My reason for posting is that I wanted to ask if it would be of any issue to leave it without the plastic shielding covering 90% of the intake vent. I'm not sure if it would cause any issues with air flow since it was covering the intake vent in the first place. Would there be air flow issues higher risk of short circuits or any issues of any kind? What is the purpose of that specific shielding? Thank you so much,0.054,0.909,0.038,-0.3034,-1,0

I am currently looking at the keyboard choices on Lenovo’s web store and here in the Nordics they are giving me lots of choices black English UK black German black Swedish/Finnish black Nordic black English EU black Danish. As I do not use a keyboard with any language specific adaptations I think my choice would be between the two English variants UK and EU. Does anyone know what those two look like? The Lenovo website has me at a loss. I am looking for an ISO keyboard vertical enter key and smaller left shift key. The key layout I am currently using on both a MacBook Pro and on other devices through a Logitech K380 is what Apple describes as “ABC”. I would describe it as a British UK keyboard with the Britishness removed. Image of what my keys map to. If both UK and EU options follow the ISO physical layout is there a difference in what characters are printed on the keys? If it is just a few characters off from what I am used to I see no problem with that. I expect to be able to remap them on the software side to match muscle memory and on the hardware side there are always sharpies 😉 I’d be thankful for any hints around the UK and EU differences!,0.039,0.909,0.053,0.6544,1,1

My P52 started to randomly shut off a couple days ago unfortunately a week after my one-year warranty expired . There's no warning before a shut down and the only way I can get it to boot up again is to remove and reinsert the battery. I've noticed a bunch of symptoms that may be related. My P52 shuts off 1. A few moments after plugging in the charger even when the battery has 50% charge . 2. When using Lenovo Vantage to run a hardware test sometimes it gets all the way through without finding any issues including for the battery . 3. When using the Lenovo Diagnostics Tool to check the battery. I charged it over night and was able to finally full the full test today which found no issues. 4. Even after removing the battery and only using the charger. This has been one of the more stable ways for me to use my laptop though which lasts more than a couple of hours this way. If this happens I can only reboot the laptop after unplugging and reinserting the adapter. I tried a Battery Gauge Reset in Lenovo Vantage which failed and gave this error message Failed AC power adapter was detached . I wonder if this has something to do with it as well since the power adapter was plugged in. This seems like a hardware issue to me but hopefully I'm wrong. Has anyone experienced something similar?

But somehow some of the keys were kinda weird to press and not working properly so I got a replacement keyboard. So I installed the new keyboard and everything was great - except for the trackpoint which now is not as precise as it used to be. The trackpoint is still working but in a weird jiggly way. When I try to use it for slowly moving the cursor in a curved way it's pretty choppy and it feels like the cursor is only moving in straight lines. If I apply more force / move the cursor more quickly it gets slightly better. But still it's not as precise as it was before. So I checked on the FRUs and the replacement keyboard is not the same FRU as the old one. Could that be my mistake? Or is the hardware just faulty?

I was a bit apprehensive because it came out so long ago but after using it it's definitely a great machine. Better than the relatively newer Zenbook I've been using and I may make it my main workstation for home use. I got it for about 250 USD and it came with 16 GB RAM i7-4700MQ and I'm pretty sure an IPS display I'm not really sure how to tell but the resolution is on par with the Zenbook and is 1920x1080 . Doesn't have an SSD yet so bootup is slower but the laptop itself is super zippy don't have to worry about using too much RAM. Also the keyboard is really nice and tactile. My only complaints would be I don't really like the trackpad compared to my other laptop and the speaker quality also isn't that great. I can use headphones though so this isn't a big deal. Next steps I'm thinking of are to install Linux have never used it before but want to try it and maybe install an SSD later. I may need to install a new WiFi card as I've been having some issues with Internet connection. Are there any other things that would be good to do? Also the person I got it from kept it in really awesome condition and I'd like to keep it this way if possible.

The two options I'm looking at are the 6th Generation X1 Carbon and the current generation T480s open to others as long as they are available on the Canadian Lenovo online store . Both are about 1300 CAD t480s around 40 CAD cheaper. I'm not willing to stretch my budget to any more than 1400 CAD post-tax. Common knowledge from friends and forums lean heavily to the X1C but I'm currently slightly leaning T480s because a empty DIMM slot for RAM upgrades on the T480s b Dedicated Ethernet jack without having to use an adapter or dock on the T480s c Reported low brightness on the FHD version of the X1C b Reported trackpad issues on the X1C For reference raw specs of the models I'm looking at are identical at i5 8250U 14 1080p 8GB RAM 256 GB SSD Is there anything about that specific X1 Carbon that makes it a better proposition?

3,gpg5ad,thinkpad,35,2020/05/24 16:37:50,Afternoon,X1 Extreme Gen 2 very high temps I was using Bandicut to cut a video and although the program is pretty taxing on the CPU i7-9750H and GPU GTX 1650 max-q the CPU temperatures got extremely high. Most concerning was the 102C CPU package and cores temperature shown in the second screenshot is there a reason for the discrepancy of temps between the first and second screenshots? . I posted a few days ago about a sudden decrease in my X1E2's benchmark performance. I'm wondering if that issue and the high temperatures shown below are due to dried thermal paste. Also I've made sure my fan assembly is clean. Something to possibly note is that even before the sudden performance drop I experienced the CPU would get to 98C or maybe even 99C under max load. However I've never seen anything above 100 before. However would this feasibly explain the suddenness of the performance drop? I would expect a drying of paste to have a gradual performance impact. In addition I have only had this laptop for around 6 months is this a reasonable amount of time for the stock paste to run dry though keep in mind I have run a lot of benchmarks etc. ? One last thing even under high load my GPU never gets above 70C and its performance is lower than what would be expected of it. Is it throttling too early and if so are there any solutions? x200B x200B ,0.035,0.91,0.055,0.6868,1,1

It's decently equipped with an i5-5300U 20GB of RAM and a 500GB Samsung 850 EVO. This notebook is my everything machine. I have a dock at the office with 3 28 displays a USB dock at home with a couple 28 displays in conjunction with the built in and another USB dock setup in my portable office trailer and it travels with me 24/7. I use a lot of browser based app's for work so lots of tabs open constantly. I also work with basic 2d CAD drawings PDF editing and some large KMLs in Google Earth. Lately the ol T450s just seems to be slowing down. I notice the CPU up at 100% quite a lot. RAM HDD seem to handle the load just fine though. Is the upgrade to a T490 with an i7 either 8th or 10th gen going to be a noticeable upgrade? I have been looking at them more and more lately. I would likely go with 16GB 8/8 and the 512GB NNMe drive. Just a decent chunk of change to drop as I would for sure need a new dock at the office and a couple extra power adapters for my other work spaces. I would love to stick with the s model but I also need a built in NIC. I'm not sure the dongle will do it for me as I also use it quite a bit out in the field configuring equipment and what not. I assume they still come with Intel NICs? I need something capable of VLAN trunking.

2,gp8kt3,thinkpad,5,2020/05/24 09:13:27,Morning,Anyone who switched from Dell XPS 13 to ThinkPads? Hello I am currently using Dell XPS 13 9350 2015 . I am thinking of renewing my laptop especially because I want to have more battery life. I mostly do programming and a lot of Youtube/Twitch watching. Naturally the first laptop I looked at is the new Dell XPS 13 9300. On paper and from reviews it looks perfect. I love the 16 10 screen ratio new Ice Lake CPUs Thunderbolt 3 on both sides great built quality its dimensions smooth glass touchpad and its SSD is still upgradable... But reviews don't reflect the long term experience and there are quiet a few people on internet who complain about issues they are having with their new XPS 13s. In fact there are so many that I am afraid that I will pay near 2000 and will get a defective device. The closest alternative seems like ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It is not as perfect as XPS 13 on paper but the imperfections are not deal brakers for me. And I don't see as many people complaining about issues they are having with X1 Carbon which leads me to think that the quality control is a bit better compared to Dell. Out of all the imperfections the thing that most bothers me is that there is no Ice Lake or AMD 4000 option. From the reviews so far it looks like Ice Lake provides significant power efficiency compared to 14nm CPUs. Although the advantage of getting 14nm CPU might be that it is pretty stable at this point in case I want to install Linux for example. Are there any people here who switched from Dell XPS 13 to ThinkPads like X1 Carbon or X390/X395 or T490/T495 etc?

I just wanted to make a quick post for those who might be considering a Thinkpad that the usb-c power supply has known issues which require a replacement of the motherboard. The issues seems to happen to a lot of users right after the warranty is up. Lenovo hasn’t been too helpful on the situation other than offering to fix it at my expense. However there is no guarantee that the next one won’t short out in a year again. I am not trying to knock down Lenovo with this post as I was happy with my previous purchases from them. So if this violates any rules please remove mods. I just want to make sure people are aware that these issues are there.,0.047,0.847,0.106,0.718,1,1

7,gp0qmj,thinkpad,3,2020/05/23 23:19:57,Evening,P53 4K LCD upgrade and some other improvements Hello fellow thinkpad users. I bought my P53 with a 1080p 300nits display thinking that I would upgrade the display to 4k much cheaper If I buy it myself. There are a few compatible options for P53 but I went with NE156QUM-N66 just because 4k model comes with this exact model. Unfortunately 1080p and 4k displays don't use same eDP cable as 1080p one uses. So I bought the required cable DC02C00FW10 for the 4k display. FYI this cable does not work with OLED. It requires a different cable. I also bought this adapter for 2.5 HDD. My 9.5mm 2.5 HDD fit snugly in it. It all cost me around 90 including superbuy shipping fees. When I purchased the laptop Lenovo was charging around 200 for the same display. And I keep the original 1080p display. I've been waiting for the new display and it recently arrived. I made the replacement and it all went well. Screen has gorgeous colours and it is very bright. After 300nits 1080p display it made a huge difference. If you want to try another display I would suggest you to watch out for connector pin pitch display outline size and connector location because eDP cable has just enough length for current display. Upon request I made a video explaining how to disassemble the P53. You can watch here. Power Consumption While changing the display I made a power consumption comparison between my old and new setup. My total system power consumption was 2.99W on idle with minimum brightness with no X server running. No you did not read that wrong. You can achieve this using TLP on Linux According to my measurements old display was using 3W for the backlight. New display is consuming 7.14W at full brightness. Keep in mind that new display is 500nits versus 300nits But also 4k display itself consumes an extra 1.3W. 1080p Total System Power Consumption 4k Total System Power Consumption -- -- -- -- -- min brightness 2.99W min brightness 4.31W max brightness 6.06W max brightness 11.45W In conclusion if your workflow benefits from using a 4k display NE156QUM-N66 is definitely a winner. But if you want to conserve your battery you might wanna look for a 1080p display. Thermal Paste I also was having problems with thermals. Whenever I used anything CPU intensive P53 was throttling immediately. CPU temperature were jumping to 97 C in 5-10 seconds. So I bought MasterGel Maker Nano 11W/mK thermal paste. It really doesn't matter which thermal paste you buy as long as it is a decent one. This was on sale so I went with it. After applying the new paste my thermals are now OK. CPU temperatures rise slowly as it should have been. I suspect old thermal paste was not making a good contact. I made a comparison using s-tui a cpu stress test tool for Linux . Here are the results CPU package was throttling down to 38W but now CPU uses full 45W TDP and it stays at 92 C. RAM And lastly I upgraded the memory from 16GB to 32GB dual channel. Also you might want to look out for memory power consumption because each DRAM consumes 0.62W. So a dual channel setup will consume around 1.3Watts and if 4 slots are all populated you will be seeing a 2.6W just for memory power consumption.,0.039,0.842,0.119,0.9933,1,1

The only time it turns on is after its plugged in for a few minutes. This problem also exists if I remove the battery and try turning it on plugged into the charger. The battery seemed to be on its last legs as the laptop turns itself off at around 50% remaining charge. Tried a few things after googling - remove battery and hold power button for 30 secs re-seat the RAM modules etc but no dice. What could be the problem?

I've noticed some anomalies that are a little annoying and I was curious to find out if the issues were common with ThinkPad computers because I've never owned one before. Upon starting up for the first time I immediately noticed the issue of missing keystrokes. Thankfully Lenovo released an upgraded BIOS which completely solved the problem. I have 2 issues pertaining to the TrackPoint. Issue One The TrackPoint seems very inconsistent with regards to the amount of pressure required in order to move the curser. I've attempted to adjust the settings via the Control Panel to no avail. Sometimes the curser will move quickly over to my second monitor with not a lot of pressure other times the curser is stiff and doesn't move easily in order to say scroll down a web page. Issue Two Occasionally after using the TrackPoint to scroll down a program or webpage the curser will continue to move for 1 - 2 seconds on its own. It doesn't move far or quickly and it almost seems like it is recalibrating itself. Are these two issues normal when using ThinkPads? Neither issue bothers me enough to warrant calling the support line I am just interested as to if anybody else experienced this issue when using the TrackPoint.

I've been thinking of getting myself a Thinkpad for some time now and most likely would be getting one in no longer than 5-6 months from now. I had an opportunity to work on a Thinkpad a bit and immediately fell in love with it. I am currently using a Lenovo Legion Y520 laptop as I was much more into gaming when I got it compared to now. While I've really been enjoying my laptop for over two years now the two main complaints I have about it are the weak battery lasting only about 45-60 minutes while doing some light work like writing and looking at reference material and dull display the colors are all faded compared to the screen I plug into it . I'd like a machine that could last at least 4 hours on battery without me looking for an outlet. I do a bit of everything. Right now I mainly want to get a programming job but I also do some writing and occasionally some basic photo audio and video editing using GIMP and Inkscape Cakewalk by BandLab and Da Vinci Resolve respectively .

I currently have a desktop Intel Xeon X5650 6c/12t 16gb DDR3 Ram AMD RX550 GPU and 240gb SSD 2x2tb HDD. I also own a Thinkpad X260 i5 6300u 16gb DDR4 Ram 480gb SSD. Now I do have a fair bit of media currently sitting at 3tb and growing both systems are either getting old or not powerful enough plus I'd also like to run one system in an ideal world. So I'm torn between an ITX or maybe a mATX build or another thinkpad. I do have a desk and a nice monitor so docking would be fine if I go the thinkpad route and I could use external drive for storage like a 6tb. Now I do play games but nothing too demanding so I've looked at doing a cheap Ryzen build something like a 1600 16gb ram etc or a P50/P50s I know these have quadro cards but YT suggests they will play the games I enjoy and do the work I need them to do as well such as 2d game dev and digital media.

I don't care too much about the extra screen size but since I want to upgrade to FHD at some point anyways it makes sense to investigate the possibility. Two birds one stone. Anyways I know the BIOS whitelist will need to be disabled. And of course the bezel and screen mounting will need to be altered. My questions boil down to the following - Is there anything electronic that has to be altered? I'm not new to electronics work but since I don't have any of the parts yet I can't compare side-by-side to see what is necessary. I'd be surprised if this is a plug-in swap. - Is there a recommended screen to go with? I'm looking for wide color gamut and high brightness if possible but one of those new low-power screens would be good since battery life is a concern. - Has anyone done this while retaining the webcam lid sensor and WWAN antennas? I don't really use any of those except the lid sensor but I don't like the idea of de-featuring the laptop if it's avoidable. - Has anyone made the bezel cuts so cleanly they look stock? I have lots of experience with a Dremel but over a long straight cut it never looks perfect in my experience. Sanding it smooth after might not help either since plastic can look funny sometimes when sanded. Thanks ,0.064,0.832,0.104,0.8657,1,1

I wanted to write a post confirming the simplicity of removing the antiglare film of a B140HAN01.3 lcd panel. There have been complaints about the panel having a 'frosted' or 'screen door' appearence. Depending on one's level of OCD this can be annoying enough to make a person want to purchase another panel. Such was my case. I upgraded a T430S with a LCD converter and a panel purchased on Ebay and pulled from a Dell Latitude E7470 or E5470. Although the upgrade was a substantial improvement over the stock panel it had some scratches on the antiglare screen and the frosty effect was distracting. After searching the net I realized the postings regarding removal were confusing. Some posters implied you cannot remove the panel while others described removing it on what appeared in the post to possibly be a touchscreen. Because I only had 35 in the panel I was willing to risk an attempt. So in the interest of clarity for anyone searching for this topic I want to confirm that it is easy to remove the coating and that the improvement is dramatic. The panel is crystal clear although now it naturally reflects glare. I am pleased with the results. Here is how to do it Remove the panel from the computer. Lay wet paper towels over it. I put it on top of a dry cloth to keep water from getting under it. Wait about an hour and a half and keep the paper towels wet. Scrape a corner up with something sharp I used a paring knife . Peel it off. The coating is a plastic sheet and comes right off. It really is a simple as that. A similar improvement in my opinion can be had from peeling off the textured tape on the trackpad. Makes it feel smoother and more Macbookish. Of course as always this is one person's personal experience and YMMV.,0.034,0.87,0.096,0.9575,1,1

1,gota1u,thinkpad,2,2020/05/23 14:28:03,Afternoon,New to me T480 a couple of questions I recently bought a T480 i5-8350u processor 32gb RAM 512GB NVME SSD 18 months still on the warranty for 609 I've been thinking about upgrading from my T530 for a little while and this seemed like a pretty good deal. So far I'm loving the laptop but there are a couple of questions that I have before I really start setting things up the way I wanted. 1 I read about the issues with the Thunderbolt controller. The Thunderbolt driver was 1.41.645.0 which looks like is the version of the driver that solves the problem but the firmware was only... 14 I think. I upgraded it to 20 on the day I received it. Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything I should be looking out for? I don't have any thunderbolt components so I'm not sure there's a way to test for the issue. 2 Are there any other known issues with this laptop that I should be keeping an eye out for? 3 I'm planning on getting an SN520 512gb drive so that I can dual boot Windows and Linux Linux will be my primary OS . It's got a WWAN card already installed but I don't see myself ever using it. Am I right that it's as simple as pulling the WWAN card out and putting the SN520 in? From what I can tell booting off of the SN520 shouldn't be an issue right? 4 The only issues with Linux that I can see are with the fingerprint reader. I'm a bit bummed about that I liked the fingerprint reader on my T530 but I decided before I bought that it wouldn't be a problem. Everything else seemed to work when I booted from a Live USB. Are there any other Linux gotchas that I should know about? 5 Just curious do you think this was a decent deal? Thanks!,0.032,0.887,0.081,0.9185,1,1
1,got7ca,thinkpad,2,2020/05/23 14:23:51,Afternoon,I have no clue anymore... So I bought an X230T a couple years back. It's been an awesome machine tanking all of the abuse it's received and not showing any signs of it. The one issue I did have was the battery stopped charging randomly. I had always got the not genuine Lenovo battery pop-up but it never actually carried weight. The battery always charged fine anyways. However the charging brick got tucked under a blanket one night while I was playing a game and it overheated. Warped the case pretty bad and melted the solder off the 3 pin connection for main power into the brick. I wasn't able to borrow an iron and solder the pins back in place for about a week. But I was able to bend the pins to get connection and it ran the laptop fine. However during that time the battery would NOT charge at all... Now that the brick is all fixed up though it charges just like new. I'm really curious if anyone here knows about the circuitry in these things generally speaking and has an idea about that. Was it maybe to too little voltage or too high amps to charge the battery and it was just barely managing to power the PC alone? Thanks in advance.,0.077,0.82,0.103,0.8014,1,1

2,gonokk,thinkpad,3,2020/05/23 09:28:15,Morning,Question about L series Thinkpad How does the L series Thinkpad compare to the T and the E. My friend has a T430u and is looking to upgrade soon. I have a E570 and while not being as robust as her T430u it is plenty sturdy for me and I like it quite a bit. I've heard the L series is somewhere in between the E and T in terms of build quality and features. Is that true? Looking at the upcoming Ryzen releases I was leaning towards the L14 over the T14 or E14 simply bc of DIMM slots. T14 Intel all soldered is a shame and E14 Intel only has 1 DIMM single channel RAM...RIP . L14 Intel seems to be the only 14 left with 2 DIMM slots. Even among the 15 the L15 is the only one of the three that has 2 DIMM slots the T15 and E15 each only have one . I personally don't like the soldered RAM direction Lenovo is taking but it is what it is. So the only option left is the L series. My question is simply if I recommend the L14 to my friend will she notice the lesser build quality coming from a T430u?,0.018,0.903,0.079,0.8966,1,1

I've had probably 4-5 Thinkpads IBM and Lenovo but have been out of the loop for a while because I've been getting free Dells from work. I found an x270 that I think hits all the marks for 600 on Amazon. Looking for feedback that is a deal breaker. Needs Small footprint. I travel for business and go back and forth from the office to home during covid. I prefer small laptops for that reason. 80% of the time it will be hooked up to a monitor. Legacy ports I work in IT and have to go to data centers fairly often. So ethernet ports and other legacy ports are pretty important. No need for SD cards or VGA. Would like a single USB-C port for charging bricks/phone. Specs I need i5 or higher 16gb of ram and 256-512 SSD does not need to be nvme . Prefer 512 SSD because I need to dual boot a basic Linux distro. Screen Don't care - not playing any media on this. Persona preference is matte also small. 13.3 max want smaller Battery will be plugged in most of the time not too concerned would still prefer 2-3 hour battery life to make things easier. Docking would prefer a bottom dock will to entertain USB C docks. Just need to dock when I'm in the office. This refurbished beefed up thinkpad seems to hit all the marks. Am I not thinking if anything that is a deal breaker? No gaming media editing or streaming will happen on this device. Strictly using network utilities RDP network scans etc. Is the x270 the best fit or am I missing something or a better model? Thanks!,0.037,0.82,0.143,0.9876,1,1

I have a few questions that I thought some of the experts here might be able to answer 1 Is the P73 enormous? I have a 15 work laptop Precision 5510 that I consider just a bit smaller than ideal. 2 For the P53 is there a clear winner between 4k IPS and 4k oled? I have an OLED TV and really like the picture but would be terrified of burn in. 3 I will mainly run photoshop and lightroom. There's a small chance I may need to run SolidWorks or do some machine learning but it will mostly be teaching myself those things. Is there a clear choice for graphic card in this situation? I think budget wise I could probably stretch to the RTX3000 but if that's wasted I can always save that money. I don't do games but might like to use it for non-gaming VR. 4 Is it crazy to get these models for personal use? Should I be looking at something else?

After buying it I found it throttled hard when trying to do anything with GPU load for more then 15-20 minutes. So I found this guide in a post on this sub Reddit I'd comment this there but its archived. I followed nopethefuckouts steps I didn't end up doing anything for overclocking or undervolting the CPU I just installed afterburner and adjusted the curve of the MX150 to his suggested amount. I found with those settings I still had the problem of it throttling often even after changing the in game resolution to 1366x768. So I thought I'd try something different. or practically all my computers I use them in the Maximum performance power profile in windows. What I have tried and it has so far worked great is I clicked on my battery icon on my tray and changed the slider for best performance to better performance or even best battery life. Changing that has caused my laptop to no longer throttle I've even been able to up the graphics a bit from 1366x768 in Overwatch to 1920x1080.

3,go2d9l,thinkpad,2,2020/05/22 10:32:38,Morning,Looking for a new laptop and could use some guidance Hi! I'm very fortunate to have gotten a hookup from a friend who works at Lenovo for a 76% discount to replace my beat-up ASUS and am a bit overwhelmed by all the options. I've never had any bells and whistles on my previous laptops but I am about to go back to school and want to use this opportunity to get something that will actually last. All I know for sure is that I want a Thinkpad for its durability with a great keyboard and 12-16 GB RAM. I made a spreadsheet comparing 19 different models which hasn't really helped narrow things down. I multitask a lot on my computer lots of browser tabs and different programs open at once but am not a gamer nor am I typically running huge tasks. I'm hard of hearing so a strong sound system is important just in terms of volume complexity of sound is less important . I'm looking for under 3000 for the web price. With the discount the most expensive one I'm looking at would be 690 which is still quite a bit more than I usually spend on a new laptop. I quite like having the touchscreen on my current laptop but I can go without it. I'd prefer something on the lighter more portable side but again not a dealbreaker. I have a 1 TB external drive so internal storage isn't hugely important to me. So some questions I've never had a laptop with over 250 nits so I'm not sure how drastic the difference between 250 300 400 and 500 is. I do know 250 is far too dim when I have to work in sunny spots but would 300 be enough or should I aim higher? What should I look for in an Intel processor? I don't really understand the difference between the generations or i5 vs i7. Is 8 MB cache that much better than 6 MB? Is it better to have two sticks of 8 GB RAM one 16 GB stick or does it even matter? I'd very much appreciate any recommendations both for specs and specific models.

Bought a mint X1 Carbon Gen 6 from abgemacht about 2 weeks ago and it’s absolutely fantastic. It has the HDR Dolby Vision panel and is an absolute joy to look at. I am however having zero luck getting Dolby Vision to actually work on it. I’ve googled like mad to try fixing it but end up with a dead end every time. Specific error when I use the Win 10 Netflix app or Edge on Netflix for example I’m greeted with a black screen that says “Dolby Vision playback is not authorized on this computer. Please uninstall Dolby Vision to remove this message” and the video never shows audio plays though . I’m updated on everything have ensured my display drivers are updated using the standard Lenovo .icc profile have downloaded and installed the WQHL drivers or whatever Netflix's FAQ recommends. Every thread I've found has no final solution people just ghost and stop posting. So does anyone have Dolby Vision working on their X1 Carbon 6th generation w/the Dolby Vision 500-nit panel?

Hi since I would like to develop apps for iOS I need a notebook with Mojave at least just to open Xcode and code in swift. I don't like the Apple notebooks because they cost too much for what they offer in particular because they are not made to last. And I say that while writing from a Macbook Pro 2019 with i9 processor that I've to return within a month. So since I like to thinker with things I would like to enjoy thinkpad family but I would like to start with a cost effective machine just to develop some apps until I can afford a real macbook if really need one. I want at least a 4/8 cpu but I don't know which thinkpads other than t440p support such cpus. I don't really mind a thick notebook but carrying an heavy machine while commuting on bike it's not super-nice. A good scalability of performance is something I would appreciate in particular to use the notebook at the university without staying close to a plug.

I suspect this wasn’t the best deal out there and I’ll be checking the site to see if the price drops over the next 30 days. My last laptop purchase was a T430 in 2012 so it’s been a while. I didn’t have as much time to do research so I’ve got a few questions remaining. 1. I saw that they released this Thinkbook line. It had better specs all around except battery life for a cheaper price! It took me a while to decide but I ended up going with the Thinkpad because that’s what I’m familiar with. Does anyone have an opinion of Thinkbook 15 vs. Thinkpad T580? Based on my research it seems like Thinkpads are just built to last longer. Hope I didn’t make a mistake. 2. Based on my specs what are the low hanging fruit upgrades I can make to the T580? I am contemplating a RAM upgrade to 16gb - is that worth it? I heard battery life is also not good. Should I be buying a larger battery? 3. Does anyone know what model RAM is included in the T580? Im wondering if I can just buy another single 8gb RAM or if I will have to buy 2x 8GB RAM. It seems like the 2x 8gb DDR4 2400 will run me about 70. 4. For the RAM upgrade I also saw that DDR4-2666 is compatible. If so should I be getting DDR4-2666? I’m not savvy on the specs.

2,gnvmgq,thinkpad,2,2020/05/22 04:04:34,Night,Yet another person going to uni asking for buying advice Hey folks I am sure that I am able to find good advice in this subreddit on what ThinkPad I should get. I hope for detailed responses and advice at that A bit of a backstory I'm currently a high school student that will graduate this summer. I plan to study geography later this year hence I plan a lot considering tech and stationeries so that I'll be well-prepared for studying. Related to the 'tech-thing' I would like to buy a new laptop and I do favour ThinkPads. I already own a T440p and it suits most of my needs but unfortunately not all of them. Overall I really appreciate how upgradable it is. I switched in an IPS FHD-display a new trackpad and a new keyboard. However it is not as portable as it was before. While I switched my TrackPad I did broke the connector cable which first caused weird bugs for instance my mouse just froze sometimes. When I attempted to fix it it stopped working at all. I bought several replacement cables and trackpads but either the cable did not fit or it just gave me error codes. I suppose the mainboard is bricked to some extent. But I will not attempt to repair it I think it is not worse the money any more. Likewise the performance is also disappointing sometimes. I do not game a lot but I cannot miss Minecraft or indie games such as Celeste or Terraria. But even these games rarely reach framerates above 40fps in low to medium settings. Maybe my OS Pop! OS is to blame I don't know. But despite the fact I do work and will have to when I will study geography with specific software such as QGIS which needs a fair amount of computing power. One might say I could just buy a T480 or something similar but I have some concerns relating the ThinkPad line which is why I don't know if my next laptop should really be a ThinkPad . The problems with the Thunderbolt chipset but also the upgrade-ability that you can't change the battery on some models that you have to buy a separate very expensive USB-C dock a new generation of ThinkPads coming this June all this made me insecure. For those who TL DR Thusly I will give a broad overview on what I need. If you have a specific model you would recommend or even to a specific point of time regarding the new ThinkPads coming soon just tell it. If you recommend a good laptop outside the ThinkPad line this is also completely fine . Please be aware that I would like to buy a used laptop for mainly ecological reasons.

Hey there I am currently using a Xiaomi Air 12.5 as my main device and in general I am really happy with the device. The only downside is the lack of screen size estate. I am going to the library more and more to write essays and papers instead of working at home on an external monitor so I'd prefer to have a bigger screen. I guess 14″ is the sweetspot for portability and screen size. Since I am going to take it with me a lot want to go for either the S models of T series or the Carbon X1. I'd like to spend around 400-450€. Found the X1 Carbon 3rd gen for around that price on Ebay in good condition. Click Is that a good deal or should I look for other models in specific? I don't really care about performance I use the device only for Office stuff as well as playing some LoL which runs fine on my current m3 7y30/4GB ram device.

50,gn9hnh,thinkpad,36,2020/05/21 03:14:34,Night,Lenovo QC is definitely not what it used to be. The new P53 arrived yesterday. Was kinda excited until I opened up to install my 128 GB of RAM and 970 EVO PRO drives. Now I’m kinda bummed. It looks like a pre-built system that they had lying around and had a trainee open her up to remove ram. I ordered it with only 8GB RAM because I have my own DDR4 32GB modules. The system probably comes with more than just 8GB pre-installed so they likely had to remove some. I’m kind of glad I did that or it would have been quite a while before I discovered what they did. One of the first things I noticed was slight evidence of fingerprints on the LCD cover. Ehhhh not a dealbreaker but definitely not like an “oh wow this machine has never been touched by bare human hands before” kinda feeling you should get when opening your PC for the first time. Next I went to install my RAM and discovered one of the screws securing the bottom access is not only missing the captive plastic washer so the screw falls out when you flip the cover upside down but it is also stripped out inside the chassis. We are already off to a pretty bad start. The first thing I noticed after opening the base cover was cosmetic. One of the plastic DIMM slot dust covers was crushed up like some amateur Simon Mall techie was in a big hurry to remove a RAM module and shoved their big fingers in there and crushed the cover up. I know cosmetics but it’s pointing towards a serious lack of attention to detail. I suspect the system was pre-installed with 4x8 32GB of RAM and they had to remove 3 modules to ship the system out. No big deal but kind of points towards a system sitting on the shelf as opposed to a built-to-order system. Next I noticed that there was no RAM installed in the main DIMM slot nearest the battery where single RAM modules are supposed to be installed. That means the single 8GB module that shipped with the system must be under the keyboard and therefore in the wrong DIMM slot. Concerning but not a huge deal considering I was swapping it out anyway. Edit while I understand this may be common practice for Lenovo it makes no sense to install a single RAM module under the keyboard which ultimately forces you to remove the keyboard no matter which RAM upgrade options you go for in the future. It is also contrary to the HMM instructions. I went ahead and popped open the keyboard which is way easier to do than the HMM makes it seem. I’m also pretty ticked that you officially need a special tool to remove and reinstall the keyboard. That’s kinda fucked up Lenovo. Not gonna lie that’s a dick move. Under there I found that both DIMM dust covers were installed crooked and off-center. Not only that but the lower one was installed way too far back which jammed the cover up under the chassis and made removing the RAM module unnecessarily difficult. I had to use a special tool just to pull that cover up without damaging it. I ended up removing both of these covers and reseated them in their correct placement. Then I went to install my RAM under the keyboard and that’s where the trouble started. The RAM in the top DIMM slot would not lock into place. The latch is damaged and does not snap into the RAM module like it should. Check out these pics to see what I’m talking about. I tried the new ram old Ram and the OEM Lenovo RAM. All did the same thing meaning something is funky with that entire DIMM slot. Tbh I could have lived with some of the other issues. The stripped out screw was a mess and I probably would have had to send the system back for the chassis issue but that DIMM slot issue is just not going to work for me. Going to be shipping this system back and let Lenovo know how I feel about this. I don’t mind the 5-8 week lead time if it means I get a system built to order not something that’s been sitting on the shelf and they have to do some funky modifications to it before shipping. That’s gonna be a hard pass. New update I went with the i9 RTX 4000 combo because I got both for a steal. As it turns out this is a totally pointless configuration. The system idles at 60-65 sitting flat on the table. Under load both CPU and GPU throttle moderately to 85-90% capacity while running at 85 for GPU and 95 for CPU. Not impressed with performance either for such a heavy build. I might repaste and undervolt out of curiosity but not looking too keen on keeping this particular config.,0.102,0.832,0.066,-0.9847,-1,0

3,gnjdsv,thinkpad,11,2020/05/21 12:37:50,Morning,Shinobi Initial Impressions Nice but Not Quite Right for me  My Shinobi came today order 15XX for those still waiting . It’s my first mechanical keyboard for context. It feels very solid and pretty heavy. Build quality is high. Aesthetically it really does it for me. I like the feel of the keys though I honestly prefer the ones on my T25 the tactile bump is a lot more defined than the one on the MX Browns and I’m a fan of the shorter travel. I will probably put o-rings on the Shinobi switches to help with that. The clit mouse feels quite a bit lighter and more responsive than others I’ve used. It’ll be an adjustment but I already like it a lot. I don’t love the TrackPoint buttons but also don’t find them to be bothersome. My only gripe - though it’s a big one - is some of the dimensions between the keys. The keys themselves seem to be longer along the y axis e.g. Fn-to-Esc axis than the standard 7-row ThinkPad keys. Critically from the middle of the home row ASDF keys to the near edge of the top surface on row 6 the distance is 53mm on the Shinobi vs 49mm on my T25 and X220. That messes with some important muscle memory for me especially hitting the Delete End and PgDn keys. On a standard ThinkPad keyboard I can hit them by pivoting - but not lifting - the base of my palm. Not so on the Shinobi. I’m also inadvertently hitting the arrow keys with my palm when I move my hand to hit keys in the Delete cluster because the arrow keys are lower down on the keyboard and come out prouder above the palm rest than those on a ThinkPad. Hitting the Y key and using Ctrl combinations is also more challenging because of the sculpted keycaps and longer travel. I’m making more typos than usual. I’ll probably be able to adjust somewhat but I suspect my hand size will limit how well i can adapt. I know they put a lot of effort into designing every aspect of this keyboard and that the F row has custom keycaps so I’m not sure why they didn’t get this right. If they made the diagonal lower wall of those 6th- and 7th-row keys more vertical to bring the top surface closer to my hands and/or made the gap between the 5th and 6th row narrower it would probably be fine. A higher palm rest relative to the keys might help as well. The reach issues are exacerbated by the additional travel of the mechanical switches. Adding o-rings or putting some thick neoprene on the palm rest might help. But I have to say I’m a bit disappointed as I was hoping to work this keyboard with muscle memory developed on the standard one. I’m loving the TrackPoint on the Shinobi but honestly think I’d be happier overall with an SK-8855. Unfortunately those are getting rare and are approaching the price of the Shinobi these days. I respect TEX a lot for having made this and am glad to live in a world where the Shinobi exists. I just wish it worked better for me.,0.035,0.784,0.18,0.998,1,1
2,gnmbpq,thinkpad,1,2020/05/21 16:12:08,Afternoon,Soooo... Maybe my Thunderbolt port does work? Or no? I've been fooling around with the Thunderbolt port on my T480 for weeks. Initially Lenovo thought I probably needed a logic board not the best option . I've downloaded and installed new drivefirmware BIOS settings removed Thunderbolt from the machine totally and redownloaded Thunderbolt / driver firmware. Etc. etc... My problem is that I've had a monitor plugged in via the Thunderbolt port for about a year and it has been working great. Then all of a sudden it stopped working. Today I tried to plug my Pixel 3A phone in with a usb c to usb c cable and I can transfer files just fine. When I plug in the display I'm using an adapter that goes from HDMI to USB C. So my question now is could it be possible that the little adapter has just failed? Do they fail? Will that port still work as a usb c port if Thunderbolt has failed? I DO see my display jump from my built-in display to the big one for a second when I plug in the cable but then the big one goes black again and it jumps back to my built-in display. Any help avoiding a new logic board would be greatly appreciated!,0.092,0.85,0.058,-0.5341,-1,0

X1 Yoga 3rd Gen Heating I have an X1 Yoga 3rd Gen with an i7 8650u and the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics along with 16 GB of RAM. I play some games on my laptop like Grand Theft Auto 5 Dark Souls 3 Rocket League etc. When I'm gaming the laptop heats up of course but it heats up to 99 C often and it stays in the 90s. I'm also using TPFanControl and the fan is set to fan64 above 90 C which is around 8000 RPM for me higher than the BIOS setting at those temperatures . I'm thinking that the air vents underneath the laptop are not good enough for cooling and I've been thinking of adding more but I haven't decided yet. I also reach consistent 80s when I'm on Skype or Zoom and using the laptop at the same time to work or watch a movie so I don't really think it's a gaming issue. This is a post with an image of an X1 Carbon's vents but it looks exactly the same on the X1 Yoga 3rd Gen with the fan in the same location I was thinking of adding vents above the fan like that user but in a more clean manner of course like this user The temps were already present before I started using TPFanControl. That's the reason I started using it because the temps were pretty high and the fan wasn't spinning fast enough in my opinion. Have any X1 Yoga 3rd Gen users done this? Any other ThinkPad user?

Was tired of the constant 2-3 year lifespan we get out of the standard “on sale” 400- 500 laptops read a handful of reviews and figured that even the cheapest Lenovo with a Ryzen 7 would be better than the Walmart special or whatever they’re peddling at Costco. Obviously price was still a factor so scoring the “best” processor on an E series for 700 seemed like a good idea at the time. Then I find this place and everyone is saying the E series isn’t as good. Is it still better than the Asus/HP laptops I’ve been buying? The whole point was getting something built slightly better than those so it would hold up longer. It’s still in the mail will be here tomorrow.

The current left Fn Ctrl placement on the keyboard is such a major point of grief for so many users and potential users. It is unbelievable how there isn't yet an option for the keyboard to be configured to the more common Ctrl Fn placement on the customisation page. Before all the diehards of the current configuration dismiss this concern take a look at the writings on the wall. The ThinkBooks and the latest ThinkPad X1 Fold all have the Ctrl key at the bottom left corner. Eventually Lenovo will have to make the default ThinkPad keyboard align with the industry.

I had to buy a laptop for school I'm studying sound design and I opted for a E595 since it was the only model with a high end processor ryzen 7 3700U and 16 gbs of ram at this pricetag I paid around 700 euros for my beauty . Fact is I love it for everyday use but there is something that keeps me from using it for its real purpose. Performance. I use a variety of programs which require ram and cpu most of my classmates which are composers and song writers use up to 64 gbs of ram but I have a problem with cpu usage in some of the programs I use. I had to do 2 things to kind of boost performance first of all cpu usage from the power option. I don't know why there's no high performance option on this laptop but only battery savers. I had to do one myself. And then my cpu clock was way behind the 2.3ghz base clock sitting at 1.70 even when my computer was under stress tests. I had to deactivate an option from the bios to get it working at 2.30/2.50 under stress but still I get high usage in some programs even when I'm in idle. I read something online about Ryzen requiring different attention working with ram speeds and other factors. Is there anything I can do to push this laptop to the performace I was hoping to get out from it? For reference my old desktop with ddr3 8gbs 1600mhz and an I7 4770k not overclocked always managed to use the same exact program ableton live 10 under 10% of cpu usage with various tracks 15/20 tracks . On my E595 i get 10% of cpu usage with one single track. I hope I can solve this and finally use this thinkpad to his maximum potential. Sorry for the long post,0.046,0.893,0.061,0.5734,1,1

I have been a ThinkPad owner since the IBM days and have continued purchasing them through the Lenovo acquisition although the market has changed since that acquisition. I have been loyal to the brand with all laptop PC - based purchases and Apple products as well which although made in China are owned in the US. I have been reading reports the US gov’t has stopped using ThinkPads due to an alleged backdoor which is concerning. Not sure if it was referring to Preload image or BIOS/UEFI level. Obviously this is concerning if true. Does anyone have or can cite credible evidence regarding this? Thanks!,0.032,0.866,0.101,0.8468,1,1
2,gnbphj,thinkpad,6,2020/05/21 05:52:11,Night,Looking for a laptop to learn programming with Unity. Could you awesome people suggest a laptop for me? Hi. After researching laptops I've come to appreciate the reliability customizations available and the community with Thinkpads. I'm looking to spend between 500 and 600 on a laptop that I can take to a coffee shop and learn some unity programming and maybe start some projects. Of course it would just be nice to have a laptop for trips as well. I like the idea of touchscreen so if I tried to make an Android app I could test things right with the touchscreen but is the added cost worth it? With my budget is added a touchscreen going to cost me too much in other areas? I want the best laptop for my price and battery life is a big factor along with a bright screen so I can sit outside in the shade and work. Is it worth buying a used/refurbished thinkpad if battery is important to me? Finding it on Amazon would be a plus but I'd pick one up from anywhere if the price is right. I have a desktop with an i5 CPU 8gb of RAM and and video card that runs all the games I play find so gaming isn't a factor with the laptop. Any help is really appreciated. I've heard that laptops are being overpriced atm since everyone is working from home but if you guys could help me find a good thinkpad I'd be super grateful!,0.0,0.785,0.215,0.9952,1,1

I do a lot of photo editing some gaming and generally a pretty heavy user. No matter what I do the bottom left hand side of the palmwrest where the gpu is gets to hot to use comfortably. Compared to my w530 I had the gpu overclocked and the fans turned down with tpfancontrol and it was perfectly fine. The w541 is both undervolted and underclocked yet with any moderate load it gets uncomfortable warm. The gpu isn't hot for a gpu at less than 75 Celsius but the palmwrest is burning hot for a human. I don't understand how people use the w541 without an external monitor. Furthermore after doing a lot of research before picking up the w541 I only heard this as a minor issue/afterthought.This is a fundamental design flaw for a laptop that is supposed to be pushed. So for all those thinking of picking a w540/41 either get the w530 or p50 this gen is shit. If anyone has any advice please feel free to lmk. Gonna sell this the next time I'm in the USA asap and pickup a w530 again or p50.,0.061,0.831,0.108,0.7814,1,1

So I recently bought my first USB-C hub HyperDrive 9-in-1 for use with my ThinkPad X1 Carbon and I’ve been having a couple of issues. 1. Everytime I connect the hub Windows shows an error saying “DisplayPort might not be supported” no monitor connected yet and occasionally “Device is not being charged” as well. Ran into a BSOD once as well. Does this mean the hub is faulty? The charger is 65W and the hub can technically provide 60W so shouldn’t be an issue no? Also tried with iPad Pro as well with no issues whatsoever. 2. A pair of speakers are used but at same levels volume is lower when the aux is through hub than through laptop directly. And sometime static bursts are heard in between. Works perfectly when connected via aux though. Fault of hub or speakers 10 years old speakers fyi ? 3. When power and aux are connected but hub is not connected to laptop there’s a horrible whine not static through the speakers. Why could this be so? 4. Laptop temperatures are running much higher than normal when charging through hub than direct all 4 cores have hit 100 Celsius peak average 85 minimum 67 and load under 20% Apologies for the long list but it’s my first hub and I so wanna embrace the one cable setup but if these problems are present I’d rather stick with multiple cables than risk damaging my laptop it’s a work system as well Thanks and cheers!,0.108,0.779,0.113,-0.6716,-1,0

Our lessons won't be special so we will touch Networks more serious programming maybe virtual machines etc. If there is a programmer what do you use it for and why is it better than the competition? I'm afraid that I won't use it to write heavier programmes but just to take notes.

Price matters but quality and longevity matter more. I don't want any soldered-in stuff. BIOS needs to be upgradable ??is this possible? . Need 8GB RAM and need decent CPU. If it has 2.0 USB ports I'd like to be able to put in 3.0. Will need 3 USB ports wifi adapter flashdrive and a Logitech unifier. The screen size may not be important not sure yet but I plan to have this in a backpack or other bag that might get jostled a bit so it needs to be sturdy. I will run Linux on it and probably bring a small wireless mouse with me. It doesn't have to have ethernet. Being able to replace ANY parts including broken screen or keys is important and I prefer to buy used parts. I think battery power may be a big deal so being able to replace the battery easily availability in buying it and changing it in the middle of the day may be important. I do not play games but i do lots of browsing and use LibreOffice a lot. I am assuming that a laptop is like a PC- that if it has an SSD capability that it can hold any size GB on it. Not sure if power supply is affected by GB size of SSD. I think I only need 125 GBs anyway....or even less. Oh I 'd like to edit videos using Shotcut if possible - but it isn't a must. If I left out anything that I should be considering let me know. I may be using this as a second or third screen at home.

I tried it two times first step charges successfully to 100% and in both causes the second step discharges to around 5% takes around 5 hours but then the calibration stops the message is Incomplete. AC power adapter was detached. and then the laptop starts charging again. I don't know if it makes any difference but I have the laptop running in peformance profile while doing the test just to make it faster. first time I thought that the adapter was not plugged in correctly but after the second time I'm worried that it might be related to the adapter itself or the laptop.

Hey all I just tried to replace my X240's clunkpad with this trackpad Install went okay except none of the guides mentioned that the stupid connector on these had a black clasp/clamp so for awhile I was just shoving it out/in trying to get it seated. Anyway I have it properly seated/clamped now and it's not showing up in Ubuntu or when I booted a Windows 10 install from USB. Not seeing it in /proc/bus/input/devices so the kernel doesn't even see the hardware. Also the trackpoint isn't working on the keyboard anymore. The keyboard still works fine though. Any ideas? Did I screw up the new connector or ribbon cable by not properly using the black clasp to unclamp/clamp the cable? The cable feels pretty resilient.. but I'm worried I cut a pin or maybe damaged something during removal. Photo of the cable how it's currently seated x200B Edit Just tried plugging back in my old clunkpad... also not working. Uh oh. I think I may have either damaged the cable/motherboard or accidentally removed a cable. See the rear connection on the rear of the clunkpad that came up when I removed it from the palmrest assembly I'm starting to think this palmrest assembly is only compatible with the clunkpad's wiring setup.

This is my 4th ThinkPad but my first one bought new so naturally I'm buzzing. I'm retiring an X121e a faithful i3 2nd gen servant of 2011 vintage where one of the hinges is giving up. First thing I did on the X395 was wipe Windows and install Ubuntu 20.04. I ran Mint on my old X121e. I knew I only wanted Linux on my X395 but I'd read that Ryzen support isn't the best with older Kernels so I just wanted something that worked. So far it seems to work just fine. Would be great to swap notes with other X395 owners especially those running Ubuntu. Also mine didn't come with an ethernet adaptor in the box. I'd seen reviews where it did and so maybe I assumed it would come with one but it didn't.

2,gmu0qt,thinkpad,10,2020/05/20 10:17:46,Morning,Is key damage covered under warranty? Typing this kinda pissed from my P52s. Previously the up arrow key developed a flaw where if it were pressed from a corner as opposed to the center it would pop off. Pressing it back would snap it back in place until you inevitably hit the corner again. This problem kept getting worse until finally any keypress from center or side would result in the key coming out and it became increasingly difficult to snap it back in. At this point I went to my university's campus shop which happens to also be a Lenovo service provider. The guy over there straight up pulled an up arrow key from a donor keyboard and put it in mine and told me to come back if there were any more issues. Fine by me as long as it worked. Now the same issue has started to crop up in the right arrow key. I hit it from the corner with my pinky and it just pops right off. It pops right back on again but no doubt this will get worse just like the up arrow did. Is this kinda damage covered under warranty or does it count as regular wear and tear ? I'd ideally like the entire keyboard replaced cause there's no telling what key gives way next. I didn't use it in any excessive/extreme way to my knowledge. Side note I'm super unhappy with this keyboard. It feels good to type on but on top of this key pop off issue the backlight of the keys bleeds all over and the Enter key stabilization is getting worse with use really quickly. I thought ThinkPads were built to last but so far it seems that my roommate's 2018 MacBook Pro with the problematic keyboard is doing better than my machine.,0.115,0.802,0.083,-0.8786,-1,0

I usually don’t shut it down and rather send it to standby. However when external screen is connected it comes back on from standby randomly. When it does external screen might have some weird colors like it lights up and is all purple or light blue sometimes with weird lines as if it is broken. However when I wake it up by touching the keyboard or a mouse it goes back to Windows login screen and all is normal. Any suggestions on how to prevent it from waking up the laptop? At first I thought it is either the mouse or the keyboard that brings the device back on but that isn’t the case because I’ve tested it and it does not happen.,0.033,0.948,0.019,-0.2382,-1,0

When I run multi-threaded benchmarks instead of staying at 3.9-4.0 GHz my CPU drops to 3.4-3.5 GHz although the temperature is the same as before. Other CPU-related tests like 3DMark also showed a significantly lower score. All the power settings and related are the same. I even did a system restore to before a recent Windows update.

So I finally decided to try the classic KB mod for my x230 and bought a broken x220 which turned out to work fine after putting in some spare memory and HDD. Plucked out the KB and proceeded to do insulate the pinouts. Unfortunately grubby fingers as I am it seems I bent one or more of the flaps too much and now they don't firmly connect. Trying it back on the x220 columns for 4RFV 5TGB 9OL. the entire right column backspace enter RShift and occasionally the spacebar and touchpad buttons were not working. Fiddling around i noticed that if I held the two metal flaps together with a grip the buttons reliably work. I tought I might have used a rather thick tape but removing it and wiping away the glue did not change the situation. This suggests that the flaps themselves are too permanently bent. I wanted to know if anyone has faced this problem before and how they solve it. Thought it's better to ask for help before I inevitably strip the screws and further mess up.

6,gml071,thinkpad,9,2020/05/20 01:02:50,Night,Got a ThinkPad W541 for a few months now. Had a Macbook Pro before this. And a ThinkPad T580 before that. Are all modern laptops shit now? Let's go over some laptops I've used. T530 Before the T580 I had a T530. No nonsense. Quite fast heavy sturdy. Didn't throttle. Accepted all mods I threw into it. SSD's? Sure. New RAM? Sure. HDD in caddy? Sure. New WiFi chip? Sure. New keyboard? Affirmative. T580 The T530 was a great device. But it was getting slow for more intensive apps. So I went to the T580. Nice but sometimes it wouldn't boot with an NVMe error. When you flexed the right side of the device when you picked up the laptop basically it would BSOD. It would throttle after 30 seconds of playing intensive games the heating just couldn't keep up. Had to undervolt it and do other tweaks because benchmarks showed it was not doing much better than T580's with the 8250u I had 8550u thanks to shit cooling. Wasn't the most solid laptop either I did come from a T530... Sold it because I didn't feel like it was a 'ThinkPad-worthy' device in comparison with my T530. MacBook Pro Amazing solid aluminum build. Amazingly smooth operating system. Fantastic audio insanely good display. Very smooth experience just great. But the performance wasn't great especially not for the money. Gaming performance was horrific. Could't even relax properly after a long day of working. Well okay no gaming then. I can still use it for my video prod-- oh no when I plug in my external HDD there is interference. I could literally not use external monitors or HDD's because the USB C combo with the aluminum shell caused interference which killed my internet. Rare problem but I am not alone others have this too online. I miss upgradeability and you know ports . W541 Welcome back ThinkPad! Bought this because I don't want to keep switching. Threw my desktop out and I finally have something branded as a mobile workstation desktop replacement . Sounds great. Hmm there is a bit of flex in the build but whatever. Then I found out that sometimes because of course only sometimes the internal HDD caddy doesn't get seen and I have to reboot it often twice before it sees it again. Oh and when you install it into the Ultra Dock there's a horrible coil whine. Oh and if you play games newer than 2005 then it will throttle the GPU heavily after approx 30 sec of playing and you will get 10FPS. Want to replace the WiFi chip? Can't! Because it's whitelisted! Oh no you spilled water over the spill-proof keyboard? Even though it was just a couple of drops and we have d-d-d-d-drainage hooolesss now half your keyboard won't work! Oh man time to blow the fan really loudly in idle! Question Are all modern laptops incompetent? Aren't there any true workstation ThinkPads that DON'T throttle?

Same result with a second CPU of the same type. I have poked around at the speed step settings in the BIOS etc but nothing changes... Can someone smarter than me tell me what might be wrong?

Sorry for the the long winded post here. x200B I have the i7-8550U X1C6 16GB Ram 512 SSD and currently running Win10 The system seems to run a little hot and seems to thermal throttle quite a bit.

The occasional Steam game here and there.

In theory dual booting should NOT affect any performance when running either OS correct? For those of you who moved completely to Linux and play with Windows users what packages are you using to replace Microsoft Office the Adobe Suite or other Windows only packages.

My two previous laptops have been a Thinkpad P50 loved the laptop the off-center keyboard got to me after a while though. and a dell studio XPS 16 from back when I was a student. All 3 laptops have been 1200. and had at the time of purchase had decent specs I have used 1 HP laptop and several macbooks at work over the last 10-12 years. Currently use a MBP 16 at work. I'm really excited to see the new Dell XPS 15. The reason I bought the P1 apart from the great specs for a good price were the option to upgrade. upgrade RAM SSD over time . The port selection is excellent the keyboard is a dream to type on compared to most other available keyboards and the laptop is for my purposes light enough. What I don't like about Lenovo laptops are the mediocre displays they put on most of them. I'm also not as much a fan of 16 9 as I am of 16 10. My P1 currently has a FullHD display which I chose for longer battery life. I also don't think I need 4K in a 15 screen - I'm not pixel peeping while consuming entertainment on it. However I would like a color accurate display. The lower end P and X series fall flat on this. The new XPS can be had starting 1299 and seems to have user upgrade-able SSD and RAM. Dell also seems to price their customization's more reasonably than Lenovo does. X1 Extreme starts at 1549 currently with 9th gen processor. although dedicated graphics card. I put two configurations side by side. They cost roughly the same but I think the Dell XPS15 might edge out the X1 Extreme ever so slightly. Thoughts ? ,0.021,0.907,0.072,0.917,1,1

Hey all I'm currently in the process of searching for an FHD IPS display to replace the horrendous HD TN panel from IVO in my X260. The general consensus I'm seeing is that the LP125WF2 SP B2 is the best replacement available in terms of both quality and physical size compatibility. Are there any other display models that I should be considering or is the LP125WF2 SP B2 the very best display available for the X260? Thanks!,0.039,0.796,0.165,0.9239,1,1

Is the SSD and RAM soldered onto the Thinkpad X1 Yoga Gen 4? I have been looking at this laptop as an upgrade from my X220 but Lenovo charges almost 4 times as high as the market rate for both RAM and SSD. My X220 from 2011 has a 1TB SSD and 16 GB of ram. However getting the same on an X1 Yoga Gen 4 lands me north of 2000. Adding in the 4G moden which my X220 has the price goes even further. Are these new Thinkpads still as reliable as the old? Could a fully specced X1 Yoga Gen 4 last me 9-10 years just as my X220 has? If not I'll upgrade the X220 to 1080p HD and stick with it. EDIT Upon further thought it seems sticking with an X220 and doing upgrades and hacks might be the way to go until someone releases a laptop that can compare in terms of expandability and build quality. There's such a big second hard market for old Thinkpads and spare parts that an X220 could probably last another 5-10 years.,0.035,0.965,0.0,-0.7393,-1,0

6,gmcg9k,thinkpad,7,2020/05/19 15:03:41,Afternoon,Maybe buying my first ThinkPad but could do with some advice please! Hi all I'm in the market for a 2nd hand laptop and I'm wondering if and which ThinkPad might be best for me. I'm looking to spend around 300-400 but obviously less is better! I'm looking for something which might be a reasonable comparison to my experiences with a Dell XPS13 9360. Long story short I had one with an i7-7500u 16GB 1TB NVMe 3200x1800 from my previous job but had to give it back when I was made redundant and I'm missing it terribly trying to make do with an HP 2530p Core2Duo is just hell! I know I won't get a direct comparison to the XPS13 at this price range unless I'm mistaken which will of course be a huge bonus! but I never no doubt I can get better than that HP! My primary usage will be ECU tuning logging in my cars but also some home use for web browsing and a little light development work with the likes of VScode or Arduino IDE and carry around the house when I'm playing with my home automation stuff. Something that can sit next to the sofa that I can just pick up turn on and will be ready to go in a few 20-30 seconds I never put a laptop into standby I always shut it down when finished - I had an old 17 behemoth of a laptop wake itself up from sleep a few years back and overheat itself in my bag . My primary wishlist items are something that's lightweight enough to hold in one hand when picking up from the passenger seat not while driving I assure you! has a high resolution screen that I can see in bright light and good battery life but with some CPU power available if I need it and at least 8gb memory. The XPS would mostly last a full weekend at the drag strip powered up not in standby and logging from the ECU most of the time with the screen off granted plus a little reviewing of logs and tweaking in the fire up lane between runs. The higher screen resolution was good as it meant I could fit more data onto the screen at any one time plus even multitask when developing despite the small screen size. I'd initially been eyeing up the X270 as it seemed to have a reasonably modern CPU for the better power consumption and as the screen has bigger bezels than the XPS13 the 12.5 screen with an option of a FHD IPS screen seemed a reasonable compromise as I've not seen a higher resolution screen thus far in my searching certainly not in my price range... Plus my wife has an X270 as her work machine so I've been able to carry it around a bit and get an idea for how it sits in the hand and on my lap with the weight... I didn't actually realise this is what she had until after I'd done some of my own research! However this thought was scuppered slightly when looking around this sub today and seeing a few posts seemingly criticising anything newer than the X240… I also briefly considered the 3 range for the 13.3 screen but then with the bezels started to get a bit bigger than I'd ideally been looking for but I could be persuaded... I don't think I want to step up to a 14 or bigger screen. I don't need a huge amount of CPU power I have a reasonable desktop with triple monitors for more intensive stuff but want it reasonably snappy during my day to day use. So any advice comments or information greatly appreciated!,0.048,0.822,0.131,0.9956,1,1

I've used Linux for years on a few older ThinkPads before and on my desktop as well usually Mint but I'm pretty comfortable in anything Debian- or Ubuntu-like . So when work offered to hook me up with a brand new ThinkPad I was rather excited to get a Linux setup going on brand-new hardware. On the other hand though this is the first time in a long while that I've had to worry about a Linux install being able to support new hardware and the last time was on a desktop PC. This new ThinkPad came loaded-out with just about everything 10th gen i7 Nvidia GPU 1440p screen and almost every other option available for the model. So I need to know what it's going to take to be able to squeeze some decent battery life out of the laptop. I see battery life on the T490 is rated for up to 16.11 hours but that's on Windows and I'm sure it's overly optimistic. But if I can get even 60% of that I can still have an all-day laptop and that's my goal. So I'm hoping someone out there has already taken on this challenege and figured out the best way to approach it. Also I have Thunderbolt docks to use it in desktop mode when I'm at home or work so I'm hoping that's either not an issue in Linux or someone has any tips to share if it is. x200B Thanks for the help!,0.013,0.798,0.189,0.9949,1,1

As of an hour ago...this is the third time in less than 6 months of being new from factory my T490 won’t come back from a system update. Each time it has done something strange where it wouldn’t restart until some odd series of events happened. First time was a BIOS update but the last two times were some kind of standard firmware update. First time it sat for almost 10 days while Lenovo’s horrible next day site service faltered only for it to magically boot up after being unplugged for a week. Second time it wouldn’t go past a black screen wouldn’t hard reboot no access to battery to take out only for me to finally press the docking station power and presto.

As far as I can tell it's kind of a piece of junk. The keyboard was not great – it quickly developed an obnoxious squeaking and grinding noise apparently this is common and it beeped at me all the time. The trackpoint nipple was drifting also common and every time it began drifting it would disable the trackpad. The monitor is freaking awful! It's so dim the colors are so flat it's practically grayscale and the ghosting is insanely bad. Not worth the 1500 I spent on it. Pretty unacceptable quality for such a high price. I managed to get a refund after the seller tried to screw me out of 500. For anyone considering buying a Thinkpad...... don't.,0.148,0.83,0.022,-0.9498,-1,0

I'm really hoping that someone in this community can help me. I recently bought a Lenovo Thinkpad T61 with the notorious Nvidia GPU failure issue. The unit was in mint condition but will need a replacement motherboard to become functional. My issue is that for some reason and don't ask me why but somehow in the life of this laptop someone removed ALL the stickers from the bottom of the laptop. And when i mean all i mean all. No model or s/n to be had anywhere. There is one number stamped into the case which was 7663 which denotes that it's a 14.1 widescreen model but that's it. Is there anywhere else on the computer that the full model number i.e. 7663-CTO is stamped as well as the s/n?? I can't log onto Lenovo's support site to have them detect my hardware since the unit is non-functional. There is NO stickers under the removable battery and i haven't taken the unit apart yet to see if it's stamped on the ram cover.

A while back I got my x220t for a steal at 50 something I will brag about until I'm in my grave. It's been great so far and has been a huge upgrade over my previous HP stream. My main goal is to upgrade it into a decent / semi-decent video editing PC. At the top of the list is replacing the motherboard with an x230t i7-3520m. Below that is setting up an external GPU which I also have questions about. I've done LOTS of research as this is my first build ever but there doesn't seem to be a lot of information floating around about a board swap like this compared to the non-tablet models. Apparently the LCD cables don't match? I'm not sure. Is there a guide for this somewhere? And do you guys know all the differences between the x220t and x230t that I should look out for? Also on a side note for the GPU I am aware of the express card adapters that connect it to the computer but I just can't wrap my head around what graphics card to buy. There's so many options and configurations too much for my pea-sized monkey brain to understand. What would you guys recommend for what I'm trying to do?

I recently learned that all Ivy-Bridge/Haswell Intel iGPUs have been basically nerfed and their performance have been reduced by up to 50% and that made me kinda regret ordering a T440P since it has an Haswell based architecture and that means that it would be barely usable for my what I should do with it.

I need to get a new laptop and would like to get a windows laptop as I prefer the OS I have a windows desktop also so I'm not a fully mac person . I've been trying to get a X1C7/X1C8 virtually the exact same darn model! but the display options are abysmal. -The 1080 FHD has bad ghosting issues on multiple replacements I tried display replacement then device replacement . Many people have mentioned this issue on the forums so it is a major problem with low-powered displays in general. -The WQHD is only 300 nits and seems to have a kinda dullness to it i've seen reports of a dull yellowness and here to it as well as being fairly hopeless in brightly lit natural lighting conditions . The X1C6 WQHD-HDR was beautiful and 500 nits - but it was glossy as all hell. -The 4K model colour and contrast also looks impecible but its glossiness looks awful and most people on reddit report nearly half the battery life compared to 1080 FHD. Plus some lagginess to MS applications etc have been reported on forums. -Moving from 16 9 to 16 10 or 3 2 aspect ratio is also a no-brainer but not a dealbreaker I suppose. They were even strongly considering it as early as 2018 but still no changes. Just the same shitty displays for reasons above . I love so much about the X1C the keyboard the ports the slim and lightness make it the best laptop on market in my mind. But it is 2020 and we should not have displays that look like they were made in 2010 on high-end laptops. Will X1C9 rumoured to be released 2020 Q4 be a fix to all these display issues? That rumour in the link indicates there will be a few different forms of X1C so most likely will require different displays . Hopefully that means an improvement. Hopefully the X1C9 will be new displays? Somehow I think theyre going to stick with these crumby ghosting low-powered displays because their only relevent corporate clients are probably less concerned about it. Is it worth holding out for or do I just bootcamp a 2020 macbook pro? Cos my current macbook has lasted so nicely over the years and MBP displays are fantastic with less gloss and very good battery life.

I am a die hard Thinpad fan already owning a T530 and a T440s with several in the past. I am in the market right now to replace the T530 and had settled on the X1 Extreme. I have offered to donate my T530 to a family member who has just lost their job so they can use it to look for jobs. I was just ready to press the buy button on the X1E until I realised there is a new Dell XPS 15 out. Comparing the two I can only see one reason to get the X1E the keyboard. Apart from the Thinkpad keyboard which admittedly I do prefer a lot the new XPS 15 seems to beat the X1E in most ways. It has a newer CPU 10750H vs 9750H faster GPU 1650 Ti MQ vs 1650 MQ better battery life 97wh vs 80wh onsite rather than RTB warranty I have used Dell warranty for my monitor and it's fantastic . There is also one other absolute killer reason to buy it 16 10 aspect ratio on the XPS rather than 16 9 on the X1E 1920x1200 vs 1920x1080 for FHD . Apart from the looks I prefer the Thinkpad and the keyboard far better I simply can't see a reason any more to get the X1E. Am I missing something? I really want the X1E but my head tells me to get the XPS. I guess the only reason might be if I can get a better price on the X1E somehow. x200B ,0.037,0.905,0.058,0.6764,1,1

Seeming as both of them have that dedicated slot where you can insert an Egpu is as future proof as it is going to get for me.

1,gm3v74,thinkpad,1,2020/05/19 07:44:39,Morning,X250 Screen Replacement/Backlight Hi all Having some slight issues with my Thinkpad X250. x200B All was well with it until one of my family members borrowed it. Our cat somehow managed to jump up onto where the laptop was located and landed on the top half of the keyboard . Instantly the screen display appeared very odd and distorted very similar to 'internal glass crack' symptoms in this link . x200B I ordered a new screen off of eBay and swapped the displays. While the new display worked fine it was only visible when I shone an external light source on it ie. phone light . After googling the issue it turns out that I'm an idiot and forgot to disable the internal battery inside the BIOS... I have since done so and swapped out the new replacement screen for the old screen to see if the backlight is broken for both. There was no display at all on the old screen could not even see the distortions that appeared before the swap . Plugging the laptop into an external monitor via VGA cable works fine I boot into windows just fine and operate the laptop normally. I thought about trying another screen but I believe the issue is the backlight fuse or a slight possibility of the LCD cable - do you think this is the case? Would you suggest I try another replacement screen first or just send the laptop out to have the fuse repaired bearing in mind the replacement screen was 40 fuse repair costs when the laptop was only bought for 200 . Thank you!,0.036,0.923,0.04,-0.1206,-1,0

The Lenovo specs say that the X1E can support up to 4 external monitors Max resolution 5K 60Hz Thunderbolt 4K 60Hz HDMI . The laptop has two Thunderbolt 3s and an HDMI port. It also supports Miracast. x200B I haven't decided on what monitors because I would like to explore what is possible. I've heard of some people having issues with multiple monitors with the X1E before so I'd like to make sure it will all work before I order things. x200B How good is Miracast? Is it advisable to try to go with three Miracast compatible monitors the no cable aesthetic appeals to me ? Or should I try three 1080i monitors two vertical one horizontal or could I get away with 3 4ks even? Will I need a dock which one? or can I just use the current three ports? Any monitor array's you guys prefer? x200B I've been using a regular tv as a second monitor but it is having issues where it will cut out randomly particularily when the system is under load .

Only reason I say 1st gen is because current gen is super expensive - too much for my 1200 budget. For background I'm an incoming computer science freshman. I don't think the CS curriculum will be too resource-intensive so my need for performance mainly stems from my hobbies. I play some modded Minecraft think FTB Revelation do some Photoshop work and use audio editing/mastering software like Audacity with future plans to use software like FL Studio or RX 7 . I'm sure all three machines are overkill but needless to say I like to future-proof. So here are the main differences I've noticed P52 ThiccPad so there's more room for cooling but I'm concerned about the weight from toting it all over campus Definitely a workstation Quadro GPU Removable battery P1 Much more thin but I'm concerned about cooling Workstation Quadro Not easily removable battery X1E Also thin and therefore a cooling concern here as well Closer to a gaming ThinkPad than a workstation GTX 1050 Not easily removable battery I'm also concerned about the battery life on all three options but I suppose I can't have my cake and eat it too - I've got to make some compromises on battery life with the performance I'm seeking.

Yay for that. Result is that the screen is shattered and ripped of including the hinges. Keyboard and touchpad are toasted do not respond/trackpad cracked and the top shelf case has several deep dents. So basically a goner. However the core machine is fine. When hooked up via USB-C it performed several stress tests including Prime95 just fine. Since the machine has a nice i5-8250U I am really hesitant to just throw the machine into the garbage just yet. So I thought of converting it into a desktop. My father needs a replacement for his aging i5-2400 and I think this barebone would be a nice path to do just that. He is just doing browsing and microsoft Office anyway so this would work really well. However I was wondering about two things Is it possible to connect a different fan to the header on the motherboard or does the system go nuts when it detects something other than factory default? I just believe that a more powerful desktop-class cooler would be better suited given the additional space and would allow for a more quiet operation. And secondly My idea basically is to turn this into an all-in-one machine for my dad. He has a nice enough 27 1440p IPS Panel with a vesa mount and I like the idea of attaching this machine to the back of it. Has someone maybe already done this are there build logs to find somewhere? I am just curious to find out what issues might occur down the road before I get started and pump money and time into it. Like i.e. is the motherboard happy booting without a keyboard and touchpad attached? Are there know issues to look out for?,0.032,0.833,0.135,0.9836,1,1

It showed the usual The battery has failed due to normal wear. The battery can not be charged.Replace the battery . After reading posts here and some other information I decided to replace the battery for a new one. Once I installed the new battery the second it reached the 100% the same issue showed battery fails due to normal wear... Now I am concern that it may be something wrong with the laptop itself or even the charger as I have replaced it a year ago for an original one with the same V and A specifications but with a higher Wh the company from where I bought it said that if V and A are the same a higher Wh should not be an issue . Original charger 20V - 3.25A and 45Wh Replacement charger 20V - 3.25A and 65Wh What would be your guess here? Is it a coincidence and the new battery came faulty is there something wring with the laptop? Is it possible that the charger has ruined both batteries and if so hos is possible that the first one lasted for a year and the new one failed after a single charge?

So a few days ago I made this post asking about a T460 but it was sold out before I could figure out if it was worth it. Today I took a look and they're back in stock and as luck would have it I found another T460 for a similar price. One thing I noticed was a lot of people recommended getting something with full 1080p instead of the 1366x768. The second I'll call it the 'new' one to avoid confusion T460 has 1080P but it's only running windows 7 pro and the warranty is 180 days compared to the 18 month warranty the original had. I took a look at my current laptops specs and found I'm only using around 90GB of hard drive space right now so a 180SSD sounds like it should be enough. My main concern is whether windows 7 pro is any good compared to windows 10 pro my current laptop is running. I found you can buy windows 10 online for pretty cheap I did a quick google shopping search and found windows 10 pro license key for anywhere from 5 to 20 the license key gets you the actual operating system right? and I found a windows 10 pro DVD-rom for 40 maybe I could find it cheaper if I shop around . I put a table with some of the specs that are different between the two below hopefully that helps. x200B x200B Model T460.I5.8.180SSD.PRO T460.I5.8.500.PRO - - - Price 346.99 335.99 RAM/Type 8GB/DDR4 8GB/Not Specified SSD size 180GB 256GB USB x3 USB 3.0 Not specified Webcam yes no HDMI Mini-HDMI output Not specified Screen Type LED widescreen LCD Screen Resolution 1920 x 1080 Full HD 1366 x 768 HD Operating system Windows 7 Pro Windows 10 pro Warranty 180 days 18 months TL DR I'm trying to decide between the two Thinkpad T460 laptops noted above. I'm wondering if having the HDMI output and full HD LED display is worth the lower SSD size the older operating system that I might upgrade if I go with the 180GB and the shorter warranty.

1,glh7wf,thinkpad,2,2020/05/18 07:25:01,Morning,My new to me T470 and a couple of questions regarding screen replacement and RAM upgrade. Hi thinkpad. I want to share my new to me T470. I bought it as an upgrade to my X1C that I also bought 2nd hand 2 years ago. The new to me T470 My X1C I bought the T470 for what I thought was a good deal 320USD for where I live in SEA . I had a good experience when I bought X1C the seller was very informative and wrote a detailed product description. This time I bought from a different seller who was less informative. I was also more careless. So I found out late that this is the lower spec version. I was aware of the lower spec processor 6300U but I didn't expect was that the screen was only 768p it seems to be of lower quality than the one in my much older X1C1 and it bleeds on the lower right corner. I really thought that I'd finally get a screen upgrade lol. The other thing is that the keyboard is not backlit. But overall compared to the upgrades that I get I think this laptop is still very worth it The processor is still a big upgrade from the 3427U. RAM upgrade-ability. Double the SSD size also upgradeable if I want. HDMI and Ethernet port! I love this. I can now charge my laptop using USB-C! I already own a Baseus 65W GaN charger so I can now bring only one charger with me to charge everything my phone my laptop my tablet my headphone etc . Using a dongle I can even use 3 monitors at once this is a first for me haha. I also have two questions that hopefully thinkpad can help me with 1. I searched for a replacement screen spare-part. I found one that is 1080p but the seller warned me that if I replace the screen with a higher res screen than factory spec there's a chance that I wont be able to change the brightness. Is this true? I'm a little worried about upgrading the screen now. 2. I'm also planning to upgrade my RAM. The one installed is 8GB DDR4 2133MHz but I read that T470 is supposed to support DDR4 2400MHz. If I want to upgrade is it ok to use DDR4 2400MHz? Or should I stick to DDR4 2133Mhz? Thank you so much in advance for the help.,0.038,0.818,0.143,0.9919,1,1

I wanted to get your thoughts on the screen however. I'm considering the WQHD vs the FHD non-touch due to the resolution but I'm wondering if the 300 vs 400 nits is really that big of a difference any take on this? I don' want the 4k because I heard that they are prone to flicker. Full disclosure I'm embedded in the apple eco-system and I'm coming from a mbpro but I don't mind switching to Windows. Like many before me and many after I made the terrible mistake of sinking a lot of money into a late 2016 mbpro 15 model with that god awful keyboard and the no-esc key. So I've been thinking of sticking with Apple because the new 13/14 mbpro's will supposedly significantly improved their keyboards BUT the reason for considering a Windows laptop in the first place is primarily due to Windows and the recent amazing changes surrounding WSL 2.0. Also I use a VM a lot on my mac and it runs seamlessly do any of you have the same experience when running it under Windows?

0,glfv5u,thinkpad,2,2020/05/18 06:01:06,Night,Consultation on getting new Thinkpad your thoughts/experience/insight are greatly appreciated. I have been using a T520 since early 2012 and it has served me well. I have upgraded the RAM to 16 gb and have a SSD in the original drive bay and an HDD in the ultrabay 1 TB each . It still works for most basic tasks but is starting to get very choppy when I edit the occasional video or do graphically intensive tasks. It also overheats when I try to watch 1440p video. It has lasted 8 years and was used a year by a family member before given to me . I am looking to upgrade to a Thinkpad that will hopefully last another 9 years. I have always wished the graphics were better in the current laptop and therefore I want to get one with a dedicated graphics card I also appreciate the modular nature of this laptop and how I have been able to increase RAM and drive space as my use case has required. I therefore do not want soldered RAM. I also want a laptop that is futureproof in the sense that it is overpowered now but will not be so in 5 years. I love the fact that my T520 is still going strong. With these conditions in mind I have been drawn to the P series laptops as they have multiple drive bays and 4 slots for RAM without any Soldering. I am particularly drawn to the P73 as I can have an RTX 3000 card in it with the i7 and still have the space for a 2.5 drive which the P53 does not offer I will put my current SSD that I am using in my T520 in the new laptop . Plus a 17 screen is attractive as I am largely sedentary at my desk. I will have it connected to a 27 1440p external monitor. I can also get more for less money with the P73 over the P53 mainly the RTX 3000 option which isn't there with the P53 . My main questions are 1. Will the P73 have the same durability that my T520 has had? My assumption is yes 2. I am tempted to go for the 4k screen as I will not be mobile and will have it plugged in most of the time and I do occasionally edit video. Also in 5 years I can see where 4k will have become much more common. If battery life and gaming are not an issue are there any reasons for me not to get the 4k screen? Are scaling issues really that prevalent? Also the FHD option on the P73 the only other screen option is somewhat underwhelming. 3. Should I wait for the P17 specs to be released? Or if I see a good price for the P73 on the memorial day sale should I go ahead and buy it? 4. Should I get a 16gb RAM stick or 2 8 GB sticks? I plan to upgrade the RAM in the future 5. Are the heating issues of the P73/P53 really bad enough to warrant not purchasing/waiting to see if the new P line updates have improved the cooling solution? I will not engage in prolonged/sustained heavy graphical work but will run programs such as BlueStacks and edit video up to 4k resolution.

After using USG thinkpads for a while I became a convert and recently purchased my very own for quite an obscene sum of money with the rtx5000 and xeon. With my quadro 5000 I have observed some very strange behavior that I'm wondering if anyone is also experiencing or knows if it is only the symptom of a software problem or a sign of a more concerning hardware problem. When idle and sometimes while under load the gpu temperature pulses from a false reading of 0.0c to true temp. I'm unsure in the chicken/egg scenario if this is affecting the clock or vice versa but both clocks are also exhibiting a pulsing behavior. The scope of the problem is even more alarming if I use a monitor that does 100ms ticks. Idle Immediately resumes upon leaving a load Nvidia drivers BIOS chip set windows etc are all up to date and I've had the computer less than a week. I reached out directly to nvidia and they said quadro shouldn't be doing that but didn't offer anything more constructive. I have a ticket in with Lenovo but haven't heard back yet. Troubleshooting I've tried enabling/disabling hybrid or discrete graphics only to see if it's some sort of argument between Intel graphics and the GPU but that doesn't seem to affect anything.

I tried drivers for Vista but they seems to not work leaving me with Basic Graphics Card and drivers from Windows Update doesn't have support for OpenGL. Reason I want to stick with Win10 is that it's really faster than Win7 even if the available ram is half of whats installed D That's strange.. For example - Minecraft on Win7 worked perfectly - so the Microsoft drivers HAD the OpenGL support now it doesn't? Anyone got idea where I can find something working?,0.072,0.818,0.11,0.5948,1,1

There are two adjustments which make this ultra-book significantly faster and cooler. I do not recommend repasting its just nonsensical. There are only two basic changes with made significant temp decrease and benchmark increase. Note the X1 Extreme's Core i7-8750H is benchmarking in the top 89% of ALL processors. Which means this X1 Extreme I configured runs faster than nearly 90% of all DELL MAC ETC other systems/configurations with this same processor. Here are result steps below. Cinebench R15 score 1178 up from 966 . Lenovo 20MF000BUS - UserBenchmarks Game 39% Desk 108% Work 79% Full Result Intel Core i7-8750H Nvidia GTX 1050-Ti Mobile Max-Q SSD WDC PC SN720 SDAQNTW-512G-1001 512GB RAM Samsung M471A2K43CB1-CTD 1x16GB Quick context - the i7 8750H is incredibly powerful. To access the full power of SIX cores the system must stay cool. Lenovo's cooling system outperforms Dell and HP in testing and significantly outperforms the Mac Book Pro. So its already just about as fast as you can get in a light thin laptop- but its going to get hot when running all that power. The steps below help keep your processor running at full potential - its a safe and sound no chance of harm. The two-step process must be performed in this order Start by turning off Lenovo intelligent cooling and set the button to performance. Also set your power mode to Best Performance. 1 OPEN MSI Afterburner and RUN OC SCAN This is new tech on latest GPUs. This will automatically run and adjust clock speeds while also undervolting your Nvidia GPU to its max stable state. This will greatly reduce GPU temps and improve framerates. It will also allow your CPU to run faster when both GPU and CPU are under load gaming etc because it will not be drawing as much power away and will generate less heat - leading to NO thermal throttling. Your system is smart it protects itself. NOTE This automatic process will not change the memory speed slider you can do that manually after. Slide it up 450Mhz for safe and sound performance. Save this profile and lets move on. 2 OPEN Intel XTU to safely and securely undervolt. A child could do this. First please forget or ignore all the bloat you may have read posted by extreme tuners which overcomplicate. Forget about throttlestop. Some people are trying to change their processor too much - trust me the uber science nerds at Intel thought of all this already with millions in research and development. I doubt you can balance the needs of your processor better... The ONLY reason we can improve performance here is because we know the one thing that Intel did not know when they made the processor. Intel does not know what laptop their processor is going to end up in. It has to work in a Mac Book or a Dell etc. with different specs and cooling. We do know that this processor is incredibly consistent. Meaning they nearly all undervolt the same way. Totally safe Intel's official XTU app gives you the only settings you need to adjust your i7 to your unique system. Configure your X1 Extreme as follows Open the XTU app and simply slide the slider labeled Core Voltage Offset down to -0.150 V You are done. If you like you can add additional performance safely by also moving the turbo boost power max up to 75.000W for both short and max. Your X1 will not allow you to add too much power. Sliding this up is removing any software handicap - the processor will still limit power per intel specs. Your X1 like your car is monitoring itself and has hard limits which can not be changed by a slider bar duh. Make sure you apply changes close and restart. Open the app on restart and confirm values are set. Expect to see large gains in frames games benchmarks and everyday processing. Anything beyond this is splitting hairs. Would like to conclude with a final word on this system. In my research I have seen post complaining about X1 temp and thermal throttling etc. Some folks report that they retuned the system.. imagine the frustration only to find that ALL ultra-books get hot under load. To be clear - you do not need to change anything about this machine - it is a beast out of box and the temps are outstanding for an ultra book. Its never hot unless gaming and when under load you really can not do better without defying the laws of physics. I sometimes wonder if commenters understand that actual electric is running through system and a lot of it. Touch a 15W light after an hour. Here we have 45 W in a chip the size of your thumb. Fire. Hot. Mac Book Pro if you prefer slow and cool - Lastly kindly note that if you want to watch HD movies in bed then you buy an iPad. This is professional machine with serious power - outperforms pretty much any other laptop on market and most desktops. All best!,0.041,0.82,0.139,0.9984,1,1

See my other post for details I have been researching and finally found the approach to tune the trackpad to a good usable level. It is still no better than Macbook Pro and my last HP Spectre but is much better than what it was. 1. If you have a stock Lenovo Windows 10 installation. You can skip this step. 1. Install Latest trackpad driver from Lenovo Vantage or Lenovo official website. 2. Important ! Go to Microsoft Store install Synaptics Touchpad Control Panel . 2. Go to system settings Touchpad Settings. 1. Limit cursor speed to 7. Personally I use 5. 2. Scroll down there is a Synaptics Touchpad part. Click settings 1. Set sensitivity all the way to the max. In my case it's 57. 2. Set palm check to 4. 3. Disable Edge Region Filtering. 3. As pointed by other redditors this seems to be irreverent. It's might be for the trackpoint Important ! Open Registry Editor 1. Go to HKEY LOCAL MACHINE SOFTWARE Synaptics SynTP Stick 2. There is a TouchThreshold change that value to 0. These steps worked on my T495. It should be applicable on similar models as well. Now you should have a much better trackpad experience ! Let me know if have such issues and if this helps .,0.043,0.811,0.146,0.98,1,1

However that leaves room for some good deals still. I’m tempted by some cheap i5 T470 Thinkpads I can see on eBay but I can’t afford them until next month by which time they may be gone. Otherwise I’ll likely aim for a lower model like a T460. If I go the latter route how much would I be missing out on? Do they have essentially the same keyboard? I keep hearing enormous praise for the T470 keyboard while the T460 one isn’t mentioned. Are they different? I’ll be using it mainly for word processing and maybe some light video editing. Is the T470 that much faster? Would the T460 be really slow? For reference my current piece of junk laptop is a Lenovo G50-70 that I got around 2015.

It started when my Linux install crashed failed at shutting down and I force powered it off. Then I booted into windows to update the TB3 firmware to fix this however that just disappeared and then Windows hung while rebooting so another force power off. I booted into Windows one last time and performed some Windows Updates again it hung while rebooting and I force powered it off. When I tried to boot back into Windows it hung at a black screen after entering the Windows bootloader and even holding the power button would not work. Finally figured out how to turn it off by pressing the emergency reset button on the bottom but now it does not even attempt to boot. The current state is when I power it on the keyboard backlight flashes then it hangs with the power light on and the fan spinning. It doesn't respond to holding the power button so I have to press the emergency reset button to power it off. Because the problem manifests so early and I force powered off after firmware updates I'm worried the firmware may be corrupted. Is there any way to fix this? I did a little bit of research cut short by my T420 overheating due to a dead fan and I saw some people suggest resetting the CMOS. I assume I could due that by disconnecting the battery removing the coin cell and holding the power button. Is this a good thing to try or could it make it worse? My T490 is still covered by warranty would they be able to handle this? Should I try resetting the CMOS before trying warranty?

Using it for two months I literally love the Lenovo spark. Now I’ve made a decision after gathering up money . To finally buy myself a first Lenovo I want to start from the E series. My reasons 1 I’ll be able to learn by customising well the Ram and the ssd etc. That’s pretty much what you change and also the battery which isn’t going to die that quick 2 the T series here Pakistan are basically very expensive for whatever reason. 3 I don’t really care about the display as I’ve read a lot of reviews about Lenovo E series shit display even with FHD. 4 It’s in my budget tbh and I don’t want to buy any other brand. I want to join the lenovo hype gang that’s the most significant part lol Jkjk 5 This laptop will be used for baby level programming and if so University work computer science student . Specs I’ll be buying which is available in my country i7 10th gen 8gb Ram 1Tb HDD ik . . I wanted an SSD but I can upgrade that later which I save up money in 3 months to get a good one FHD display 2Gb AMD graphic card correct me if I wrote it wrong etc rest is history. My Question If you’ve read the specs list then you’ll be asking me why I’m buying a HDD so basically in my country there’s limited Lenovo’s available anyways. And the only I can get my hands on are with an HDD whilst I can later buy an SDD by myself. It sucks used and refurbished laptops here are not trusted because people are scammers most of them tbh. So my question would be that I’ve a very indecisive person • •. Should I go through this purchase? I’ll be placing an order on Monday. Addition potential purchases I’m considering I’ll probs get a Cooling padding it’s on sale as I’ve heard about the average ventilation. Cost Well it’s going to cost me 140K PKR rupees and that’s almost 900USD?? I think. Expensive right? It’s how it is 😭 here. Update I GOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL ON E590. So I went for they it costed me 700 USD Saved 200 bucks which I put into buying the SSD For the same specs without 10th gen afc and minus the Graphic card. So far I’m very happy with the build!! Def does feel like a budget premium laptop. With the money saved I got a good SDD and • • plan to upgrade the ram as well! just for future proofing!!

2,gkw8ap,thinkpad,9,2020/05/17 07:13:46,Morning,Need help buying a Thinkpad I'm a comp sci student looking to buy a new laptop and I heard Thinkpads were pretty good. It's mostly going to be for daily use and anything else I may need to do. The issue I have right now is that there are so many options for Thinkpads that I feel kind of lost. I was wondering if any of you guys could guide me in the right direction or atleast give some recomendations. Price isn't the biggest issue for me but cheaper would be greatly appreciated. It needs to have a good enough battery to last me through the day and it also needs to be sturdy enough to handle my daily abuse I tend to handle my laptops quite roughly . I plan on using this for many years to come and so having it be future proof is a must. I enjoy being able to rip things apart and tinker with them mostly cause I tend to break them a lot and so it'd be nice if that's possible as well. Since I plan on carrying this around with me daily a lighter option would be nice. I heard buying second hand Thinkpads and then replacing them with newer components is a viable option as it can save a good deal of money but I can't seem to find any for super cheap. I don't know if this makes a difference but I also plan on throwing Linux on the device the minute I get it.,0.028,0.798,0.173,0.9905,1,1

There have been many many reports of people having issues with their X1 Carbon Gen 7 batteries. Specifically an error stating Battery not detected and the inability to use the laptop without the charger plugged into the wall. I've seen a few posts on this subreddit about the issue. POSSIBLE SOLUTION This issue has been plaguing me for some time. Recently I encountered a Lenovo forum thread on the topic Apparently this is a really big issue many X1 Carbon owners and firmware updates don't seem to be fixing it. However a few people on the forum reported they found a solution that can be done at home. I will quote it exactly Solution Disable battery in bios 2. Remove back cover 3. Disconnect battery connector from motherboard 4. Reconnect the battery connector Credit to alifamzari on the Lenovo forums for that guide. I did this solution myself last night and so far so good. It wasn't hard at all especially after watching the videos. Granted it's only been a day for me. However other people on the Lenovo forum have reported that this solution has worked for them for a long period of time. No guarantees this will permanently fix the issue but it seems to be working for many people and is an okay alternative to having to send in the laptop for repair. Note please if you do attempt this make sure to follow the directions very carefully especially about first disabling the battery in bios for safety. Hope this helps!,0.035,0.826,0.139,0.9722,1,1

The monitor has two USB ports to which are connected a mouse and a keyboard. When connected through the adapter the display part works without any issues but the usb devices are laggy or almost non-responding at all. Everything is updated in Lenovo Vantage and Windows Update.

But I've caught the thinkpad bug I really love the tactile feel of the keyboard! I'm considering getting an x270 for a few reasons let me explain my preferences needs and reasoning so I could get feedback --I'll primarily be using it for document processing web browsing etc. And after this experience with the 11e I never want to go back to 4gb ram again it shouldn't lag doing simple tasks! -- I prefer smaller screens because bigger screens aggravate my migraines at least when trying to get work done eg my desktop monitor at 20 inches. I've become accustomed to 11.6 inches wonder if I could tolerate 14 inches like the T series but am not sure. I also want it be portable as a student. Thus also need good battery --I'm considering the x270 specifically because it was released for a few reasons 1. I have a sensory processing disorder and can't tolerate the feeling of dust deep in an item hey at the bottom it says see also autism so yeah 2. 2017 seems to the best last year they didn't solder the ram and wanna try to upgrade it because why not. note a friend will be doing it for me I don't see the point in buying a much older x series with a few hundred dollars in upgrades why not get the new one So the cheapest x270's I've come across are 400 on ebay and it generally seems like laptop prices have undergone inflation because covid. I also am considering buying maxed out t490's I've come across for like 800-900 because why not seems worth it for longevity though again not sure about the screen. Do you guys think the x270 would fit me well? What should I go for? Please feel free to guide me and recommend other models. Thanks so much!!,0.064,0.806,0.13,0.9836,1,1

A little background. I'm an Automation/Robotics Engineering Instructor for a local community college. I primarily teach the basics of AC/DC Digital Fundamentals and 3 phase Industrial Motor Control/Power Applications with PLC Troubleshooting thrown in for good measure. My background however and previous specialty was embedded hardware engineering and design. As such I've convinced my college to provide the necessary tooling to do any manner of PCB design assembly and diagnostics. So I can easily handle the necessary desoldering and resoldering of a relatively simple single BGA chip. Even at 1440 pins. My question s is more on the thinkpad/laptop specific side of things. I know it's possible to throw a Coffee Lake CPU into a Skylake Motherboard Z370 to Z170.. etc so in theory it should be possible to do the same with most/any FCBGA1440 CPU with the same TDP. Desktop class motherboards do not equate to laptops and the same hardware modifications required may not be so easily performed or possible on the laptop but that's not my immediate concern. What I am interested in and wondering about is if someone like klem would be able to update the BIOS UEFI microcode to accommodate for the additional CPU. Once my P50 arrives next Friday I will take it apart and see if I can find the same equitable hardware modification locations on the mainboard but I want to play around with the theoretical possibilities until then and create a discourse in the process. Basically I want to provide the same or similar level of upgrade of the 51nb products x210 x62...etc but without the entire re-work of a PCB/Mainboard.

I don't remember how much I paid exactly but with their Cyber Monday sale and the Rakuten cash back I think it came out to around 800- 900. Anyway I cheaped out for that cyber Monday discount and went with 8GB of RAM instead of 16GB. My issue is that the RAM doesn't feel like enough. I'm almost always running an external monitor at 4k and frequently running Discord Firefox VPN sometimes PhotoShop and I'll notice that my ThinkPad will start to crawl bad. I guess my question is is the crawling issue due to RAM or do you think it's just a device that wasn't mean to be put through this kinda usage? I keep beating myself up over not going with 16GB of RAM but maybe that wouldn't have significantly improved my situation anyway. I have a small apartment and I haven't owned a PC since I was a kid using dial-up. I've owned nothing but laptops since then. Maybe it's time to fork up the cash for a small workstation? IDK.. I guess I'm kinda asking for tips in my situation. I'm a graduate student majoring in cyber security so I really should invest in a powerful machine but I am a student so your boy is BROKE so yea lemme know what you think and we'll go from there lol.

On Windows 10 which I hadn’t deleted yet I use Lenovo Vantage in order to monitor the battery life and keep it healthy if I’m on Linux then supposedly it still works even when I’m not one windows since it only says “charging” but doesn’t go down or up this Thinkpad takes a week plus to go down a percent on Windows so it might be the same on Linux. Thing is I tried disabling it one windows turning off the threshold and it didn’t work it would still charge past the threshold even after setting it with TPL. Anyway I can get the battery threshold options working? My district is Manjaro Linux I have TLP installed and I have acpi call installed on Linux itself. still new so I’m trying to set this up and confirm it works since I don’t want a windows partition just for managing battery.,0.028,0.951,0.021,-0.4956,-1,0

However today I applied for government funding because of the virus and it was my intention to purchase a ThinkPad T480s. My dad told me that I wasn't to purchase the T480s because he may or may not have already purchased the T460s. I'm irritated because I communicated with them and told them that I wanted to get the newer model so that the performance would be better and by getting an older model I am going to need to buy a brand new battery from Lenovo to get the computer working like new. I'm thankful that I'm getting a ThinkPad at all but I'm not sure if the T480s is as big of an upgrade as I thought that it would be or if it is no contest a better computer. So now that I'm not buying a laptop for myself should I get a ThinkCentre? It's very difficult to find one that has an HDMI port standard which is essential to me.,0.06,0.886,0.054,-0.2576,-1,0

Pre-covid I mostly worked with the laptop closed and external keyboard/monitor so obviously can't use face unlock that way. But recently working from home I've been working on the laptop with the screen open and it finally dawned on me to give face unlock a try. I've only used it a few times but wow I'm impressed. It's so fast that I didn't even see it log me in the first time I had to logoff and try again to make sure it was actually doing something. It's definitely faster and easier than the fingerprint scanner or typing a password.

I have about 400 total to spend after taxes but in a perfect world I would only like to spend 300. Everywhere I look and search refurbished thinkpad is the answer that I get. The only thing that turns me off about thinkpads is the fact that I would have to buy an older one and will probably not be able to upgrade it myself. For me needs and budget the T440p is what I keep coming to. I am not super thrilled about how bulky it looks but with my limited budget I can get over it. I’m just worried that maybe a thinkpad that is that old that will not be upgraded might not be worth it. My needs are pretty low. At maximum I would have 3 chrome tabs Microsoft word Spotify and a lightweight game opened at the same time. The only game I play is OldSchool Runescape which is a browser-based game from 2007 so pretty low requirements.,0.126,0.773,0.101,0.0188,0,0

2,gkng3b,thinkpad,5,2020/05/16 19:07:48,Evening,What causes a battery to stop charging? Is it repairable? I had a T61P for over a decade without any battery issues. It had a few other issues due to wear so I replaced it with a cheap refurbished T430S in 2018. The battery on the refurbished was first used in 2013 but the max capacity was something like 95% of the original. Two years later the max capacity is 65% and it lasted quite a while off the charger. I don't take it off of a/c very often and when I do it is usually only for 30mins. Last night I had the laptop off of a/c and got the battery down to 5% remaining charge. I plugged it in and the battery charges to 70% and stops. I open up the Lenovo power manager and see a message battery failed due to normal wear cannot charge replace it . I am a little shocked but not really because so far the T430S has been a piece of shit quality wise compared to my T61P - how does a 70% capacity battery stop charging / fail? I haven't taken a multimeter to the laptop or battery to see what is at fault. I assume it is the battery and not the charging circuit. I don't want to buy a new battery since I rarely use it off a/c. So as per title can a failed battery be repaired?,0.145,0.812,0.043,-0.9747,-1,0

The monitor works when I connect my Nintendo Switch Xbox and iPad to it. To connect the iPad to the monitor I’m using the same usb-c to hdmi cable that I’m using with the surface book 2 so the cable itself doesn’t seem to be the issue. I can also connect the surface to other monitors and TVs using the same cable with no problems. That makes it seem like the computer itself isn’t the problem either. My Surface “sees” the monitor as it’s available in the settings and such. It only seems like the monitor is not picking up the signal from the laptop. I’ve ordered a usb-c to DisplayPort adapter that will be arriving tomorrow and see if that changes anything. Until now however I’m lost trying to figure out the problem.

It started out reasonably fast a few seconds and has gotten slower and slower. Specs of computer Acer Swift 1 SF114-32 laptop with 4GB memory 64 GB internal flash storage added 128 GB SD card for files. Internal flash storage has 15% free space left. Pentium Silver N5000.

I've tried the following and none have helped 1. Turning off and on fast boot in BIOS 2. Turning off and on fast startup in Windows 3. Updating BIOS from 1.03 to 1.12 latest 4. Disabling Windows 10 startup items 5. Disabling unessential Windows 10 services 6. Defragging the SSD flash drive I usually don't defrag since it's a SSD flash drive 7.

2,gl3fix,AcerOfficial,8,2020/05/17 14:10:02,Afternoon,So I'm getting really slow speeds over WIFI 5GHz on my Acer Predator Triton 500 Brand new laptop.......and I pay for reasonably fast fibre broadband 350mbps up/40mbps down . I always get these speeds easily via ethernet. Even over WIFI on my iPhone iPad and MacBook I get around 220-250mbps down/40mbps up. When it comes to my new Acer Predator Triton 500 which cost me 1 599.98 however I'm only getting 22.95mbps down/9.45mbps up. That's absolutely pathetic in anyone's book. Can someone please help me here - this surely can't be right? I'm loving everything else about this laptop......but surely in 2020 this shouldn't be a problem with a gaming laptop no less .

I know this is a bit of a lame post but you never know the power of the community! I have an Acer Aspire V17 Nitro Black Edition VN7-792G that's five years old now but was going on strong. The only thing that was wrong with it was I was running out of storage and so thought I'd take the opportunity to upgrade the RAM as well as the SSD and HDD. I was able to dismantle the laptop and replace all of these components but found after reassembling it that it would not boot. The laptop would power on but it wouldn't even enter BIOS and all I could do was switch it off by holding the power button down. I put the original components back in the laptop and was able to boot it once. I don't know what I did that was different on that occasion to all other times I've tried but apart from that one instance I haven't been able to boot it again. Same problem - black screen no BIOS. The laptop beeps when I plug and unplug the charger but that's it. I know there's not much to go on here but I am posting in the hope that maybe someone has some useful experience they can impart on me. Maybe there's something simple I've forgotten to do that someone else found out the hard way? Fingers crossed!,0.058,0.857,0.085,0.8733,1,1

1,gj7ds2,AcerOfficial,4,2020/05/14 12:45:50,Morning,Need help with my new Acer Predator Triton 500 and Oculus link VR....I'm having a nightmare!! So....My new laptop is the Acer Predator Triton 500 specs are 16gb Ram CPU i7 9750H GPU RTX 2060 with 6gb vRam 2x 512GB NVMe SSD I did a lot of research before I bought this and it has glowing reviews across the board and should be definitely VR capable. I have the Anker cable that Oculus recommends for Oculus Link. So I set it up and got the green tick of approval....All good so far. But then I just got the dreaded 3 dots in my headset - for ages I couldn't figure out what to do. Eventually I disabled the Intel graphics card thus forcing the RTX 2060 GPU to became the default. I still had the same issues 3 dots . I then went into the power settings of my USB's and unticked the power saving on each of them. Bingo!! That worked......no more 3 dots and I'm in the Oculus Rift home! Hurrah!!! I'd like to say that's where my tale ends but alas I must continue with my story of woe.... I download Robo Recall I had been playing this over Virtual Desktop using Shadow PC's service fine but I was looking forward to finally being able to play this lag free or near as damn it because link cable trumps VD in that department right? . As soon as it loads to the title screen I know something is terribly wrong major black bars when I move my head - this can't be right? I didn't even have this when I used Shadow PC over VD . So basically it's unplayable. I then download Steam VR and Google Earth VR. I am in the Steam VR Home....all fine and dandy. I click on Google Earth and I'm taken to that bit where you wait while it loads........except it doesn't load it just boots me straight back to Steam VR Home!!! I keep trying...same thing! WTF!!! Ok maybe - just maybe - it's the cable it's still in beta after all right? . So I download the Virtual Desktop streamer put my Oculus nickname in.....and open up the side loaded version of Virtual Desktop in my Quest like how I always used to do when subscribed to Shadow . It finds my Acer laptop instantly and connects immediately...........wow things are looking up. Maybe I can resign myself to using Virtual Desktop for my PC gaming. I fire up Robo Recall again......but to my absolute horror I'm getting those major black bars again when I move my head!! So that rules out the issue being with the Oculus Link. Guys I don't know what to do......surely my laptop is powerful enough to run VR ok? Surely! I haven't had a Windows pc for years and years having got a Macbook so I'm a bit rusty on the operating system. Is there something blindingly obvious I should have done? Any step I missed?

Like the MX250 wouldnt be soldered onto the motherboard right since it's a dedicated card?,0.039,0.722,0.239,0.9502,1,1

1,gicjll,AcerOfficial,0,2020/05/13 06:45:17,Night,Quick question regarding the Acer Predator Triton 500 RTX 2060 I’ve ordered.... Does this laptop support 4K HDR? Not on the laptop’s screen itself obviously but when hooked up to a TV via HDMI seeing as it has an HDMI 2.0 out port . I have a Sony 49XF9005 4K HDR/Dolby Vision TV with 4 x 2.0 HDMI ports. If so I might sell my XBox One X and PS4 Pro and use this laptop as my main lounge gaming device paired with an Xbox controller . I’ve already ordered this laptop now so it’s not a dealbreaker...... but it would be super cool to play 4K HDR games from the laptop on my TV 🙂,0.0,0.864,0.136,0.9408,1,1

I've had it for about a year and a half and it was working perfectly fine until now. When I've got the laptop at full charge and plugged in it keeps constantly beeping as if I removed the charger even though it's plugged in. This is very irritating as the laptop slows down and lags when ever this happens. Basically the problem is that the laptop keeps either charging or not charging even when the original charger is plugged in. Is there a way to fix this? thanks.,0.078,0.815,0.107,0.4909,1,1

5,ggv0c6,AcerOfficial,7,2020/05/10 20:41:32,Evening,Helios 300 2019 Kingston NVME SSD wiped itself out. So I got this laptop last summer and use it for occasional gaming. About 2 months ago I did a clean install of windows without all the bloatware. I made a backup of the drive before the clean install but never got around to doing a backup after a clean install. I was playing a game and paused it for a bit while I was checking some stuff on my other computer. The laptop beeps and gets a BSOD with a critical process died error. It then reboots and I get the no bootable media found error. Drive still shows up in the bios. I boot off a usb partition utility and it shows up as unallocated. Nothing important was on it just windows and steam. My steam library is in the secondary sata ssd I had installed. Out of curiosity I tried using partition recovery and data recovery software and even scanning all sectors on the drive it's basically completely empty. I'll lose time reinstalling windows/drivers and steam however I've never had this happen or know anyone who's had this happen to them. I'm a bit dissapointed as I assume the nvme kingston drive that came with the laptop is faulty. x200B Hopefully install goes ok I'll check smart data to see if anything comes up. Has anyone heard of this happening or had this happen to them? Kinda weird the drive would be completely wiped. Edit Looks like drive is dead windows installer says it can't install to it giving error 0x80300002. If I try to format drive manually it gives error 0x97b65de0. I'll have to look into the warranty.,0.158,0.759,0.083,-0.9789,-1,0

Could this be a loose connection somewhere or is this a panel damage ? Already tested the cables and gpus and it's definitely something with the monitor itself.

With my gaming PC I never heard any fan noise coming from the monitor but thought it might be because my PC’s fan noise which isn’t very loud was drowning out any fan noise coming from the monitor. Today was the first day I’m using the monitor with my work laptop and for a brief second the monitor’s video cut out. I felt under the monitor to make sure the connections were good and they were. But I also felt it was quite warm where the monitor connections were. And so far I have not heard any fan noise coming from the monitor and my laptop is dead silent. I’m wondering if the fans are even coming on at all. Has anyone else experienced this and should I be concerned?,0.053,0.833,0.113,0.8587,1,1

I have a wired keyboard running through the monitor to the laptop which works fine and led me to believe it was just a driver issue. I downloaded the specific one from Acer for my monitor installed it and restarted my laptop but this doesn't seem to have worked either. Sometimes at random points the monitor will connect and work as should but once i unplug my laptop and plug it back in it goes straight back to not working.

3,gcj2md,AcerOfficial,7,2020/05/03 18:38:49,Afternoon,So My Predator 15 Just Died After Almost 4 Years. As the titles states my predator 15 just died out of the blue. I have not overclocked nor altered any system/hardware settings. I was playing Metro Exodus when right before shooting at a mutant the game froze and did not respond to alt f4 nor could I alt tab forcing me to hold down the power button. However I then let go of it and thought I'd try alt f4 one last time since I hate forcing the shutdown. Nevertheless a few seconds later the computer did manage to shutdown but at the same time even the led indicating that the battery is charging was not lighting up. I also realized that I could not charge my phone using the USB which allows charging even when the laptop is powered off this makes me assume that something happened to the motherboard. Is there anyone here that can maybe help me out? It's really frustrating as I've taken really good care of this laptop and I got it for my studies abroad and of course to game. I have a course starting soon for the summer and then a semester in autumn. This laptop was not supposed to die on me this way it is too soon and even if it for whatever reason was it's time to expire it should have done it when I'm done my studies. So any help would be much appreciated or ideas. I've hit the battery reset I've made sure the switch near the m2 slots are pressed used tape . I've tried to power cycle unplug and hold the power button . I believe I've done everything that can be done. I haven't got tools to dig deeper though nor do I believe I could fix it if the problem is the motherboard. Kind regards Dave,0.045,0.851,0.103,0.968,1,1

When I try to flash the official BIOS PO3-A3 over SPI it doesn't match the chipsize 4MB chip 2MB .rom . The version written on the board itself is PO3-A2 but the only rom I find with that name is from an Aspire Z3770 but it does get closer to the needed size which makes me think it misses a sector in the beginning as flashrom also gave out Expected 0xff Found 0x9c and Expected 0xff Found 0x00 in different places and because the BIOS from the Aspire is a bit over 3MB. If it helps the chip is a Winbond W25Q32.V My question now is does anyone have a full eeprom dump or maybe something to nudge me into the right direction?

Basic booting from ssd gives all the factory-installed stuff with working drivers and all that including wifi . Force booting the hdd where i have a diff win10 installed through BIOS at first required some auto setup but everything seemed functional ms office matlab some softwares games save for the lack of working wifi touchpad and ethernet and misc graphic drivers I dont care for yet . At first I thought I could just install drivers from the Acer page and be good to go. But I cannot run either of the proposed wifi drivers on their download page intel and killer because both of them lacked a simple exe launcher of some sort. I even tried a few wifi drivers from intel's site but the exe just refused to run?? Installing random files i had lying around worked just fine but this driver just wont. Im considering downloading a generic qualcomm wifi driver but im not sure which version would even work. What's weird is that the preinstalled ssd is working flawlessly for wifi. So i thought that maybe theres some weird permissions setup I hadnt looked at in the BIOS but that seems implausible. I cant exactly check that now myself since im running a full backup before I try anything else.,0.106,0.83,0.064,-0.9117,-1,0
3,g8rlyh,AcerOfficial,0,2020/04/27 18:10:46,Afternoon,Nitro 5 AN515-54 Windows ClearType ignores settings on secondary monitor Posting this here because I'm wondering if among other things it could be some laptop-specific issue but I could be wrong. I have an Acer Nitro 5 model AN515-54 and I'm trying to use it with an external monitor and the laptop screen serving to extend the display. The monitor and the laptop display have the same native resolution 1920x1080 refresh rate 60Hz and colour settings RGB . I'm using the Windows-recommended scaling for each 125% for the laptop screen 100% for the monitor . The setup mostly works well except for problems with ClearType. Whichever display I've set as the main one determines the ClearType settings for both. In other words the appearance of text on the secondary display changes as I calibrate ClearType for the primary one but does not respond when I calibrate the monitor on which it's actually displayed. ClearType settings for the main display whether it's the laptop screen or the external monitor are applied across the board. As you can imagine this is frustrating as the displays use different values for scaling - it means I have to pick one of my monitors to be the blurry one . Strangely enough no other calibration settings are affected - for instance I can independently control the colour balance of each. I've also verified that it has nothing to do with the external display itself the problem persisted with a different monitor the scaling setting the laptop to 100% for consistency with the external monitor didn't help or any drivers problem persisted before and after updating drivers for all monitors as well as the Intel UHD and NVIDIA GeForce cards . This may be a problem in Windows itself but I also wonder if it has something to do with the GPU's. The laptop display is connected to the internal Intel GPU but the HDMI port is connected to the discrete NVIDIA card. When I click Identify displays in the NVIDIA Control Panel the number 1 appears on both monitors although Windows itself correctly identifies them separately . Also the laptop display disappears from the PhysX configuration when I plug in the external monitor. I'm wondering if the GeForce is somehow treating them as parts of the same display and if this behaviour is somehow influencing that of ClearType? Any help is greatly appreciated - I've been Googling like crazy and haven't found anything about this specific issue beyond re-installing the drivers . For reference I am using Version 1809 of Windows 10 and the NVIDIA card is the GeForce GTX 1050.,0.098,0.857,0.045,-0.973,-1,0

Well the unthinkable happened last Saturday my son tripped over the cord while it was plugged in and the cord and brick flew to the carpet. Plugged the cord back in and no blue charging light no worries I'm sure it just needs a new port. Found an aftermarket on Prime and had it 2 days and installed today. Still no dice. For the record this is a plug and play cord that doesn't need to be soldered. I have posted the difference between the two. My next stop is to check the voltage of the charger when I find my voltmeter. Am I missing something here? Should I try and track down an OEM port?

9,g3iv0c,AcerOfficial,3,2020/04/18 22:20:48,Evening,Acer Nitro V - how to increase and stabilize gaming performance TL DR below I've been messing with my VN7-593G i7-7700 GTX 1060 for around 1.5 years now and thought I'd share everything I found actually substantially increases gaming performance since out-of-the-box it's kind of a mess sometimes. Just a warning - we're going off-warranty with some of these steps and if you don't know what you're doing you could harm your system so proceed with caution at your own risk and always check other tutorials for the specific steps. First up - when it's running at full speed the machine is actually quite the beast for its small price tag. Sadly it almost never gets to run at full speed. I've had various issues here sometimes the GPU clock and voltage were just generally lower than they should be sometimes it would drop from 1600MHz to 130 ! for 1-2 seconds every 10 seconds. I'm not sure exactly what the dynamic is here but my guess is that since CPU and GPU share the same cooling bridge in this model and also have a combined overall Power Limit when one of the components overheats the system drops the TDP Max which causes everything to slow down. Also maybe a side note some steps here actually decrease performance but do so in order to keep it stable. I'm talking about good gaming experience here specifically with regards to VR. I'd rather have a stable 90fps on medium settings then getting motion sickness every 10 seconds at high settings. Anyway here's what I've done The obvious stuff 1. Get a cooling pad. Might sound stupid but it actually saves some 5 C which can be the difference for the system not to pull the performance kill-switch. Totally worth the 10 bucks. 2. Clean and de-dust your fans. They look filthy anyway. Just do it. The trickier stuff 3 Get a good thermal paste open up your laptop clean the old one off the CPU and GPU and reapply. Not gonna go into detail here there's plenty of tutorials for that on yt. Just note if you're afraid of disconnecting any wires on your mainboard you can lift the cooling bridge halfway up without doing that if you prop it up somehow you can still go to work like this. 4 Undervolt your CPU. This was probably still the most drastic change for me but your results may vary since how far you can go with the undervolt always depends on the specific CPU you got. I got a stable undervolt at -0.125V and that alone nets me a 15-20 C saving. Get Intel extreme tuning utility for undervolting and please also read a guide on how to do it before. The weird tweaks 5 Undervolt your GPU. Since GPU voltage is generally locked on laptops you have to use a workaround here. I used MSI Afterburner for the GPU tweaks. It has a voltage/frequency curve editor where you can tell the GPU which voltage to apply to reach which frequency. What I've done is flattened the curve no pun intended to tell the system that it's not even worth going above a specific voltage because it won't get any extra clock speeds from doing so. End result should look something like this Yes this will cut your max performance by around 400MHz. BUT it will be able to hold that performance under almost any load making your FPS more stable than on most systems and especially removing those nasty drops to 5fps. 6 Decrease your CPU max performance. Yes we're going there. Go to Windows power management settings and create new power plan probably based off of the High Performance preset. Then go into advanced settings and change the maximum CPU power state to 60-80% - something like this sorry for the german Only and I mean Only use this profile when playing GPU-heavy games eg most VR games . It drops your max CPU clock to 2.2Ghz which is still enough for most games but it allows the GPU to constantly run on full whack no matter what the workload. If you're doing anything else switch to your regular profile. I know all of this is not a perfect solution but at that laptop's price-to-performance ratio I'm fine with having some extra steps. Just sad I had to figure all of that out on my own but hopefully it helps some of you guys. GLHF! x200B So TL DR Get a cooling pad shut up do it clean your fans. Get good thermal paste open up your laptop and apply on CPU and GPU follow a video tutorial pls Undervolt CPU as far as stable with Intel XTU also follow tutorial Get MSI Afterburner or similar modify voltage/frequency curve to something like this Forces GPU to run on pretty low voltage bit lower performance but consistent. Create a custom Windows power plan reduce max CPU performance to 70%. Less CPU power more GPU power no more fps drops. ONLY use when playing GPU heavy games otherwise switch back to default.,0.064,0.824,0.113,0.9926,1,1

Now let's get on to the problem. So I own an Acer Nitro 5 Ryzen laptop for around a year now. Everything's been great with it for the most part until recently. At first it started with a weird popping/cracking noise when I lifted my laptop to use it. It only happens when I first open it apart from that it never happens again throughout the rest of the day. That went on for a few days. Then jump cut to literally today and it seems like the right side of my laptop screen slightly splits apart whenever I try to open the flap. Oddly enough there's absolutely no damage to my laptop in terms of the way it runs. It's just that the screen splits. But from how it is right now it seems that I can pop it back in and it locks...? I don't know though it looks a little worrying to me. Here's how it looks like I just wanted to know what should I do bout this? Should I try to open up the hinge and lube it up? Is it gonna be alright if I just let it be until I can get a professional to fix it? Should I just leave the flap open until I can actually get it fixed? Please lemme know guys. I'd get it fixed right now but malls around my area are all closed until May cause of a certain pandemic. Thanks again in advance everybody.,0.048,0.858,0.094,0.9156,1,1

I've reinstalled Windows multiple times which didn't fix any of the issues I'm having. I don't expect laptops to have such a short lifespan but lemme list some issues I have with mine. Bluetooth completely disappearing from Windows when using for example wireless headphones. Reinstalling BT drivers doesn't help restarting doesn't help the only way to get this fixed is to wait for a few hours. Audio completely going out randomly. I'm listening to something talking to someone on Discord for example and all of a sudden the whole sound goes out with the sound icon in the taskbar having a red cross over it. Enabling it doesn't work again having to wait although much shorter usually a few seconds . One of the most annoying things about this - what seems like packet loss goes up to 100% every few minutes and I can't do anything. Games cut out Discord voice cuts out after a while searching anything on the internet just brings me to a No internet page. Again this didn't get fixed after reinstalling Windows. Artifacts. I'm not sure if the dedicated GPU GTX 1050 Ti is dying or if I'm doing something seriously wrong. I tried reinstalling drivers downgrading drivers updating to the newest drivers anything but nothing helped. Every program that runs on my dedicated GPU has artifacts in a while of using be it League of Legends Photoshop Premiere Pro etc. Got a screenshot of this in both League's launcher and Photoshop included in the imgur link below.

I have a laptop Acer Aspire 5750G owned by me since 2011. I was trying to solve an overheating issue and some people over the internet suggested updating the BIOS to the newest version in order to achieve more efficient fan usage. I surfed the Acer Official Site and I noticed that the choices that are given regarding my specific laptop model for the relevant downloadable files drivers bios updates etc are only destined for WIndows 7 32/64 and Windows 8 32/64 OS. However since some years now I run Windows 10 on my laptop as a result of the free Win 7 to Win 10 update Microsoft offered. The question is is it safe to download and install the latest BIOS version destined for a previous Win OS on my Win10 system and if not how can I update my BIOS? I would like to hope that I don't have to get stuck to the current BIOS version V.1.07 . Thank you in advance for the assistance fellow redditors and tech geeks.

5,fx7dkd,AcerOfficial,0,2020/04/09 06:25:25,Night,Confusion VG271 I currently have the Acer Nitro VG271 P pbmiipx or whatever . My product is a little confusing since most sites state that this monitor only displays up to 1080x1920 yet my monitor is able to display 1440x2560 as if I had the the VG271 U WQHD version . However I know I don't have the the U version since the model number on the back of my monitor matches with that of the VG271 P. I've heard there's a VG271 UP which might be an in between but on newegg this monitor has a blue stand unlike the red found on the other two. The monitor is alright but has noticeable edge glow and artifacts overshooting if not properly calibrated. The version that I have right now is also very dim making it hard to use the VRB extreme feature when playing FPS games. There is very low input lag and response times but the monitor looks a little washed out no matter what color settings you use. I'm not saying it's a bad monitor I'm just saying it's not for me. Once again according to the model on the back of my monitor UM.HV1AA.P02 I have the VG271 pbmiipx version This monitor has a max resolution of 1080x1920 but my monitor runs 1440p just fine. Do you think I got the wrong monitor? I don't have the boxes but I still have all the accesories. I got the monitor from amazon. I think the warranty was 3 year so Im pretty sure Im still in warranty period however I don't think this is applicable for return/refund. Do I need the box and original packaging? I've had this monitor for a while now and I'm just realizing I may have the wrong model or something else is wrong with the monitor. Please help.,0.082,0.814,0.104,0.7145,1,1
4,fx6k8q,AcerOfficial,14,2020/04/09 05:34:21,Night,If you have a gaming model like Helios 300 you'll likely want to be using PredatorSense to control fan speeds TLDR On my Helios 300 fan speeds don't and likely never ramped up to max automatically. Manually maxing the fans gives a 5-15C temperature difference when gaming. Back when I got my Helios 300 I figured the fans would automatically do a good enough job at ramping up when needed and that all would be fine. Regular gaming sessions would leave my CPU around 80-90C at times and GPU up to 75-80C with a laptop cooler repaste with IC Diamond 7 and clean internal fans. Eventually after about 4 months the NVIDIA GPU ended up having a hardware failure after an extended gaming session thread and I had to send the laptop in for repairs. I'm not trying to have that happen again so then I looked into PredatorSense for fan control in order to see if it'd help at all. I turn ColdBoost on and leave it on at all times. When gaming I set the fan speed to Max and set the GPU overclock to Turbo. When not gaming I put the fan speed back to Auto but keep the GPU overclock and ColdBoost enabled. With the fan speed at max my CPU and GPU temps don't go past 75C so about a 5C improvement on the GPU and 5-15C improvement for the CPU. I've never heard my laptop's fan as loudly as when I select Max so I'm wondering if it ever ramped up to max fan speeds. This is only seemingly applicable to Windows. I've primarily used and gamed on Linux prior to this but I haven't found a way to control fans or even monitor them there's no PWM control detected for fancontrol fans don't show up in lm sensors even with scanning all sensors it's possible NoteBook Fan Control could be made to work but no idea . When I unlocked my BIOS on this laptop previously there were fan speed control settings and values shown something like fan speed 75 at 55C . I haven't experimented with them and also lost the BIOS unlock when I had the laptop repaired. If these fan settings work it'd theoretically get rid of dependence on PredatorSense and just work on any OS I'd just max the fan speed starting around 50-60C general usage has me at 30-40C on CPU .,0.031,0.829,0.14,0.9907,1,1

Well I am a student as a study at a public institute I was the beneficiary of a program that provides PCs to students. x200B To me they gave me the Acer Swift 1 which came in perfect condition the problem is that after about 1 year of slightly careless use not gonna lie. My right USB stopped working. It does not give current it does not transfer data ... Nothing I checked this with my cellphone which did not charge with a mouse which has some decorative lights which did not turn on and the mouse did not work either. It should be noted that the other 2 USB do work . x200B With the help of my dad we opened the PC since he works with that stuff but he told me that he did not find anything wrong with the USB we tried to use compressed air to remove the dirt from the cables but nothing. x200B I know that the warranty no longer covers because I opened the PC but what if it's a software problem? In that case I need a solution. x200B Thank you! x200B SF113-31-P3ES,0.083,0.821,0.096,0.5465,1,1

It's grayed out. I put in a Supervisors password and that allowed a few more things to be changed but no luck on the boot mode. Any ideas? Edit It looks like I could have spent 40 and upgraded Acronis again. But on a lark I tried Macrium Reflect Free. My brother's been using it for a while. I never tried it because you usually go with what you know. The learning curve was about an hour. I used Windows PE 10.0 to make a rescue USB that supports UEFI and didn't have to change anything in the bios. Boom. It was 10 minutes to make the image and 10 minutes to load it on the 2nd machine.

After booting it runs fairly slow a simple task like opening Chrome or Chromium can take about 30s! I ran the fsc /scannow command chckdisk /f/r I also used the Disk Cleanup and Disk Defragment tools. These steps have helped with the speed of my laptop but it's still slow so now I am considering adding some RAM to solve the problem. Since my laptop only has one ram slot I think my best bet would be to replace my stock 2 GB DDR3L Memory with a Crucial 8GB DDR3L-1866 SODIMM Any helpful comments/ideas/opinions would be greatly appreciated!,0.027,0.818,0.155,0.9495,1,1
2,fsgupn,AcerOfficial,4,2020/04/01 09:12:35,Morning,My Aspire 7 Keeps Locking Up Inputs When I type or play a game randomly my inputs will not be registered for a few seconds but after a little while it registers all the inputs very quickly. For example while typing I may not be able to see what I'm typing for about 10-20 seconds but when it stops being locked up it will place the text I typed in the correct order. The whole computer doesn't freeze since when it happens videos will still play and games will still run. It is most annoying in video games when it locks my input to the last button I pressed for that time causing me to fall off of maps and things. It also messes with my mouse which freezes and unfreezes over and over causing my aim in game to fly around everywhere. I don't know what's causing it since it happens both when I'm running an intensive game and when I run just notepad. I haven't found anyone mentioning anything similar online but I may not have searched the correct keywords . Does anyone have any ideas on what could fix this?

Some games will 'take control' of the monitor in a sense that when opened the screen goes black for a second as if it's turning off and will then turn on and show that the display port is being used in the top right-hand corner. If I alt-tab to get to discord or chrome it will do the same thing and will sometimes distort my entire screen. So far it has happened with Minecraft and Nier Automata and the only way to fix it has been by reinstalling the game and restarting the monitor Problem 2 is a stuck pixel. Tried multiple methods to try and get rid of it but it's real stuck which is very distracting If anyone knows how to fix these issues especially the first one I'd be very happy cause I like this monitor a lot and with Corona I'm not in a spot where I can go and get a replacement for at least a month.

I think the problem is the hard drive but I'm unsure and wondering if anyone has come across the problem before. The laptop never gets past the initial Acer screen during its boot-up. When I connect the drive to another machine it shows the disk partitions however when I try to enter them it then crashes windows explorer and the device is no longer visible. I tried the windows disk format to try and wipe the drive however it also crashed when trying to perform this action. This occurs every time I try both options. I cannot enter the boot menu or bios when I load up the laptop either. Anybody any advice on how to fix this or how to format the hard drive to start again if this is the case I will need to find my windows key for the device any help on that would be appreciated too as I no longer have the box .,0.103,0.855,0.042,-0.7469,-1,0

2,fqi7vs,AcerOfficial,14,2020/03/29 03:11:39,Night,Helios 300 higher FPS on external display I have an Acer Helios 300 2019 version with a gtx 1660ti. My fps for most games were a bit lower than other benchmarks on youtube. On gta5 I was getting about 15% lower than others so I didnt think much about it. But on rainbow six siege I am getting much lower FPS. While others got 144fps on ultra settings I'm getting just 100 fps on low graphic settings. Even in other games like Assassins Creed Unity my fps is about 30% lower than others. When I connected to an external display through the HDMI port I got the same FPS that other benchmarks on youtube got. But on the laptop display the FPS is about half on rainbow six siege. Here is my video with gameplay on external display and laptop display. on laptop display external display I have reinstalled windows and don't have any unnecessary junk except MSI afterburner and steam. I took the recording on the external display and right after that on the laptop display too. There are no other variables other than the addition of the external display. From what I understand the HDMI port is directly connected to the Nvidia GPU but the laptop display is connected to the intel GPU. So while gaming on the laptop display the Nvidia GPU has to send frames through the Intel GPU. However benchmarks with my exact same config are getting 170 FPS on the laptop display itself.

Even though the laptop ships with 8GB of RAM confirmed in the BIOS only 3.2 are usable within Windows. That is less than half and makes quite a difference in performance. In all likelyhood this is related to the onboard GPU Radeon R6 which is sharing some of the built in memory. However since this device has a dedicated graphics card with dedicated memory I don't really have a need for the onboard one. Now normally this would be something to change on the advanced tab in BIOS. I've done so many times on a number of devices. However for this model the advanced tab of BIOS appears to be be something of a myth. Half the people swear it exists other say it doesn't. If there is indeed no advanced BIOS how can I tell the system to not allocate any memory to the onboard graphics card? Thanks for any advice!,0.019,0.871,0.11,0.9312,1,1

Even in other games like Assassins Creed Unity my fps is about 30% lower than others. Also recently I started getting fps stuttering while playing and these are the results using MSI afterburner As you can see whenever there is a FPS drop/stutter the intel gpu usage increases and nvidia gpu usage decreases. I have done a DDU and updated both nvidia and intel display drivers but I still have this problem. I have seleced High Performance Nvidia Processor in Nvidia settings too but still the issue persists. I think it might be an issue of nvidia optimus but I have tried fixing it by selecting nvidia gpu in the nvidia settings and fps is still low. What else can I do to fix this issue? Edit1 I think its something to do with nvidia optimus. I used an external monitor which is directly connected to the GPU and I had no stuttering and also had better FPS. From what I understand the laptop display is connected to the intel GPU and the nvidia GPU has to send frames through the intel one. I think there is some problem here as using the nvidia GPU connected directly to the external display has better performance than the laptop display connected to the Intel GPU. I have enabled the nvidia gpu as the preferred GPU in the nvidia control panel. Update I have reinstalled windows and cleaned the fans today but the FPS is still the same.

I've been facing an issue since the last month where the laptop gets stuck the glitch lines start populating the screen at like 3-4 green and sometimes RGB lines/patches per second the PC doesn't shut down but it isn't usable. Media - 1. 2. Here are the things that I tested and noted- Conditions normal room temperature elevated laptop with mesh bottom for airflow 100% battery life and the laptop kept on a fixed stable spot 1. After connecting it to another display using an HDMI cable when it suddenly happened the screen on the second display got stuck at its last state with the laptop's display getting populated with that glitch at the same time. At this point the keyboard lights are on the PC doesn't crash and just keep showing that matrix like screen slowing down its process of populating itself with green lines. 2. I tried the same with my power cable disconnected but it still occurred again. 3. I opened up my laptop and checked all the connections there seemed to be no issue but I tightened them again and ran the same tests but the issues persisted. This is my personal as well as my work laptop I'd really appreciate the communities help thank you 3.

5,fms9kh,AcerOfficial,5,2020/03/22 18:31:09,Afternoon,Bought an Acer Nitro 5. Very disappointed. This thing has been nothing but issues. At 1st it was wonderful but after 2 or 3 weeks the CPU fan started groaning and not reaching proper RPMs then the CPU fan stopped working most of the time with very rare instances where it would start groaning again. Next came the keyboard...half of it stopped working. Luckily the power button still worked however. Then the mouse pad stopped working and when the laptop would start up I'd get a picture of a hand pointing at a touch pad with a cancel sign. And then today I close my laptop lid take a nap and when I wake up the power button no longer works rendering the entire laptop unworkable. I would have sent it in earlier and had talked to support but they had quoted me a 4 week turn around time which interferes with University but now with this world situation I now begrudgingly have time to send it in...though I still use my laptop as everything from my tv to my gaming console.,0.084,0.796,0.119,0.896,1,1

I disabled the monitor's Overdrive and the problem persisted then finally I disabled Freesync on the Nvidia panel and guess what? at the time it stopped flashing the screen ... is the problem using Freesync?

1,flwt98,AcerOfficial,4,2020/03/21 07:24:33,Morning,Acer Nitro 5 keeps disconnecting from WIFI Hey everyone I’ve been having problems with my Acer Nitro 5 AN515-53-52FA that I had for about 3 years. Recently I’ve been using ethernet for about half a year already because Ive had a wifi problem since around a year ago. I recently had to move to a different place in my house for gaming so I decided to move back to wifi while being naive about my wifi problem. After researching on my wireless card which is an Intel Wireless AC 9560 Ive had no matching results to my wifi problem. The wifi problem is that whenever I connect to wifi it will disconnect for a split second anytime it wants and reconnect. It doesn’t show that it disconnects and shows that it was on wifi the whole time. This makes gaming a serious problem for me since I will usually get kicked for disconnecting even when it shows it have not. I’ve looked into device manager to disable the save power mode to no smps. Back in 2018 when this laptop was new I had no issues whatsoever so I was think it might have to do with an update because I kept this laptop in ‘like-new’ condition. I’ve done almost everything I could other than it being a hardware issue. It seems like everyone has the Qualcomm Atheros wireless card driver instead because their Nitro 5 is a different variant. Going back to the update issue I’m not totally sure if windows updates has to do with this since windows does funky stuff to your computer and driver sometimes and that I didn’t keep track if this problem persisted after an update. But anyway I can’t connect to ethernet which is a big downside and i cant connect to a stable wifi connection which is just a terrible experience overall. I also won’t be taking this laptop back for repairs if needed as I don’t have the time nor money. But anyway please help if you can and thank you.,0.116,0.846,0.039,-0.9651,-1,0

I have Acer 5750G and before doing a clean reinstall from a CD not the Acer backup recovery CDs I made but a pure Win 7 64-bit CD I had two recovery partitions that came with the laptop - a 17GB partition labelled OEM or Acer Recovery I'm not sure and 100MB PQService. Backstory The PQService partition had been formatted before doing the reinstall because an IT professional said it might conflict after doing a clean reinstall because it might be there twice aftwer it although I was doubtful since it worked fine when I tried it before and said that it's not related to the Acer recovery partition when I said what if it's needed so he formatted it. Everything seemed fine but after doing the reinstall I found out that all the Acer recovery functions don't work. The issue When I boot into the recovery menu I only get the regular Win 7 recovery menu and not the Acer one and I can't even install the recovery app from the application backup CD if it's there because it doesn't load - it just keeps spinning in the drive and I see the CD in the file manager but can't open it. I still have my 4 backup Acer CDs so I could try booting them and doing another reinstall however I'd prefer if it I could somehow restore the partition if it's still there using some software retrieval or reinstalling somehow. Is it possible? Is there a way to recover the PQService partition since I tried not using the laptop much? Or a way to reinstall it? I still have the 3GB OEM folder that was in C / backed up and Testdisk shows that the 17GB OEM/recovery partition is still there and intact and is actually called PQService in testdisk which makes me wonder how was the 100MB partition named in testdisk then . There's also 100MB system reserved partition which I think replaced the previous PQSERVICE although it was always 100MB large.

On my Helios 300 it seems like my NVIDIA dGPU has a hardware issue thread The laptop is in-warranty and Acer sent me instructions to send the laptop in. I opened the laptop in order to replace the thermal paste a while back. The temperatures after this were improved and I'm confident it isn't the cause of my GPU issues. But I'm wondering if Acer will see it that way or would they blame me for the GPU being damaged? it's in the linked thread but the GPU basically became unstable during a graphically-intense gaming session . It'll cost me a good bit to ship the laptop to them US shipping to Texas and I'd just like to gauge if I should ship it to them expecting the GPU issue to be fixed under warranty or if they'll claim I did the damage and charge me for it. If they want to charge me for the repair I'd also wonder what the cost would be but I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to afford it in which case I'd have wasted my time and money shipping the laptop to them to start with.

I tried updating the wifi card drivers and it says it has the latest version. I also tried emptying the cache from online recommandations still no good. Does any know of a solution?

My Acer Aspire vn7-792g makes worrying noises after being used for some time. I know everyone's first guess is the fan but I've triple checked it and I really don't think it's the fan. The first noise is what I'd describe as rather quiet noninvasive buzzing. It can be managed for instance when I shut down some apps and software it tends to dissappear. But the second noise the crackling is loud and scary. The laptop works great temperatures are great I also have a cooling pad no throttling no issues. Except for the noises. The noises seem to originate from this place x200B That's where they are by far the loudest. So my question is what is this component right there and could it be causing the noises?

2,fbwooi,AcerOfficial,1,2020/03/02 08:47:42,Morning,Broken hinge and adapter - any cheap options here? I have an Acer Aspire E15 and I've had it going on two plus years now. Recently my bottom right hinge broke off completely and both of the wires next to the adapter are ripped as well. This was not of my own doing and I've read lots of people have had issues with these just breaking over time. So my WiFi is spotty at best and regularly disconnects and will reconnect and disconnect at random intervals. This makes it very difficult for me as I do have 3 online courses this semester and I kinda need my internet to do my classwork lol. Right now positioning the laptop at a certain angle MAY let it work sometimes it's very slow though and it could disconnect at any moment when doing that. My question is is there anything I can do to fix this cheaply or should I just start shopping for a new computer? I really wanted this one to get me through school I'm on my third year now so I'd like to fix it for a low cost if I can. Is there anywhere that would replace the parts for a decent price?

I had to replace my AC adapter late last fall and shortly after that the battery started giving me trouble. It charges up to 100% and as it hits 100 it disconnects the power supply and switches to battery. For a split second the charge lists at around 95% then jumps to 99% and then hits 100 only to disconnect again. This takes no longer than 15 seconds per cycle and often more like 10 seconds. I play WoW. This used to only happen when I was playing WoW and even then only intermittently. I wondered if it was a software issue. But now it happens when I'm just running Chrome. As you can imagine it's pretty annoying when you're trying to play a game and your screen darkens and lightens that often. Obviously I've tried a restart. The battery settings are set to Balanced. Turn Off Display is set at 5 minutes Battery 10 minutes Power Supply. Sleep is at 15 each. Is it the adapter? This didn't start immediately after it was replaced but it only happened while gaming once it started. Is it the battery? The machine was bought in March 2018.

5,f8egnd,AcerOfficial,0,2020/02/24 11:33:56,Morning,Heads up Swift 5 and Swift 3 models with Ice Lake CPU received drastically lowered RAM speed due to BSOD issue I just bought a Swift 5 SF514-54GT. It's nice overall and seems to work fine. However I noticed the memory runs at 2660 MHz at pretty horrific 24-24-24-56-1T timings. This is reported by both HWiNFO and AIDA64. The measured read bandwidth with AIDA64 is 38 GB/s compared to around 54 GB/s on a Surface Laptop. Latency fairs a bit better at 101 ns vs 93 ns. The memory chips in this laptop are actually high-spec SK Hynix LPDDR4X-4266 and should be running at 3733 MHz maximum supported by the CPU if the design was working as intended. It seems some sort of hardware issue meant they had to back off the clocks considerably losing around 30% of the memory bandwidth. The first officially release BIOS for this model actually has the following description on Acer's site Disable Memory configure of SAGV for MFG BSOD issue So it appears they had to disable the System Agent dynamic memory clocking due to getting blue screens of death. The same issue seems to exist on at least Swift 3 as well. Just thought I'd mention this here since it's nice to at least know of it before spending the money. The computer seems to perform fine although slightly lower in a few tests when compared to benchmarks of other models. My particular model has an MX 250 GPU with dedicated GDDR5 so I'm less reliant on high memory bandwidth. Models with only the integrated graphics might be more negatively affected when running graphics heavy content. If anyone from Acer would happen to read this Do you have any comments?

Well I thought this was just a forced windows update of some strange kind and so I checked for updates and there were some apparently so I did all that. And then AGAIN it happened..... Was playing another game about an hour later and it just black screened with the predator logo boot up and just brought me back to the login screen instead of a windows update. Did anyone ever have issues with their predator doing this? I can only think of it being a cpu or overheating problem... I don't turn the turbo mode on when playing since the cpu temperature is around 60 during League since it doesn't seem like I'd have to. I do have a logitech keyboard ontop of the laptop so I can think that might be it but this is extremely frustrating...,0.038,0.919,0.043,-0.0142,0,0

So when I turn it back on it’s still max volume and all other settings like brightness and colour get reset. Also when I turn it on without having anything else in it just rotates between colours continuously. What am I doing wrong here? EDIT I fixed it by resetting the monitor. Works like a charm like now!

But if I take the back off and push the hard drive in it works. So I'm assuming the part that the hard drive goes into is kind of loose. Should I replace that part? Also I have no idea what name for it is. Issue 2. I've switched hard drives and it seems to work a few times but then continues happening. Is it possible it's my motherboard ? If you need anymore info to try and help me feel free to message me or reply! I still have all the original stickers on the back of the laptop if that helps with anything .

Unfortunately my laptop has been struggling to boot for a while. I thought this was a problem with the battery because that stopped working completely and I had to pay to order a new one and have it replaced. My laptop is charging now but it still has problems. My laptop is finicky to respond to the power button. I need to hold it down for about 20 seconds before it slowly turns on. Sometimes it doesn't respond at all. This seems to happen whenever my laptop is in rest for more than a few hours. Sometimes the laptop boots to my lock screen but freezes. Sometimes it boots and the screen is totally dark the only indication its on being the glowing keys and a blue light on the side. Other issues I have noticed is a space issue I'm having difficulty resolving because my computer won't let me uninstall the Sims 4 which is taking up a lot of space. Could this be connected to a virus? I have run both Windows Defender and Malwarebytes but they haven't detected anything nasty. I unfortunately do not have any back ups on my computer. If this is a virus issue that is too powerful for my freeware anti virus software I am open to trying a factory reset. Please give me some advice. I'm a working student who relies on my laptop to do work. I need to resolve this issue soon and cost effectively. Thanks.,0.085,0.81,0.105,0.8846,1,1

Worked great for a little while but after a Windows update at one point it started to crash constantly. BSODs with various causes listed. Rolling back the update didn't seem to help and after a while it crashed enough that it had to repair the OS. By now I've spent more time resetting it or reinstalling Windows than I have using it. Acer support told me to eat it. So... maybe someone has some advice? The cause of the issue appears to be the Intel display drivers. It took a while to narrow it down but I've found that it doesn't crash if I remove the Intel drivers and block them from reinstalling. Or at least it seems like it's stable in that configuration. Unfortunately it's stuck using the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter. I've tried the old drivers from Acer's site the new ones from Intel various other ones of different vintages that I was able to find but it seems that any version of the Intel display driver causes the crashing to return. The recovery partition seems to have gotten screwed in one of the wipes because I can't boot to that. I don't have recovery media because I'm a dumbass and didn't think it was important. You can't download an image of the original install and I don't really want to shell out the 50 to get one from Acer because I strongly suspect that it'll just happen again as soon as Windows updates. I can live with the Microsoft display adapter as long as that's a viable option. I can't find a lot of details about it except everyone saying not to use it or telling you how to get rid of it by installing the right drivers. Anyone have any thoughts or experience in this area?

This does not appear to happen when Freesync is disabled via Radeon Adrenalin settings. I have tried reinstalling and updating display drivers from AMD no fix. I tried installing the latest display drivers from Acer no fix. I have tried different HDMI cables no fix. I have tried different HDMI ports on the GPU and the monitor no fix. I don't have a DP cable to test it with. I have not yet messed with programs like CRU. I'm thinking about reinstalling Windows just to eliminate the possibility of it being a software issue. I have it set to 120 Mhz for browsing/desktop use where I have no issues. When I'm playing a game I usually try to limit FPS to 60. I thought that maybe it was related to the FPS dropping below the Freesync range 48-144 but it seems to happen even at a steady 60 FPS. I thought maybe it was related to enhanced sync being enabled but it happens whether enhanced sync is on or off.

I currently own a Switch Alpha 12 I was buying it primarily to take handwritten notes on OneNote at school during lectures. However I did not check the availability of the stylus before buying the computer. I checked on Acer's website and it seems that there is only one of their styluses that is compatible with the SA12 if I did read correctly. I did not find any retailer near me or online that had an original Acer stylus. I did buy an aftermarket stylus that relies on the touch screen but more often than not it lags and flings everywhere and does not have palm rejection. So my question is this is there any other alternative to the original stylus that apparently isn't sold anymore apparently? Thank y'all have a good one! D,0.0,0.868,0.132,0.9589,1,1

Full disclosure I am not very education on computers. I work in Automotive and that is where my strengths are so please bear with me! Here are the specs of said laptop Intel Core™ i7-9750H processor 2.60GHz Hexa-Core NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 with 4GB GDDR5 15.6 Full HD 1 920 x 1 080 IPS display w/ ComfyView Technology 16GB DDR4 SDRAM 512GB SSD storage Windows 10 Home 64-bit HDMI USB 3.1 Type-C™ USB 3.1 Type A and USB 2.0 ports connectivities I have one of those MonitoLaptop stands from Amazon. Has many holes for cooling. The only game I currently play on it is Rust which can easily be 2 hours to 10 hours of constant gaming. I noticed that at odd times the game would lag slightly not exactly what I wanted to experience on my pricey purchase. I opened NitroSense to view my CPU and GPU temperatures. I can't remember exactly what the GPU was but I think it was in the high 60 F range. Don't quote me on that. However my CPU temperature reached 95 F. It wasn't currently at 95 F I just saw that was the high score ? for the day on my laptop I keep an eye on my NitroSense gauges when playing and when its constantly reaching mid 90's I turn Max Fan on. 8/10 times temperature goes down significantly others it will still stay in the lower 90 I adjusted some settings on the NitroSense such as turning on CoolBoost and is on HighPerformance. I have found the Max temperature on the CPU to be pushing 100 F and it may have even reached that high. I called Memory Express I opted out of their in house warranty I might be slightly regretting it and spoke with a tech that said it sounds like it might be getting a little hot but the best bet would be to bring it into them they would ship it to Acer and they would diagnose it from there. x200B I am curious if that is normal operating temperatures for a laptop running Rust? Should I send my laptop into Acer to ensure it is operating as designed? Is there something I am doing wrong? x200B TL DR Laptop runs at 95 F - 100 F playing Rust. Unsure if that is proper operating temperature of a game like that. Have to turn on MaxFan sometimes.,0.038,0.863,0.099,0.9699,1,1

2,er71br,AcerOfficial,0,2020/01/20 19:07:41,Evening,Acer XF270H Colors are terrible.... The issue who's color's are they The fix. The Short answer - Its not Acer's colors that are messed up... Agreed... Colors are not good upon initial setup on Windows 10 build 191206-1406. So like most of you who have stumbled here looking for a solution I stumbled through many a web page... In my search I did notice something consistent. Anyone who had installed the monitor under Ubuntu or other Linux distribution didn't have a problem until they used the monitor on Windows... By default there is no Windows Acer driver for the XF270H so Windows uses - Generic PNP monitor - as the driver perfectly acceptable . Except Windows uses it own .icc file to determine colors and not Acer's. Therefore it's Windows colors that are messed up and not Acer's. The Fix Install Acer's .icc color pallet configuration file. How Summary 1. Download Driver for XF270H 2. Extract file to find Acer XF270H A.icm 3. In Windows 10 type Color Management in the Box 4. Go to Devices - confirm you are looking at the correct monitor then check the box Use my settings for this device click add at the bottom of that page Browse where you extracted the downloaded Acer driver double click on the .icm file there is only one click OK or maybe just close. I recommend restarting your system. Detail Go to Acer Support page for the XF270H try this link and download the drivers file... I know above I just said there is no Acer driver - well it is not an installable driver but some some configuration files listed under the heading Drivers. Place the file you downloaded into a new/empty folder as the file is compressed and needs to be extracted. Go into Windows File Manager - Extract the file by double clicking on it ONLY after you have placed it in a new folder by itself. The file Acer XF270H A.icm is the file you will need. Follow the instruction from Windows Central .com in the following link. Once you open this link page down about 6 or 7 times until you find How to install color profile for your monitor ,0.023,0.931,0.046,0.7383,1,1

I'm asking as the vesa holes are slanted to one side in portrait mode - just wondering if this is safe as there are various implementations of the Vesa standard - one of which mentions if the monitor is designed to be used in portrait mode.

I had to reset the laptop because no one knew the login info for it I wasn't too bothered about losing the data and set it up as new. When it was set up all seemed to be working fine except for the fact that the scroll function on the touchpad wasn't working. After doing some research I found out that it could either be because the touchpad was set to basic in the BIOS menu or because the driver was out of date. The first thing I did was change the touchpad setting to advanced in the BIOS menu after which it was still working. Then I updated the driver to version 13.6.3.1 which apparently was successful so I restarted the laptop however when I attempted to use the touchpad it's now totally unresponsive. When I try to check the device manager it only shows the USB mouse I'm now having to use and when I check the Hardware tab in Settings Devices Mouse Touchpad Additional Mouse Options it again only shows the USB mouse. When I select the Elantech tab everything is greyed out however it says that the driver there is a different version to the one I installed 11.15.0.18 X64 . So I don't really understand what's happened. Any help would be extremely appreciated as I can't seem to find anything on the internet that matches my issue most of the questions and posts that I can find are from people that have updated the whole OS not just the touchpad driver.

4,eogeej,AcerOfficial,2,2020/01/14 20:40:20,Evening,A couple questions about the Aspire E E5-575-52jf I have a friend with one of these laptops. She thought it was beyond repair because of a charger battery issues. I found a replacement charger for her online no problem. But I'm having a difficult time sourcing a replaceable battery. I'd like to know if all E5-575 batteries are compatible. I wish I could look at her battery to compare to what I've found online but unfortunately a technician looked at the laptop previously and removed it. In the online listings I never see the specific model number listed 52JF . But one of the sites did state they're all compatible. Separate from this I'd like to know what ram is compatible with this laptop. I found some on Amazon but it was literally 3 sticks which I found underwhelming. On the topic of upgrades I'd like her to get an SSD and place the HD in a CD caddy. I've no idea if all cd caddies are universal though and again which would work with this laptop.

My Aspire E1-571 when plugged in shows the battery as charging for 14 seconds then not for 9 seconds then charging for 14 seconds and so on. The charger powers the laptop fine when the battery is removed and as it is such a consistent cycle I think it is a software fault. I have tried uninstalling the battery from device manager which briefly fixed the issue when it was re-installed but it's still happening. Is there anything else I can try to fix it? I am using a third-party battery and charger originals died laptop is 7 years old so I'm well aware they could be the issue. Finally if I can't fix it is there anyway to disable the system beep that plays when the charger is plugged in or unplugged? I could deal with the inconsistent charging if it was silent! There's no option I can see in the sound settings or in the BIOS options. Thanks.,0.072,0.864,0.064,-0.3431,-1,0

Hes dropped a glass of water over it waited for 2 or 3 and then checked if its still working. He said he could still boot into BIOS so i took it to see if i could repair it. I checked for any water stains inside but there were nothing. Only the HDD died. So i replaced it installed Ubuntu and Windows 10 and checked for any problem. Anything works except for one thing the trackpad behaves pretty strange on Windows 10. On Ubuntu every works fine i can scroll with 2 fingers sensetivety and clicking is fine. On Windows 10 the movement is pretty bad and i can't scroll with 2 fingers... i installed the Synaptic driver from acer.com reboot then uninstalled and installed the ELANTECH reboot but still nothing is working.. I'd go for a faulty touchpad but since it's working fine on Ubuntu i can't explain whats wrong with it... I installed Windows 10 through a flash drive. Anyone had the same problem or maybe knows what else i could try x200B x200B Edit i solved the problem faster than i expected! Uninstalled all driver for the touchpad went to the BIOS and there was actually an option where you can set the touchpad to custom.

When I plug in wired headphone the audio driver does not switch to Headphone mode but stick to Speaker mode. This means I can't use Dolby Atmos or Windows Sonic spatial sound in my games. Strangely my BT AKG headphone was able to trigger these modes. And it's a huge difference during FPS games. So would really love to use spatial sound with my wired cans. 2. The specs say it comes with RGB keyboard. Heck there is even a sticker on the laptop that it comes with 4 zone RGB. Yet I don't see the lighting module in Predator Sense. Only Blue backlight is available. Btw the 120hz color coverage is really bad though brightness is acceptable. Otherwise the performance is really impressive!

2,edsl76,AcerOfficial,3,2019/12/22 09:24:57,Morning,Acer Aspire E1-570G So here’s my experience with that notebook. It’s second ram slot did not work. Sometimes it would suddenly shut down out of the blue like if it had no power even when in charge. Hdmi port stopped working after a while. It’s made of cheap plastic basically screen frame broke easily. Ethernet is maxed out at 480mbps USB2 speed . SD card reader doesn’t work at all with Linux. Acer official support only supports windows related questions. When asked how to reset the bios and how to delete uefi entries I had no response whatsoever. They pointed me to contact a local authorized repair center for resetting bios? Ridiculous . Also nvidia video card does not play nice with Linux. I had to change the whole mainboard so I had the second ram slot and HDMI working finally. Upgraded ram to 16G which is the maximum amount of memory supported . I upgraded the wifi card to an Intel wifi ac Bluetooth model. I had to apply tape to a pin in order to make Bluetooth work and stabilize wifi. I upgraded the stock 1TB 5400rpm hard disk to an ssd. I removed the optical media drive and added a second ssd with the help of an adapter. I obviously installed Linux using the first ssd for / partition and the second ssd for /home partition. I moved /var and /tmp to tmpfs ram drive . After all that it is fairly usable but it keeps on slowly disintegrating due to the very cheap plastic it is made of. Still I can’t make use of the SD Card slot in any way and STILL I do not know how to reset the bios or delete uefi entries. In conclusion due to myself being a Linux-only user and expecting a decent quality product and support I would not buy acer products ever again.,0.042,0.912,0.046,0.5293,1,1

2,e4mjw2,AcerOfficial,6,2019/12/02 11:48:57,Morning,Issues with the ED273 Hi all I bought the ED273 Monitor off of Amazon about a year ago. It's had some issues here and there brightness flickering as seen in this review My issue was far more apparent than the review but seems to be lessened now that I have a new DP cable and a fresh install of Windows. I've heard the problem arises when a non-144hz monitor is plugged in so I'm afraid of plugging in my 60hz auxiliary monitor. This issue has been apparent since the original purchase but only got worse a month ago near constant brightness changes in all corners . Using a 1080 and the monitor is gsync compatible so I thought this was going to be a good purchase. The Acer Display Widget doesn't appear to work with this monitor. All right but one reviewer appears to have it working. I left a message for them a long time ago and didn't expect to hear back. I then went to Acer Support and they said the monitor was not supported. I checked the reviewer the other day and they said it worked after updating GPU drivers which still did not work for me. The customer support is largely unhelpful and is clearly struggling to understand the things I say. I'll explain problems in detail and the regular response is turn the monitor off/on again or use a different cable after which they say they can't help any further. Using the warranty means I have to pay for shipping and this is a large fragile device so shipping would be understandably expensive. This is coming off terribly ranty but I'm just not impressed with the product and the level of service from Acer.

When I have it plugged in the orange light comes on saying it's charging and when I press the power button the blue light comes on which means it's on. However the light stays on for about 30 seconds and the laptop sounds like it's turning on but nothing is happening on the screen and then after 30 seconds it shuts off and does the same thing over and over again. This laptop is almost 5 years old. Any solutions on how to possibly fix this issue? Thanks!,0.035,0.891,0.074,0.658,1,1

It just shut down out of nowhere and while it'll charge the on button won't work. I had somebody look at it and said it might be the keyboard. Since I've only had the computer for a few months the warranty to get it fixed should still be good. I f I do get it fixed will it wipe out the data or should it be good?

I've heard reports of people with certain Acer laptops being able to sometimes gain access to an unrestricted BIOS settings menu. Some speculate you can hold a key or combination down at some point while others have had it triggered randomly. One person claimed it happened after they connected a new HDD but only once after the first boot. It would likely vary depending on the laptop model but does Acer have any actual instructions or support official or unofficial for this for any of their laptops or desktops?,0.0,0.921,0.079,0.7691,1,1

In the middle of a game the screen went white and won’t show so much as the built in menu. When it went white I still had game audio and could interact with the game. I’ve tried a second monitor with my pc and it worked fine. Unplugging everything from the monitor but the power cable still only shows a white screen. I’ve scoured Acer forums YouTube and Google for any other information I could find. The monitor is only 13 months old from purchase and was under warranty until I took it apart myself because I didn’t plan on going through the process of sending it in. I’ve checked the connectors to make sure they’re secure and for any blown capacitors as these were the most common reasons for a white screen that I came across but to no avail. I’m not entirely sure what the problem could be and was wondering if anyone here might have an idea as to what is going on?

Hi I purchased a Predator Helios 300 NH.Q5PEX.025 and it came with a resource dvd that I assume has drivers and utilities but the laptop itself doesn't have a dvd-rom lol so you obviously can't use it. I installed win 10 on it and ran all the updates touchpad display drivers probably work since it's working but the Predator Sense and Turbo mode button don't do...anything? I assume they need drivers so I installed Acer Care and whatever predator sense utility is but it changed nothing and those buttons still don't do anything.

Hello so I bought an Acer Spin 1 SP111-32N and in the first few months of usage the screen was fine but then I found out that the corners were getting a bit brighter than the middle each corner had a different brightness but at this point it was only visible when it was darker later few weeks it got a bit worse so I called the acer support number in Czech Republic and arranged that I will pack it and send it to them a guy from a shiping company came and picked it up so I wait for a week and get it back look at the screen and it is even worse! So I call them again and arrange that I will send it to them again and when I get it back it just said that the brightness difference is under some legal limit and that they don't have to repair it so now about 3 months later it is about 10% brighter on darker images around edges of the screen on 50% brightness I use this laptop for programing which I have completely in dark colors and for watching movies .

As usual I upgraded the RAM and got WD M.2 SSD and used the recovery OS given by ACER website and used all the default given drivers and only thing I updated was the bios which didn't allow me to install Ubuntu and Linux on to the SSD. Now the problem is that last Saturday while i was watching a video the laptop keyboard suddenly stopped responding and only the touchpad and the power button worked. Now after googling there were numerous reports of this problem and had to reset the laptop's battery and uninstall the standard PS/2 keyboard driver and had to restart to windows and ubuntu to check if it worked and it did. Unfortunately today suddenly again the keyboard stopped working and no solution on the Google forums helped me. I have some projects to show and I need the laptop for that on Wednesday.

There’s an issue with the backlight where it’s dark on the middle bottom quarter of the screen. Anyone here ever send something like this back in for repairs? Sucks when an item over 500 doesn’t give you a 100/year performance. Also are you committed to sending something in once you start the acre self support service?

It's making a funny noise close to the fans.... is not the sound of the fans themselves but more like an Rrrrrrr type of sound like if the fans where hitting a little piece of paper. This is not affecting the laptop's performance but it is quite annoying and I worry this could be something that might affect the laptop on the long run... BTW I don't have warranty because I'm out of the country... Also I've noticed that the temps rise quite high 80-90 C while running games for a short time... like an hour the most...The surface right above the keyboard gets burning hot you can't even keep a finger more than a second on it... is there a way to counter this effects? Some say to underclock it others say not to do this... Some say buy a cooler pad others say this can damage the laptop's fans performance... Some say to buy a laptop fan cooler others say not to...Others say changing the thermal paste on it...Some say to upgrade the BIOS for better performance others say not to mess with updates only if necessary... etc So what can I really do about the temps?,0.055,0.845,0.1,0.8522,1,1

In the OSD menu Turn off FreeSync 4k-144hz and HDR. 2. Connect screen to GPU using both DP cables 3. Turn 4k-144hz mode back on in the OSD menu. 4. The res 4k 144hz should now be available in e.g Nvidia Control Panel 5. Download Acer Display Widget and select HDR Reason why I’m writing this I called Acer Support in Sweden and they were ro absolutely no help what so ever. First time I called the guy took my email and said he was going to ”look things up” and reconnect to me via email. Never happened. Second time I called the girl at support argued with me that 144hz is not necessarily supported just brcause it says so on the box. She kept arguing that the computer detects the suported modes and theres nothing they can help me with. Then she told me I have to Lower the resolution in order to access 144hz. I asked her if they have a manual online because I didn’t get one in the box. She said ”No”. Finally she told me ”If anyone knows about our products it’s us ok?”. Ok Trump whatever. I called a third time and got connected with some guy. He took my email and promised a reply. He replied by email confirming that 4k 144hz is possible with AMD cards. Wait. That’s all you have to say? Ok. I then proceeded to call Acer US Support. The guy kept asking about serial number and SNID number just to eventually say ”Sir I’m getting an Emachines computer here.” I was like ”what? No I’m calling about an Acer XV273K monitor what are you talking about?!” Then he told me ”I will have to put you on hold for 2 minutes.” And I was like ”Why? For what?” ”Well to confirm that it is a monitor”. And I was like ”Well yeah because I just gave you the model of the product I need help with. Now you just have to help me. What do you mean?” Anyways he put me on hold just for it all to disconnect after 10 minutes. Not once did they even bother to step me through any settings or anything. It’s unreal how you pay 800 dollars and get no support and incomplete manual. Thanks Acer. Never again.,0.053,0.836,0.112,0.9742,1,1

Thanks This device is a week old and it came with Linux. I bought it at the very well-know German notebook shop notebooksbilliger.de Everything worked great until I put in a second regular SSD Samsung 860 EVO 1TB. The factory M.2 SSD stays in and it is the one keeping my Linux OS. 2 things up first I always disconnect the battery when upgrading first! I googled and youtubed this like hell yesterday There is no boot option Legacy in my Bios - UEFI ONLY! Upgrade was super easy. Took me 20min. Watched official video from Acer on YouTube. I reconnect battery. I reboot and check the BIOS first. The first Main page shows all my drives with Manufacturer and Model number. I reboot to boot Manjaro Linux. Everything fine. Both drives are shown. I format the new SSD! I shutdown and put the bottom case on properly again and screw the screws back in. I reboot No bootable device found . My body shivers hot and cold and my pulse goes to 200. I reset the BIOS many times by pressing power button for 2 minutes Nothing. I disconnect the SSD again. Nothing. I boot a Linux live USB stick. Hard drives do not show. I find out Manjaro Live USB lets me detect other bootloaders. It finds my M.2 SSD's grub efi file. How if the BIOS cannot find the drives? WTF???? My operating system boots flawlessly. All drives are detected and readable and writable. I can now only boot my OS from a USB Manjaro Stick. I can never install another OS again? UPDATE this morning suddenly also the Live Linux from USB recognizes my drive. For a split second before the boot menu of the Manjaro Live USB stick came up I THINK I saw my regualar system's grub menu in plain black and grey. The Manjaro Live Bootloader does NOT look like this at all! Does anyone have any news on this bug?,0.046,0.868,0.086,0.9334,1,1

Issue 1 - No bootable drive 1. Laptop started crashing by itself in its first week. 2. Then in its first week SSD can't be detected anymore. 3. Since it's in its first week I had the laptop replaced. Issue 2 - Charger gave up 1. 1 week in second laptop's charger gave up. They had to replace it. Issue 3 - No bootable drive 1. After 3 months of usage the same thing happened. 2. Same symptoms as before but lasted much longer before giving up. 3. Laptop crashes when playing light games or doing photoshop so I had to restart it. 4. After restarting it works well until last September where it said no bootable drive 5. SSD was broken 6. They had to replace the SSD since it was broken so I waited for 2 weeks. Issue 4 - MOBO was broken 1. After getting my SSD replaced the first night I tested it it was lagging. 2. Computer lags then freezes then restarts by itself. 3. I brought it to Gigahertz store then they diagnosed each part. 4. MOBO was failing so they had to replace it.

2,dj76vh,AcerOfficial,2,2019/10/18 06:31:05,Night,Problems with my Acer Nitro 5 Hey I hope I'm in the right place with this one. Quick backstory Bought my Acer Nitro 5 in summer in 2017. Used to play average-req game such as Overwatch LoL or Heartstone. All good then but after some time I didnt have time to play anymore so I quit doing so. Recently I decided to jump into Overwatch again and it started to lag. Previously I would get 120fps in Overwatch and now I get 30-45. Few days ago I reinstalled windows thinking this might be the problem since I didn't do that not even once while having laptop. Still lag I'd say even more lag. I checked a lot of guides on google and youtube and nothing seems to help it. May there be anything I missed that would cause these issues?,0.14,0.788,0.073,-0.8954,-1,0

Everything is working great EXCEPT the wifi. I have 60 Mbps down 5 up. I moved to within 7 feet of the router visible in a straight line and the best I got was 10 Mbps with a horrendous loaded latency 300ms using fast.com . Tested on multiple other devices from the same location Macbook Google Pixel and got 30 Mbps 100ms loaded latency. I wiped all of the killer control center software and retested same results. I reinstalled the killer control software retested same results. I grabbed 2 different USB wifi receivers I use on desktop computers in the furthest part of the house where I usually get 20-40 Mbps 150 loaded latency and I still got bad results. I tested out the 2G and 5G bands same bad results. Plugged an ethernet into the router and get a perfect 60 Mbps down 5up 50ms loaded latency. It's very much less than ideal to have this always plugged in and it seems clear something is off with the wifi so looking for any tips and tricks that have helped people.

I have a new inquery I'm kind of a noob for gaming settings so What are the best settings for the Acer Predator Controller program the one that controls the fans and monitors temps for gaming activities ? And overall... what do you suggest I setup on the laptop for gaming software/hardware-wise ? e.g. should I put the laptop fans on max throttle the whole gaming session? should I configure power settings to max performance? should I put the computer on a cooler base with the cooler fans at top speed? Should I download a performance booster like Razer Cortex ? x200B Thank you!,0.012,0.868,0.121,0.9282,1,1

Tried reseating cables powering PC off Monitor OFF etc. I've tested this with both HDMI and DVI plugged into my desktop and even plugged it into my laptop to confirm there wasn't an issue with the graphics card.

Hi Reddit-Acer-Gaming-Peps So I've just adquired my Acer Predator Helios 300 and I've been reading some threads on Acer and other sites about things you can and can't do to it... 1. First I've read that it has the Windows Product Key directly placed on the BIOS... is this true? and what does that mean? Can I change the OS to a Windows Pro without issues? 2. Second is that I want to keep it very well maintained so It can last as long as it should without any issues... Are there any softwares I need to dowload? or specific Settings so it can perform as clean as possible? things to check every now and then ...? 3. I've read that for gaming tasks is recommendable to get a laptop cooler and to undervolt it and some other stuff... What do you recommend?

I expected it to ship with Ubuntu Fedora or Debian. But It shipped with a Linux with inactive community. I know I can remove it and install any other distro. But I'm curious why Acer use Endless OS? Why not use something like Ubuntu or Fedora? Endless OS came with nouvea drivers Open source bad Nvidia driver that heats GPU and drain battery for no reason . If a user stick with it more than 3 hours the GPU and internels could suffer damages. It's that bad. Why the Linux wasn't even optimized for the hardware like Dell laptops do?

So i recently purchased Corsair k95 rgb keyboard which I plug into USB 3.0 port. The problem is that when I turn the laptop off the keyboard lights keep working. The only thing that helps is if I unplug and plug the keyboard back in which is certainly annoying to do every time I shut the system down. I have tried updating drivers and installing acer quick access software which does have option 'Power off usb charging' but unfortunately turning it off there doesn't seem to do anything. I should mention that the problem doesn't exist if the keyboard is plugged into USB 2.0 port. Switching it to that port wouldn't resolve my problem since I would have the same issue with other peripherals then. I entered BIOS and searched but there doesn't seem to be such option.

Additionally if the display panel is divided into 9 equal rectangular areas there shall not be more than one defective pixel in the central area of the display. x200B Which would mean that for a 4K display like mine if there isn't at least one dead pixels in the center area it would require 32 dead pixels to be covered by the warranty which is a ridiculously high number. x200B x200B On the other hand this web page clearly states that the threshold of dead sub-pixel is 5 regardless of the resolution which seems to be a standard policy across makers x200B So what's going on!?,0.163,0.758,0.079,-0.9628,-1,0

I've sent my predator desktop off for repair as the SSD was faulty. When Acer have got in touch they have said they will repair the SSD under warranty however they have noted damage to the chassis and front Bezel and are quoting to repair that. When I called the centre to ask for photos of the damage that have said that they only provide videos at a cost of 10. Has anyone heard of this previously? I'd like to know if I'm the only one who feels that this is an extortionate charge.,0.073,0.906,0.02,-0.7622,-1,0

Currently none of the buttons for OSD input or even the on / led are working. After popping it out a little bit I can see that the strip has been removed from the front panel board. I can't figure out how to get around and open it up so it's easily accessible and and I re-attach the strip. I have looked for manuals on how to do this but can't find anything.

System specs Acer Aspire E5-571-5428 My issues 1 I want to know whether there is an empty SSD slot in my Laptop that I can use ? Also the specification of the SSD that's compatible with the slot? Otherwise im gonna go with a caddy installation setup and remove my optical drive. 2 My system is running on the initial BIOS that was on the Laptop I never upgraded it as I found no performance issues whatsoever should I update BIOS before SSD installation ? Its running 2014 BIOS V1.08 i.e. before the spectre meltdown patch if at all there was a BIOS patch . Also I kept reading that before loading the SSD I need to update BIOS so that system is more compatible with the SSD ? 3 Could you also help me with a link for the original user manual detailing the motherboard and other internal configurations of the system like the SATA compatibility of the Drive port ? I presume SATA III Ram card configuration specs etc ? I tried the conventional links at acer website but the simply have user manuals stating the bare minimum specs of the device which is not so useful to help me upgrade the laptop internals. I am right now running on a singe 4gb Ram card I have an old Dell that got busted it uses a 2x 3gb Ram Card. P.S.

I fell in love with teh Aspire One decked it out and now I'm sitting here on an F5 7th gen i5 GeForce 950 w/ 4 GB to give you some context. I think I may buy a new laptop in the next few weeks. Either that or upgrade this thing... maybe I'll just put two big SSD's into it and max out the RAM. However since I always find Acers to be notoriously cheap in a good way it wouldn't break the bank for me to just get a new one! Maybe there's something a little slimmer? Maybe something of the same size but more powerful? An 8th gen i5 or i7 would be an improvement on battery life at least...,0.0,0.882,0.118,0.9324,1,1

The problem is it will turn off after 5 minutes or I'm not sure if it's something else triggering the screen to turn off and sometimes it won't come back on the power and charge light are still on and the keyboard will light up and I can hear the fan but the screen remains off. Is there a solution to this? Or possibly another way to keep my computer downloading on sleep or hibernation mode?

5,cy3rz1,AcerOfficial,2,2019/09/01 17:15:23,Afternoon,A weird bricked Acer aspire V3 772g I've had this laptop for years now and it pulled me through high school. I know its time for an upgrade but I'm saving up for it. I usually don't use this laptop and let it sit it's well taken care of and works like new . Of to its weirdness. So I decided to use the laptop for a bit before I changed the thermal paste. I pressed the power button and nothing happend. Plugged in the charger and still nothing. The charge lights worked fine and the always on USB port worked fine as well. Maybe it was the CMOS so I changed the battery altogether. Yes I let the motherboard sit for a few hours before reinstalling the battery. Screwed everything up and plugged in the power and immediately the laptop turned on except it was a black screen with no hard drive activity but the power light was on. Tried to force shut down by pressing the power button but no response I cannot shut down the laptop unless I remove the charger and the battery Maybe if I let it sit while it's on then something would happen? Nope nothing except it got very hot because the fans don't spin yes I plugged in the fan and yes it does spin a bit when I plug in the power. the laptop still turns on as soon as I plug in the charger I let it sit without the battery or charger CMOS battery in place over night but still a black screen with a power light. Tried the fn esc and plugged in the power with a bios in my USB and no activity light on the USB. The last thing I used on the laptop was a light photoshop edit and then it got a proper shutdown and was tucked away maybe 3 weeks ago. Any help would be appreciated and I will bug the Acer forums later. Laptop is running windows 8.1 and its updated I like 8.1 with all the latest drivers installed.,0.066,0.836,0.098,0.9221,1,1

I have been trying to work out USB-C charging and after hours of research i still cant seem to understand If it does or doesnt work with this laptop model. i tried a standard 65W 20V usb-c laptop charger but it wouldnt work this is either down to the fact i need an ACER branded charger which they dont seem to sell themselves here in the uk or because the standard charger uses 19v instead of the general 15 or 20v all other chargers seem to use. If anyone can provide any info i would be greatly appreciative ive spent hours reading countless opinions of people claiming it does work doesnt work needs a specfic charger etc Also if anyone knows roughly how much repairing the charge port will cost i think its bent and needs replacing that will be useful also.

1,cw5cde,AcerOfficial,1,2019/08/28 06:37:59,Night,Issue with headphone port on Acer Chromebook Spin 13 T I'm posting this in chromeos and AcerOfficial So for university I've purchased an Acer Chromebook Spin 13 the Pentium model linked here It's impressive but there's a problem. Whenever I plug headphones into the jack it doesn't play any audio through them and videos start stuttering/lagging. I definately have the headphones selected in Audio Settings. This happens on different sets of headphones ones with and without microphones. I need to close the lid/restart for the audio to come back through the speakers and for videos to play smoothly taking the headphones out isn't enough. I thought the headphone port was stiff and needed more force to insert the 3.5mm jack than my other devices. I believed this to be a hardware fault so I returned the Acer to the store and got a replacement sent through. It arrived today and I'm typing on it now and it exhibits the EXACT same behaviour. Plugging any headphones into the port leads to silence and stuttering videos. I am currently listening to audio through an USB sound card and it's working perfectly with the headphones that don't work in the port. I've Powerwashed it and restored settings no change. Is this just a software issue that I should report or is this likely a hardware fault common to the batch that the retailer has in stock? I'm considering buying a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter and living with it. Any help would be appreciated.,0.082,0.846,0.072,-0.1174,-1,0

I thought it was an overheating problem but even undervolting and running my fans at max made no difference.

There are two switches one is the classic button that every monitor has and the other is an I/O switch... and both end up doing the same thing. HOWEVER my actual question is how do you just simply turn off the monitor instead of it shutting off completely? x200B x200B Explanation - I have another Acer monitor s271hl and had a dell monitor together to be a dual monitor setup . Press their power buttons the monitor would go black and the other monitor would be exactly as is. Open applications and desktop icons remain in their places. - I replaced the dell monitor with this new acer one the xf270h . It causes a few problems but it essentially stems from the fact that instead of just powering off like any old monitor... it completely shuts down or something. i.e. press either of its two power buttons... and all the desktop icons and open applications move over to my other Acer monitor until I turn it back on. Even the task bar's messenger icon and show desktop bar thingy that's on the primary monitor moves over... as if that monitor becomes non-existant. - The same thing does not happen when I turn off the s271hl and leave the xf270h on. - I have windows 10 Radeon RX 580 gpu this is also new... but its not like the old acer is affected so i dont think its the gpu's fault New Acer is connected to its Display Port and Old Acer is connected to its HDMI. Admittedly the Dell was only ever connected to another hdmi port so... that's an untested variable. - I am absolutely not a tech components guy so please be specific about what more information you'd need. x200B So how do I make it that turning off the New Acer monitor doesn't completely wipe it off my computer?,0.027,0.938,0.035,0.6627,1,1

So when I'm browsing and doing things. It's not an issue and the battery recharges. But when I fire up a game or something that puts a load on the cpgpu. It seems to actually be pulling power from the battery slowly because gaming for 5-6 hours would easily drain the battery to nothing almost twice over.

4,ci1zqg,AcerOfficial,1,2019/07/27 04:02:52,Night,The future of the Predator Laptop series with AMD chipsets. In case you've been living under a rock with the recent AMD announcements of the new Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs it is now possible to have outstanding performance without having to pay the intel/nvidia premiums. The Helios 300 laptops are by far the best bang for the buck in the entire industry. Nothing compares. Anything less and you won't have such a good experience. Anything more and you'll be paying too much for the extra fps or graphical settings. The juice is just not worth the squeeze. With that in mind I started to theorize what could happen to the Helios lineup with AMD chipsets instead of intel/nvidia's. I see two possible ways of going 1- Use AMD chipsets maintain performance at the current level or mini upgrade but LOWER the laptop price from 1200 back to 1050 or 1000 which was the price of the 2017 model before they added 144hz screen. 2- Use AMD chipsets keep the price at 1200 but upgrade from XX60's equivalent GPU's to XX70's. I am not sure if the form factor would keep it cooled enough the 2019 model sure handles the 1660ti just fine. But it would be nice to see free sync in the panel better IOs and possibly make it even lighter thiner etc. x200B Acer could also keep the GPU at XX60's equivalent and just have the panel with free sync and put the price at a comfortable 1100. We all know that future-proofing is a fallacy in this industry so there's never a reason to spend too much on laptops/parts since they are going to be superseded in 2 3 years. My best guess on how to navigate these waters is to keep using the Helios 300 lineup and get a new one every 2 years. I bought the 2017 Helios 300 model for 1170 with tax and shipping sold it exactly 2 years later for 760 . That's only 410 for 2 years of great performance and reliability. I don't think spending around 500 every 2 years to keep yourself with the most up to date parts is expensive. It is a fair price and if Acer keeps improving this lineup I will most surely continue purchasing the newest models regularly. x200B Thoughts?,0.029,0.846,0.126,0.9922,1,1

I want to disable RAID0 after getting this laptop so here are my questions Do I just have to change the storage mode from RAID to AHCI then fresh install windows? When formating the drives for clean install should I leave the tiny OEM Recovery partition alone? I've also read suggestions that I should only populate the first drive with Win at setup and then create a volume for the second from Windows' partitioning tool. Will this practice be okay for my soon to come Predator Triton 500? It's a hugely expensive laptop and I really don't feel like taking it to another city for warranty if an issue appears. Does the option to switch off RAID0 in favour of AHCI even exist in the Triton 500 BIOS?

I'm now deciding between getting another Y740 since I liked mine so much or giving the Predator a chance since it'a a bit cheaper. I like what I saw on all the reviews but my main concern is the thermals. So to anyone who owns the device Does the CPU or GPU thermal throttle easily when gaming or does it take it a few hours of gaming or does it not do it at all?

1,cbr9v8,AcerOfficial,0,2019/07/11 20:30:06,Evening,Crashes that result in restart Hello all. So back in February I got a Acer Swift 1 SF114-32 laptop and recently I discovered this issue it has been having. I only know for sure its been happening for a month but it might have been happening a bit longer than that. Almost every time this issue has happened I haven't been at the laptop so I come back and I am back on my desktop with no programs open as If I had restarted my computer. At first I thought this was just windows updating while I was away and restarting but one time I had manually updated and restarted and then a hour or two later it restarted again. Upon review there were a few .dmp files but a little over a month ago I had reinstalled windows so there might have been more of these crashes from before then that I had chalked up to windows updates. .dmp files in question Any idea on what the causes of these are and how I might resolve it? I have already updated my bios and upon asking elsewhere I was told the card reader was at fault for atleast a few of them so I reinstalled the card reader driver but still received the latest 2 crashes,0.032,0.936,0.032,-0.2263,-1,0

Hi I've recently bought an Acer Swift 3 8GB RAM MX150 and I've noticed that the CPU throttles a lot to around 800mhz when gaming. I have disabled BDPROCHOT from Throttlestop and have also undervolted but the CPU still throttles a lot dropping framerates considerably and causing stutter.

Would appreciate if there's a discussion/suggestions/reviews I'm about to enter my first year of university and is planning to get a laptop that will last me for the entire university life and maybe even after that. I have always used Acer laptops and really liked the brand and so I am planning to get another Acer laptop. I have narrowed my choices down to Acer Swift SF314-56G and Acer Swift SF514-53T but is now in dilemma which I should get. Here's my criteria for the new laptop Light Affordable approx SGD 1200 but willing to spend more if it's rlly worth it Long battery life nice design good keyboard not too firm wont lag when handling huge productivity work like editing photos for projects. I have done my research and intending to get intel core i7 instead of intel core i5 even tho it would be more expensive. I have yet to make a decision on which I should get as I'm not sure which swift 3 or swift 5 is the best choice for me...hence i would rlly appreciate if there's some discussion between the pros and cons of these models. Suggestions are welcome but would hope that it's between Swift 3 and Swift 5 since I doubt I will be looking into other brands/models . I'm keen to read the reviews of these 2 brands from people who actually owns it too. Edit While doing my research I came across different Swift 3 and Swift 5 models listed on Acer official website and got a little confused. What's the difference between Swift 3 SF314-52G SF314-54G SF314-56G etc. Also here's the links to the models that I'm thinking to get Acer Swift 3 SF314-56G Acer Swift 5 SF514-53T ,0.032,0.75,0.218,0.9947,1,1

I believe the 2060 is max p and the 2070 is max q which is why I rather have the 2060 I hear max q gpus really don't perform to it's full potential so would it be better to get the 1660ti with a 17.3 or the 2060 with the 15.6 inch screen?

However the enter button arrived very sticky and was in fact a French key on an otherwise standard Qwerty set up. The French doesn't bother me it's the stickyness as I have to hit the enter button quite hard to go to New line. I contacted support about getting a new key sent out to replace this which unsurprisingly wasn't allowed. I was then forward a UPS sticker and told to box it myself and contact them for pickup. UPS explicitly state if lost or damaged they accept no liability and best of it is I have to pay for all packaging etc. myself. Am I being unreasonable for expecting a package to be sent out for me to place laptop in to return rather than have to organise myself? The laptop is still under warranty. Also the customer support assistant hasn't been very helpful in email chain and just giving me one line answers with little info around boxing required. TLDR New laptop arrived with faulty enter button that I want replaced. Not a simple return process by any means and not sure if I'm being unreasonable?

Background I'm an EE which isn't must help here without a schematic on my laptop Issue The laptop died while loading up a game. I plug it in..no LEDs lit. I push the battery reset button for 30s and 1 minute still nothing. Hold the power button for a minute and a half..nada. Dead Troubleshooting I figured it hasn't been cleaned since I purchased so it must be an overheating issue. I open the laptop up and clean the fans thoroughly which requires taking the heatsink off the processors. After cleaning I reapply thermal paste close it up still nada. Now I think the battery is shot. Call Acer customer service to get some info out of them since I am no longer under warranty. They say send it in for 630 and they'll fix it. Ha. Start asking what the issue could possibly be after they had me run through their troubleshooting over-the-phone method... They ask if I had my laptop plugged in for an extended period of time. I say I do I treat my laptop as a desktop. Never unplugged. They confirm the battery is shot. I bought the battery online before probing the old battery...mistake...nothing wrong with the old battery. Now I have 2. To be fair I don't have a dmm...had to borrow one from work. With the laptop opened plugged in with battery also connected...the mother board is receiving 19V from the wall...0.145V from the battery. Motherboard is receiving power...still no LEDs lit or power on. I'm out of ideas what could it possibly be? Thanks for any help -Rabbit,0.072,0.877,0.051,-0.8433,-1,0
2,bwowxd,AcerOfficial,6,2019/06/05 05:49:29,Night,Which acer model should i buy? I need help trying to get the best possible model of the Acer nitro 5 I'm also willing to pay somewhere around 900 My current laptop I have is a 300 laptop that has major problems and I just want to hurry up and just buy a new laptop before the one I'm using dies on me or doesn't charge anymore due to the charger port Being somewhat damaged. Also it can run Minecraft around 20-40 fps only which is terrible I'm trying to find a Acer nitro 5 model that can play vr rust and possibly play halo mcc once it comes out to pc. I'll try to respond to any questions you have as fast as I can. Also sorry I suck at writing long posts like these P.s. if there is a better gaming laptop then the Acer nitro 5 that's under 1000 please let me know.,0.086,0.788,0.126,0.7713,1,1
