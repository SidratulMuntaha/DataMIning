ekkvox,SuggestALaptop,Can anyone help me out with purchasing a laptop for audio production? For audio I need tons of cpu power and RAM and not much gpu.Also it would be nice to have the CPU preformance close to or equivalent to the desktop Ryzen 7 3700X. Any suggestions?,0.0,0.878,0.122,0.7059,1

gqt1pd,SuggestALaptop,Looks like a great deal at that price!,0.0,0.42,0.58,0.784,1
gqt1pd,SuggestALaptop,Ideapad or yoga whatever they are called where you are ryzen 4600u ..oh for gaming then get a ryzen 4x00h cpu lenovo or other cheap brand that has a decent enough graphics card for your needs.. just remember that some ryzen cpus models are hyperthreaded some aren't,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gqt1pd,SuggestALaptop,Even I need to buy a gaming laptop.My budget is 75k but at this price point most laptops offer a 3rd gen ryzen 5 or 9th gen i5 with a gtx 1650.There are tons of them on Amazon.I have like 12 of these in my wishlist.But it's hard to choose one.Even I am torn between so many choices.,0.073,0.87,0.058,0.0387,0
gqv6vt,SuggestALaptop,Wow that's a hell of a deal at 599 . This is going to be extremely popular when it releases if it stays at this price. 6 core 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 4600H 8GB RAM 256GB SSD GTX 1650 15.6 1080p 144hz IPS Panel Wifi 6 At 499 I have this recommendation but it's refurbished. but if you can wait for the new nitro 5 above I would get that. It's better in almost every way and brand new. If your budget absolutely can't stretch get this forn499 refurbished. 4 Core 8 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 3550H 8GB RAM expandable 256GB SSD expandable GTX 1050 3GB 15.6 1080p display 499 ,0.026,0.895,0.078,0.6701,1
gqp7ra,SuggestALaptop,I’d just like to mention that the 740 has abysmal battery life. For that reason alone I’d go with the M15. I agree with the G14 that one’s great. Other suggestions would be Razer Blade 15 Eluktronics MAG 15 Aero 17 or 15. Actually now I look at your situation Aero 15 or 17. That display is amazing and is overall a really good laptop for content creation. MSI Prestige is also really good for content creation.,0.022,0.718,0.26,0.9661,1
gqp7ra,SuggestALaptop,Would you be open to a different recommendation that is cheaper and more powerful? These are honestly overpriced and underpowered for what you might be spending on it.,0.0,0.804,0.196,0.7264,1
gqp7ra,SuggestALaptop,Neither. Acer Predatory Helios 300 with RTX 2060 and aluminium body at same price.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gqp7ra,SuggestALaptop,The Aero and MSI models have been catching my eye as well so I might look into those now as well! Double checking on the G14 and I like it the more I read reviews on it as well. All three of these have AMAZING screens which is great for work.,0.0,0.703,0.297,0.9495,1
gqv259,SuggestALaptop,The Lenovo slim has the best processor of all of those laptops with the 4700U being an 8 core chip and all the other ones being literally half at 4 cores. I think the Lenovo slim is the best laptop but 8GB is ok but not great. If you can find this same laptop with 16GB or if you want to add an additional 8GB when you receive the laptop I would absolutely do the Lenovo Slim 7 Keep looking for laptops with the Ryzen 4000 series chips those are the best in the market right now and cheaper than the Intel counterparts.,0.04,0.824,0.137,0.8692,1
gqw84n,SuggestALaptop,It seems it does get warm because the vents are blocked for some stupid reason. You can remove them and also make a setting change to lower the boost clock which barely had any affect on performance and lowers the CPU temp by 20C and fans go silent. Read it here. This applies to the G14 and the G15 Only 4h G15 has blocked vents. ,0.155,0.782,0.063,-0.6908,-1
gqw4b8,SuggestALaptop,This seems to be a good deal for the price! It has a 4 core 8 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500U 8GB of RAM 256GB SSD 15.6 1080p panel And has the biggest batter I could find at this price. 499€ ,0.0,0.914,0.086,0.4926,1
gqv9ai,SuggestALaptop,If you are willing to do a 14 I suggest this. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-12 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a public spaces. It comes with an 3Ghz 8 Core/16 Thread AMD Ryzen 4800HS 16GB RAM expandable to 40GB 512GB SSD expandable GTX 1660Ti 1080p display 120hz 1450 Here are some reviews to help you ,0.0,0.946,0.054,0.6705,1

gqqnu7,SuggestALaptop,that Macs tend to have better build quality. Not necessarily business grade laptops are equally well-built often for a fraction of the price. You might want to full out the form for a more targeted recommendation.,0.0,0.884,0.116,0.4939,1

gqqnu7,SuggestALaptop,If you do computer science with app/ game development then go with Mac because they are Linux based but if computer science / business / corporate then windows. If you’re not doing intensive tasks and just want internet browsing school work and rlly gd battery life then the new Mac air 2020 is perfect,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.7579,1
gquoj0,SuggestALaptop,I think the x360 is a great deal with the newest AMD Ryzen 4000 chips. It beats all of the Intel processors and are generally cheaper I'm couldn't find this in the Singapore HP site but I'll link what I usually copy paste to the US store so you know what to look laptop specs to look for. Also watching Netflix in tent mode on the x360 is amazing. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 13 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light with 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and make sure to get the Intel wifi 6 card. 100% sRGB 1080p IPS Panel.

gqsrg0,SuggestALaptop,1 TB SSD obviously a better choice.,0.0,0.58,0.42,0.4404,1
gqsrg0,SuggestALaptop,You definitely don’t want to be gaming on a i5 Ryzen is cheaper slightly more battery efficient and slightly more powerful than intel. So I’d go with the Ryzen one,0.0,0.722,0.278,0.8238,1
gqs39n,SuggestALaptop,i would recommend zephyrus g14,0.0,0.545,0.455,0.3612,1
gqtky6,SuggestALaptop,Do more research on how to reduce G15 temp.. and your choice will still be G15 like me Quick Link ,0.0,0.884,0.116,0.3612,1
gqcwo0,SuggestALaptop,Depending on your capacity to wait you have the Acer Swift 3 with 4500U/16GB/1TB SSD for 649€ in Germany on pre-order for July. You change the or in your title to and for a couple of months of patience.,0.0,0.952,0.048,0.2023,1
gqcwo0,SuggestALaptop,Absolutely go for the 4500U and higher The 3500U is only 4 cores and is last Gen. Still good but it performs like a 4300U now. 4500U is 6 cores and 4700U is 8 cores.,0.0,0.848,0.152,0.6369,1
gqcwo0,SuggestALaptop,Do they have a dedicated graphics card or integrated,0.0,0.7,0.3,0.4588,1
gqcwo0,SuggestALaptop,get the first one,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gqcwo0,SuggestALaptop,you can always upgrade socketed RAM and SSD later. Can't upgrade the CPU! Make sure to check the service manual to confirm ssd and ram are swappable. Lots of soldered RAM out there. Also Ryzen iGPU will run better in dual channel memory configuration so make sure the board has an open slot if it doesn't come with dual channel ram.,0.0,0.882,0.118,0.7777,1
gqni13,SuggestALaptop,Copying from another comment I just made for under 500 you got 2 great options either this off brand from walmart or This Lenovo Ideapad both offer very similar specs but personally I like the one from Walmart more because according to reviews the build quality is much better and it is also very light at 2.55 lbs iirc.,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.8641,1
gqni13,SuggestALaptop,I recommend this Lenovo Flex 14 AMD This is probably the best deal with the most bang for your buck laptop out right now if you don't need heavy graphics power It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games.

gqo90p,SuggestALaptop,Sims is not a very intensive game so you can get a laptop with integrated graphics. Have a look at the ASUS VivoBook TP412FA-DS51T-CA it is very lightweight so it will be able to fit your portability needs. It has one of the newest processors on the market so it is both powerful and future proof 14 Touch Laptop 14” FHD Intel Core i5-10210U Processor 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Windows 10 Fingerprint Reader Star Grey,0.0,0.914,0.086,0.6705,1
gqo90p,SuggestALaptop,The envy with the Ryzen 4000 chips are really good. They are 8 cores and can game lightly with no problem. I would absolutely get the x360 with Ryzen 4700U 8cores and 16GB RAM. Of your budget cants stretch than the 4500U with 8GB RAM.,0.142,0.793,0.065,-0.4228,-1

gqm55n,SuggestALaptop,I would say that the Lenovo ThinkPad P53 is best for you. Built like a tank and has powerful hardware however the replacement for it is coming out in July. Might be worth waiting for more performance.,0.0,0.731,0.269,0.886,1
gqq8w6,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper and more secure.

gqq8md,SuggestALaptop,Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. This is the 13 I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games.

gqpfnh,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of the following The lid is made from brushed metal it can be opened easily with one hand and the case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. The display part flexes easily and the keyboard bends a little if you are hard typer. It is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means you can't connect external monitors using the port. The ram is not upgradeable so what you buy is what you get major con if 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning you would need to use Fn keys to use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not the best option if you are used to mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes with Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and the buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and the matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light the laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not to the point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it can charge up to 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 to 9.5 hours.

gqqt94,SuggestALaptop,I would prefer the Zephyrus G15 it’s AMD Zyron which the Strix is Intel. There is many more reasons but I forgot as I was also having that same decisions to pick of these two early on before. The only thing I’m worry about is G15 fan noise and heats there is many cites that’s claimed to have solution on fixing it but I’m still being skeptical about it.,0.091,0.83,0.079,-0.2263,-1

gqqru7,SuggestALaptop,Your budget is a bit tight for a thin and light with a dedicated graphics but I found this in your budget with the new Ryzen 4000 chips. For your budget I recommend the Dell G5 SE It has a 3Ghz 6 core/12 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 4600H 8GB of RAM 2X4GB upgradable AMD Radeon RX 5600M basically a 2060. 256GB SSD 15.6 1080p screen 860 ,0.0,0.913,0.087,0.6428,1

For higher end then I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for the money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes with the New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port. Very good heat mangement in general but it is better for the GPU than it is for the CPU. Make sure to check out This Laptop Buying Guide post for best laptops ,0.01,0.835,0.155,0.9944,1

gqom0n,SuggestALaptop,You have a few options. The HP Spectre x360 15 has better specs and will cost a lot less.

gqqf6z,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this Lenovo Yoga 720 because it comes with everything you need 8th generation i5 quad core CPU 8GB of ram good SSD storage of 256GB for faster boot up and loading 13.3 inch Full HD IPS touch screen high build quality backlit keyboard supports pen and thunderbolt port. I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review so here it goes It has an IPS panel with very stable viewing angles. Therefore the screen content is legible from every position. Under the open sky the device can only be used when the sun does not shine too brightly and even then the reflective surface of the display can negatively impact the experience. Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles. It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate The body is sturdy and feels premium. also please check out this article about best 2 in laptops Due to the Virus a lot of laptops are being overpriced so make sure to check this list of overpriced laptops before you buy any laptop at the moment.,0.017,0.834,0.148,0.9898,1

I recommend the Eluktronics MAX-17 It comes with a 8-core i7 processor and RTX 2070 SUPER graphics which should be plenty powerful for those games. There is a second M.2 slot for more storage. It is only 4.7lbs which is what makes it a very special device. Additionally it has a massive 91Wh battery so it will last 6 hours for light use.,0.0,0.778,0.222,0.9579,1

Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need.

gqne7p,SuggestALaptop,Since you asked about photo editing and video editing ignore the advice to get a gaming laptop. Those are NOT designed for photo editing. You want a laptop with decent thermals for sure but mostly you want a high-resolution color-accurate display that supports 100% Adobe SRGB and DP3 color space. Most gaming laptops are 1080p or 1440p at best and are not designed for color accuracy at all. They are designed for very fast refresh rates which are useless for photo and video editing. The Apple MacBook Pro line the HP Z line the HP Spectre x360 with OLED screen and the higher-end Dell XPS are all examples of laptops with a suitable screen for what you are trying to do. The MacBook Pro 13 is probably the only one available for under 1400 although the Spectre x360 OLED can be found under 1400 on sale. The MacBook Pro also has the T2 chip which dramatically accelerates video encoding and takes the load off the MacBook’s CPU. One alternative suggestion? iPad Pro 12.9 and the Apple Magic Keyboard and Pencil. This is a very good photo editing machine that can run Photoshop Procreate Adobe Fresco iMovie and others. iPad has an incredible high resolution bright LCD which suppports DP3 color gamut. Apple pencil is hands down the best drawing and stylus input available. And the Magic Keyboard makes iPad a real candidate for laptop replacement.,0.022,0.87,0.109,0.9712,1

gqmj7s,SuggestALaptop,This laptop is made especially for what you want but it's a bit more expensive but I think you should take a look as there is a slightly cheaper variant coming. This is probably the only small laptop with powerful specs that's worth the money right now. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-11 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a professional environment.

Here are some reviews to help you ,0.0,0.902,0.098,0.9253,1
gqmj7s,SuggestALaptop,For the lower end of your budget I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of the following The lid is made from brushed metal it can be opened easily with one hand and the case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. The display part flexes easily and the keyboard bends a little if you are hard typer. It is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means you can't connect external monitors using the port. The ram is not upgradeable so what you buy is what you get major con if 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning you would need to use Fn keys to use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not the best option if you are used to mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes with Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and the buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and the matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light the laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not to the point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it can charge up to 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 to 9.5 hours.

It's a well-built workstation with great thermals and pretty much the industry standard. Get it with 3 years of ProSupport Plus and you're set with next-business day on-site warranty and accidental damage protection. That said I'm guessing you have access to physical and virtual labs along with other computing infrastructure at school? If so you might want to look into getting an ultrabook instead. And finally To me a 5000 laptop that lasts 5 years is better than a 2500 laptop that lasts 2.5 years. Just trying to find that laptop.

gqn0d7,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this Lenovo Yoga 730 because it comes with everything you need 8th generation i7 quad core CPU 16GB of ram good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15.6 inch 4K UHD IPS touch screen high build quality backlit keyboard supports pen and thunderbolt port. I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review so here it goes It’s equipped with Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. The processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of the best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it’s not the best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops and it will run your games smoothly. Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles. It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

gqpst6,SuggestALaptop,Depends on how badly you need a laptop right now. There is always a better faster CPU around the corner.... Having said that the Lenovo c940 is a good 2-in-1 as is the HP Spectre x360. If you want to stick with a 2-in-1 the new HP Envy with the AMD Ryzen 4 is a very interesting choice and an excellent value.,0.075,0.692,0.233,0.8748,1
gqpst6,SuggestALaptop,There are a few with Ryzen 4000 out so far.

gqihti,SuggestALaptop,Man that's a tough one. It really comes down to what is the most important to you gaming or productivity? The i7 will obviously run much better with programs like fusion due to it's faster speed and more cores but the i5 laptop will pump out more consistent and higher FPS on the games you want to play. For example both GPUs will definitely pump out 100 FPS on average for CS GO on low settings but the 1650 will do it at higher settings as well. The 1650 also has better lows which means you won't get as much frame dip jutter. Games like CS GO don't need a powerful CPU to get the most frames since it's an old game but obviously a decent GPU is needed for high FPS. Now for GTA 5 you definitely want the 1650. The 1050 will play it but you'll likely have to have the settings at somewhere between low/medium to get a 60FPS average while the 1650 could probably do it at a mix of medium/high.,0.047,0.792,0.161,0.9643,1

gqibpz,SuggestALaptop,If not heavy gaming absolutely the Ryzen 4500U with 16GB of RAM. The Intel does have 6 cores but it uses more power than AMD's 6 cores and the 8GB of RAM is bad. Intel does have a pretty decent video card if you want to game but it's going to make the laptop chunkier to cool it. Ryzen has a very capable integrated graphics chip which can place alot of popular titles at 1080p. The 6 Ryzen cores and 16GB of RAM to be honest is a better buy.,0.045,0.722,0.233,0.9627,1

gqibpz,SuggestALaptop,The y540 is a entry level gaming laptop. Meaning it’s stronger but heavier and less versatile. The lenovo flex is a 2in1.

gqir5k,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of the following The lid is made from brushed metal it can be opened easily with one hand and the case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. The display part flexes easily and the keyboard bends a little if you are hard typer. It is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means you can't connect external monitors using the port. The ram is not upgradeable so what you buy is what you get major con if 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning you would need to use Fn keys to use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not the best option if you are used to mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes with Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and the buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and the matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light the laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not to the point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it can charge up to 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 to 9.5 hours.

gqias8,SuggestALaptop,I would stay far away from the 2017 MacBook Air. That is just way outdated spec-wise for the price. The 700 Surface Pro 7 at Best Buy is the one with the i3 and 4GB of ram yes? If so stay away. The i3 is a fairly slow CPU but its the 4GB of ram that just isn’t enough in 2020. For 100 more you get the i5/8/128 but the 128 is going to get tight really fast. You should really look for these minimum specs in 2020 4 core CPUn 10th gen Intel or AMD Ryzen 4000 8GB of ram 256 GB SSD storage 1080p or higher screen For 999 student discount you can get the 2020 MacBook Air with i5 10th gen 8/256 which is a much better laptop and will handle the needs you outlined. Unless you need a Mac though you may want to consider a Windows 10 PC which will get you mostly better hardware at the price point.

gqgae2,SuggestALaptop,If you can wait then I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for the money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes with the New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

gqcfcw,SuggestALaptop,If are in a hurry to buy one have a look at this But.. I strongly recommend u to wait a couple of months as asus is gonna release their refreshed zephyrus laptops with the new ryzen 4000 series processors which are delayed due to pandemic. It's worth the wait as they are too powerful for a laptop of this size.,0.031,0.817,0.152,0.7506,1
gqcfcw,SuggestALaptop,Found this at 76k you might wanna check this out. From what I've heard the battery life is not the best on this machine.

gqcfcw,SuggestALaptop,With your budget I would look into Acer Aspire series. They have dedicated graphics card. For instance NVIDIA Mx250 and NVIDIA gtx 1650 ti. You should do more research about this graphic cards and find out if they will meet your needs. I don’t do ML or DL so I can’t answer the above question. Sorry.,0.024,0.922,0.054,0.4019,1
gqcfcw,SuggestALaptop,Been there. Acer Nitro series will serve you well for all your needs. You can spend the remaining sum to buy extra SSD and RAM with the amount of data you'll be feeding your models this is going to be super important Having said that your best buddy is still going to be a desktop. An open cabinet CPU by my desk side has served me well for over 2 years. Edit Here take a look.,0.0,0.828,0.172,0.9201,1
gqeuge,SuggestALaptop,Hey Please keep in mind that low-budget laptops usually do not have the best build quality or reliability. They are not bad machines just that you should not expect them to last very long. With that in mind if you can push your budget to 450 this could be a solid option Lenovo Ideapad 3-14 It has a quad-core Ryzen processor Full HD LED IPS display SSD and room for an HDD 1 memory slot socketed and 1 soldered over 8H battery life a decent peripheral port selection 2 X USB 3.1 1 X USB 2.0 SD card reader and a Chiclet keyboard. I guarantee this one will not slow down in a couple of months.

gqeuge,SuggestALaptop,Unfortunately budget PCs don’t start out fast and only get slower as you add more and more to them. I’m afraid if you spend 400 now in six months you might be back here questioning what laptop to buy next. Have you considered a Chromebook? You can get a decent Chromebook for 400 and it won’t slow over time. It should be capable doing of virtually everything you listed. ChromeOS does have some limitations though so you may want to look into that before you start.,0.043,0.909,0.047,0.0935,1
gqeuge,SuggestALaptop,Quality really starts to drop off once you go under a certain price but this might do it. Dual core AMD Ryzen 3 3200U 8GB RAM 256GB SSD 15 1080p screen ,0.056,0.893,0.051,-0.034,0
gqeuge,SuggestALaptop,1 Buy a business class laptop like a Thinkpad. They start with better build quality than consumer grade devices especially low-end consumer devices. A used/refurb unit will be in your price range and should have plenty of life left. 2 Install an SSD if it doesn't come with one. 8GB RAM if you truly leave lots of tabs open. Upgrading thinkpads is usually easy so don't be afraid to DIY. You can also repaste the CPU/GPU with high-quality thermal compound for better thermal performance. 3 Install Linux. No seriously. If you're just streaming Linux tends to use less RAM in the background and doesn't usually slow down with time like Windows installs can. Linux Mint MATE or Linux Mint XFCE will use under 1GB. Bonus Linux is free and works well on Thinkpads. 4 My Thinkpad with an HD4000 iGPU can handle 1080p YouTube video fine and while you could get something more powerful you won't necessarily need to. My thinkpad also drives a pair of older cheap over-ear studio headphones without needing a DAC/amp so Spotify should sound pretty good.,0.026,0.79,0.185,0.984,1
gqeuge,SuggestALaptop,Usually when a laptop slows down it’s because of what’s on it. Operating systems break down over time. But if it’s not being treated correctly it will slow down a lot faster. Budget laptops are not the way to go if you need speed. Maybe what you Already got could do if you reset it and look into ways to take care of the operating system for example not leaving it running all the time and keeping up with updates not filling the hard drive all the way make sure programs aren’t running the the background. Take it to a professional and ask their opinion also if you want something that doesn’t slow down quickly you will have good luck on getting a Ssd instead of a standard hard drive.,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.906,1

They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you wanted to play games.

It comes with a 4-core processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 IPS display. This combination should easily handle general use tasks.

gqg96v,SuggestALaptop,It depends on what you want the laptop for. The base 1.1 GHz speed is perfectly fine if you intend to use the laptop for general usage and don't have a ton of installed programs that will run in the background. I say this because laptops are generally designed to accommodate the TDP of the CPU and a a CPU with that low speed is generally placed on thin laptops. These laptops are generally meant to run quite and smooth so long as you use it for general stuff like school work office media web browsing and so on.

Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery .

People on best-buy have reviews for this laptop and they seem to be experiencing fan issues. Apparently the fan is very loud. HP Envy series have a very poor battery life although I can’t confirmed on this one yet.

The HP Envy actually fits in the same footprint at the Dell but is thicker. It feels very slightly heavier but is nice to use. The keys are wider and have good travel and the trackpad is good. I particularly like the hardware camera button and finger print sensor. It runs slick and responsive and the sound/speakers are miles better. As mentioned above biggest caveat is the screen which is dimmer. The screen is also FHD on envy Vs 4K but this doesn't make as significant a different as the brightness. You can crank up the brightness but I'd say the equivalent brightness at 50% on the Dell is about 70% on the Envy.

They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you wanted to play games.

You get better performance more cores better battery life better gaming better security and cheaper than the Intel counterparts. The iGPU in these chips are able to play many titles at 1080p medium. It's extremely capable for a integrated GPU more or less the performance of an entry level discrete graphics card. Don't buy and Intel chip with Intel's UHD iGPU. It's basically unusable for gaming.

Although in terms of pure gaming performance the Helios 300 is a very nice option very good thermal looks good maybe? nice build quality tick all of the boxes except for battery life the Omen 15 with 9th gen intel is also very good flawless imo very little reviews about it though or the Zephyrus M scar iii and strix G. Having said that i would recomend you to wait for a few months if possible as will have more ryzen options and intel 10th gen option.

gq4c10,SuggestALaptop,They look good but I have had a terrible experience with ASUS...sent back two ROG strix scar iii both with the same motherboard issue/s. Was a G531GW for reference. I have real doubts in the ‘build quality’ of ASUS gaming laptops. I know the 9750H CPU runs hot but on both of my laptops they were around 95-100 deg C under load and 60-70 idle. Undervolting by any amount made it more unstable than it already was. Could have done a bit more eg re-paste but spending 2k on a laptop it wasn’t a good experience.

gq4c10,SuggestALaptop,The g14 is a great machine and there is nothing else like it but keep in mind the 2060 maxq is underpowered compared to other 15 inch machines. If you want the portability go for the g14 if you want more power go with something bigger. You probably can get a 2070 for 1500. GS75 I think. Also note the g15 is also underpowered because of strange design choices by Asus.,0.052,0.873,0.075,0.1766,1

Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

gqjdbq,SuggestALaptop,Between those 2 I would go for the Lenovo. That version of the G5 is pretty big and heavy and has been known to be pretty bad with the thermals. Dell did just do a refresh with the G5 though with the new AMD CPU’s and an AMD graphics card that is a little better than the 1660ti. I would look into that over the G5 you’re looking at. Even then though I might suggest the Lenovo better build quality and looks more professional although the charging brick is huge,0.037,0.817,0.146,0.856,1

gqdvup,SuggestALaptop,Copying from another comment I just made for under 500 you got 2 great options either this off brand from walmart or This Lenovo Ideapad both offer very similar specs but personally I like the one from Walmart more because according to reviews the build quality is much better and it is also very light at 2.55 lbs iirc.,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.8641,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,It can’t run full version of Microsoft Office application like Word Excel PowerPoint. That’s a major disadvantage I can think of. If your sole purpose is note taking I would agree iPad and the Apple stylus are very superior and their screens are very good too.,0.051,0.675,0.274,0.9039,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,I work for a fortune 500 company and alot of my executives wanted to get tablets as real computer replacements. They came back crawling after 1 week to traditional laptops. iPad is nice and is being used alot more but despite what Apple marketing tells you it is not a substitute for a really full fledged Mac or PC. Especially when you are paying the same price or even more than you could just buy a high end windows or low end Mac. With tablets you are at the mercy of apple for apps Your whole class uses a program not available on the apple store? You're screwed. I just don't see the need to limit yourself for the same price especially when the iPad with it's keyboard is now heavier and thicker than a regular laptop.,0.051,0.911,0.038,-0.4215,-1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,Watch this ,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,No. If you had a desktop or a laptop iPad would make great secondary device but as the only device I wouldn't recommend it. I agree with you that touchscreen with pen support are pretty good for note taking. That's why i personally got a windows laptop which was capable of doing that. I don't know which courses you would have in your college but in my masters we had a couple of subjects which involved coding and there is absolutely no way of doing that on iPad.,0.103,0.718,0.179,0.8584,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,I have been thinking of using that setup while travelling but I feel it is a little expensive it cost almost as good as this ASUS Zenbook which costs almost as much.,0.0,0.891,0.109,0.5319,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,Before the Magic Keyboard I would have said “absolutely no way.” But the Magic Keyboard is transformative. I’m using one now on the 2018 iPad Pro to write this post. Incredible. Even so I’m going to say “maybe.” You didn’t list what your course of study is so that will have an impact on the answer to your question. But generally you’ll need to be sure that 1. There are no applications you will need that are either not available on iPad or very limited on iPad. For example yes Excel is available on iPad but it is not capable of opening more complex spreadsheets every iPadOS version gets closer but it won’t match the desktop versions for years if ever . Photoshop on iPad is also not as capable as desktop version. Etc. etc. 2. You can live with iPad multitasking which is really just 2-app-tasking with some app switching. This is also improving but iPad just doesn’t do more than a couple of tasks at once very well if at all. You could get frustrated if you are trying to participate in a Zoom lecture take notes and do research at the same time. 3. You don’t want an external monitor. Many college students get a cheap external LCD monitor for their apartment or dorm to come home and write papers and do research on while using a large screen. Almost any LCD tv can also act as an external monitor and do double duty that way. IPad can only mirror its screen not extend its screen so you’ll just end up looking at a copy of what’s on your iPad screen. Again this could change with future iPadOS releases but now it is an issue. Now as to the Good 1. Magic keyboard and trackpad is a game changer. It might actually be worth the price 2. With Apple Pencil the iPad becomes an excellent maybe the best digital note taker 3. Pull iPad off the keyboard and you have an excellent tablet for reading eBooks watching videos playing games etc. 4. iPadOS files app now gives iPad a legitimate file manager which works well with local files and cloud storage 5. Apple has done an excellent job of supporting iPads over time so you should expect a new 2020 iPad to get 5 years of OS updates 6. The LIDAR scanner in the new iPad Pros could be put to some really cool uses in the future 7. IPad will be a delight to carry around to class and back given its size and weight 8. IPad has plenty of CPU power so you won’t be lacking in that area. It is actually faster than the MacBook Air. 9. IPad applications are becoming more and more capable all the time and so in the future you should expect more and more equivalency to the desktop versions If I could afford an iPad Pro 12.9 Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard or the MacBook Air 16/512 that would be a tough choice. Worst case get the iPad setup and see if it works. If it doesn’t get yourself a cheap PC laptop for 500 later and use it for whatever the iPad won’t do.,0.046,0.852,0.101,0.9881,1
gqdfkb,SuggestALaptop,Yes. You should absolutely do this. The iPad Pro is essentially made for productivity. The iOS store has so many cool note-taking apps too. Google Paperlike - it's a screen protector that feels like paper when you write on it with the Apple Pencil. If you like to take written notes this is a game changer. If you like to draw it's a game changer. The 2020 iPad pro is extremely powerful - the newest chip is an 8 core processor - I have seen people editing 4k video with scrubbing and on it. I am not even an giant Apple fan I only have an iPhone and Airpods but really think the pro is a perfect device for a college kid and even post-college. Magic keyboard is also clutch.,0.0,0.862,0.138,0.9279,1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,I honestly believe that the surface pro 7 is very overpriced especially if you start buying the accessories. If money is no problem for you go for it!,0.166,0.737,0.096,-0.2942,-1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,I recommend Lenovo Yoga C740 14 inch. You’ll get so much more for your money. The stylus that come with it may be inferior to the one with Microsoft pro 7 but you’ll be spending 100 buck on the stylus anyway so you can always buy a better one for your Yoga.,0.035,0.861,0.105,0.5789,1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,I think the Surface Pro 7 is an excellent choice. There are decent sales and Costco usually offers the SP7 keyboard and pen for 1000. Put an Urban Armor Gear case on that thing and you’ll have a backpack-friendly tough little tablet and laptop. The biggest challenge may be the kickstand design takes up a lot of table space and may not work well on small writing desk in lecture halls. For taking notes though the Surface Pro is great. The other alternative is 2-in-1 style laptop like the HP Envy or HP Spectre x360. The 2-in-1s are better laptops and worse tablets than the Surface. I find for note taking with pen the thickness of the 2-in-1s is less than ideal and I personally don’t like the weight of them as a tablet nor do I like feeling the keyboard and trackpad on the bottom when the screen is folded over. On the Surface just pull off the type cover and you’ll have a more normal tablet. Cool trick on the surface pull off the type cover and reattach backwards so that it becomes the back of the surface. I saw that in a video and though “why don’t they make that more obvious?” Genius. You can likely get a bit more hardware for your money if you get something like the HP Envy but if you really want a tablet that can replace your laptop one that can be made durable for kicking around in a backpack and is great for note-taking then the SP7 is an excellent choice.,0.038,0.845,0.117,0.9696,1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,I would buy an iPad pro if you have the budget. I currently have a Surface Pro 5 with the highest configuration and it's great - however I think you get more out of an iPad. It is thin has an amazing display and super portable. It's even cheaper than a similar configured surface. My complaints with the Surface are that the alcantara keyboard will get torn and scratched if you carry it in a bag and it rubs against things. I have also had issues with the screen - if something gets stuck between the keyboard and screen in your bag somehow it will create screen burns quite easily. I really hated this. My girlfriend just bought the surface pro 7 decked out and has already developed 2 screen burns as well. The biggest game changer is this stuff called Paperlike - its a screen protector that makes your screen feel like youre writing on actual paper. This sounds like it's right up your alley. If you buy a new 12.9 ipad Pro with magic keyboard and apple pencil its about 1500 and I know the surface pro 7 is in that same range if not a bit more when it's highly configured. Also you don't have to buy the 350 dollar keyboard for the iPad - that takes the price down considerably.,0.05,0.845,0.104,0.9049,1
gqd6hx,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure we can find you a 2-in-1 device that is a good value on a low budget. The Lenovo Flex 5 14 is my recommendation. It comes with a 6-core Ryzen 5 processor 16 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 IPS display. This combination should be just fine for the uses you listed. You can use Lenovo's stylus to draw on the screen. It is a much better value than the Surface Pro 7 in my eyes though it may not be as convenient to write notes on.,0.022,0.821,0.157,0.891,1

HP Envy 15 x360 can easily play sims 4 CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card.

gqe6y5,SuggestALaptop,I had a Zenbook before and did not like it - the screen felt like it had a green hue to it and it didn't feel as optimized for Windows as other competitors. This was a while ago so I'm sure that's changed a bit but just giving you a forewarning. If you're in that range I'd suggest the new XPS 15. The new screen is amazing and with a 16 10 ratio. The processor in the Zenbook is a Core i7-10510U and the Dell has a 9th Generation Intel Core™ i7-9750H - now you might be thinking why do I want a 9th gen over a 10th? well if you look at the last letter in each the Zenbook is a U vs the Dell which is an H. I'm not sure how much you know about processors but this is a huge difference. If you look them both up in CPU benchmark the 9th gen out performs the 10th by somewhat close to double.

gqe6y5,SuggestALaptop,How about this ASUS Zenbook because of the following The lid is made from brushed metal it can be opened easily with one hand and the case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. The display part flexes easily and the keyboard bends a little if you are hard typer. It is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means you can't connect external monitors using the port. The ram is not upgradeable so what you buy is what you get major con if 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning you would need to use Fn keys to use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not the best option if you are used to mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes with Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and the buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and the matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light the laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not to the point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it can charge up to 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 to 9.5 hours.

gqe26k,SuggestALaptop,The difference already been told but I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for the money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes with the New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port. Very good heat mangement in general but it is better for the GPU than it is for the CPU. Make sure to check out This Laptop Buying Guide post for best laptops ,0.006,0.835,0.159,0.992,1
gqdmtg,SuggestALaptop,I wouldn't if youre a digital artist. I do editing and photoshop a ton and display is extremely important. That computer only has a screen brightness of 250 nits which is on the low end compared to a lot of laptops on the market. Why not buy and iPad pro or the new Dell XPS line? Both have extremely nice displays and specs capable of what you're doing. Gaming laptops might be nice but they are not necessarily great for Digital art. If you want gaming and art then go with the new XPS. If you're budget is below 1000 I would get an iPad pro 2018 and forgo any gaming unless its like Fortnite or PubG .,0.05,0.835,0.115,0.6057,1

gqcxgs,SuggestALaptop,Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. This is the 15 I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 15 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it It has 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700U CPU with 16GB RAM 512B SSD 1080p IPS 100% sRGB Total should be 1000 flat. ,0.06,0.78,0.16,0.943,1
gqcxgs,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we can find you a powerful device. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 G401IA is my recommendation if you can work with a 14 display. It has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside GTX 1660 Ti MQ graphics which can handle your uses including some video editing. The Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has the offer for the price. The 74Wh battery should net around 6 hours for light use. It is only 1.6kg.,0.0,0.906,0.094,0.7717,1

gq5fd2,SuggestALaptop,Look at the Dell XPS 13 line they have some very powerful and super well built machines. An intel i5 8gb of ram and 512 gb of storage will cost u 1250 usd. The refurbished ones or last gen models are just as good and wil run for a lower price within your budget. The HP envy line also has some great options from 800- 1200 usd. They have intel i5’s or i7’s 8gb of ram and 512 gb of storage. My last recommendation is the Surface Laptop. The build quality on these machines is amazing and their screens are great as well. The storage is lacking however you could only fit 256 gb in your budget. There is a price premium for the Surface products but you get what you pay for. Stay away from the MacBook Air it’s way too expensive for the performance you get. Your money is much better spent on a windows machine because she isn’t using any Mac specific apps anyway I hope this helped stay safe and healthy!,0.025,0.798,0.178,0.981,1
gq5fd2,SuggestALaptop,I have been suggesting the iPad pro a lot. I think it is your best option. While you are subject to iPad iOS this is not a huge problem at all. People tend to think there is only one way of going about computer software - look at the iPad as an alternative to that which may even be better. Do not go with a Macbook Air - the new ones are just rehoused older technology sold at a premium price. The new iPad has a new 8 core chip and is extremely capable of doing what your sister needs - especially photo editing.,0.019,0.861,0.12,0.8831,1
gq5fd2,SuggestALaptop,I don’t know much about how prices are in Malaysia but in the USA for a 1200 budget you would have a lot of choices. You said your sister has a 2-in-1 but it doesn’t sound like she uses the touch screen or flip-around modes or pen much if at all . If true I’d suggest you stay away from the Surface line. Those are really designed for someone who wants a tablet-first experience and you’ll pay a lot for that design which may not be needed. They’re also lousy laptops meaning they are very hard to use in your lap. They are brilliant tablets though. Surface Pro 7 - good all around but by the time you price in the Type Cover and Pen you’re spending quite a bit for some fairly low specs . I owned a Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4 and loved them both but I like the form factor. Surface Pro X - very intriguing and more modern design but may not be available in Malaysia and has performance and compatibility questions Surface Go 2 - well made small tablet but underpowered especially for the price and really would only recommend for someone who values extreme portability Source I owned a Surface Go for a year and loved it but I wanted something very small Another 2-in-1 like the HP Envy would be a good choice. But you will run into the same sorts of quality issues you have now. Still you should get 3 years out of it. MacBook Air. Don’t let the people who only measure a computer by its Geekbench score put you off. The Air is a fine computer for MOST people. It has a bright Retina display vs. the dim 1080p displays on many value PCs it has completely fine performance with one exception it has impeccable build quality it has the T2 chip for security and additional performance it has Touch ID and will last for many years. It will also hold its value way better than a comparably priced PC. Where the Air is NOT fine is for CPU-intensive tasks that persist like video rendering. It is fine for quick cpu spikes like applying a photoshop filter or rendering a quick transition. But it has poor thermal headroom so anything that creates heat buildup will result in the CPU downclocking to stay cool. Most people don’t actually do these kinds of tasks and so never notice. Now the iPad Pro is an intriguing choice. I’m writing this post on the iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard and I can tell you the combination of iPadOS 13.4 and the Magic Keyboard is transformative. It is absolutely capable of replacing a laptop for many people. The question for yoyour sister is whether the iPadOS version of Word is featured enough for her work. If she is just doing general writing it will be fine. If she is doing complex layouts tables of contents extensive footnoting then it might not be capable of what she needs. The IPad does meet most of your requirements. Bright screen great for movies good speakers light weight long battery life. You can get one with 512gb of storage although you likely don’t need that much.,0.03,0.788,0.182,0.9983,1

The SurfaceBook 3 is much higher quality hardware but the eye-watering price should give anyone pause. You really have to want that detachable slate will you REALLY use it pretty badly. And for the price as the SurfaceBook 3 you can get an HP Spectre 15 with 4k screen and the same robust internals PLUS an iPad Pro which is a way better tablet than the detached lid of the SB3.,0.039,0.829,0.132,0.9158,1

gqbhvb,SuggestALaptop,Windows or Mac?? Ignite the flame war LOL A similarly priced PC will be much faster than the MacBook Air although the Air somewhat makes up for that with its Retina display which most value PCs struggle to match. Overall though I’d suggest the MacBook Air especially since you already have an iPhone 11 and Apple Watch. Apple bakes a lot of goodness into its ecosystem and you’ll be loving the Keychain password sync Handoff between phone and MacBook unlocking your MacBook just by wearing the Watch using Apple Pay across all 3 devices seeing your pictures seamlessly popping up on your MacBook syncing music playlists and of course the best one of all.....iMessage.

It's extremely capable for a integrated GPU more or less the performance of an entry level discrete graphics card. Don't buy and Intel chip with Intel's UHD iGPU. It's basically unusable for gaming.

gqb739,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of the following The lid is made from brushed metal it can be opened easily with one hand and the case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. The display part flexes easily and the keyboard bends a little if you are hard typer. It is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means you can't connect external monitors using the port. The ram is not upgradeable so what you buy is what you get major con if 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning you would need to use Fn keys to use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not the best option if you are used to mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes with Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and the buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and the matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light the laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not to the point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it can charge up to 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 to 9.5 hours.

I'd go with the 17 . ,0.046,0.891,0.063,0.3612,1

gq1p86,SuggestALaptop,Good Cooling Moving Lots of air Fast spinning fans Noise. If fans could be quieter they would be. Yes there are more premium designs out there that are slightly more efficient I'm speaking in general here not specifcially about AMD laptops but the cost tends to skews horribly so by and large you're stuck with X heat generation requiring Y noise in cooling to remove it some beefier laptops can maybe have thicker heatsinks so they don't have to ramp up as quickly but this is a temporary fix and under sustained load they're gonna be just as loud.,0.068,0.877,0.055,-0.5256,-1
gq1p86,SuggestALaptop,Are you referring to the G14 and G15 fan noise? They were able to fix some settings to bring down the temperatures 20C so they are cooler and more powerful than Intel at every segment right now. ,0.0,0.866,0.134,0.659,1

gq7i40,SuggestALaptop,Hi if you can work with a 14 display I would go with the Lenovo Yoga C740 This configuration comes with a 4-core i5-10210U processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 IPS display. The display has decent color gamut coverage which is ideal for your use case. It charges through USB-C.,0.039,0.897,0.064,0.3182,1
gq4rgv,SuggestALaptop,Programmer here who did physics in undergrad and proteomic in grad school so lots of bioinformatics work in R and python . Since you will be working with text a lot I suggest a laptop with as tall screen as possible. MacBook pro has 16 10 screen and so does the new xps13 and 15. There are plenty of configuration options and Dell like Apple cares about things that manufacturers like Lenovo don't bother with screen quality you'll be staring at it 10 hours a day - might as well make it bright with good contrast and colours speaker quality and touchpad. Lenovos have great keyboards that their uses swear by but I've used a Lenovo T470s xps15 and surface book and can't say any of the keyboards stood out in any way. They all worked. If you plan to do machine learning a laptop with Nvidia card is a must. Even weak laptop card will beat any cpu out there. The xps15 comes with a decent card. That being said for training of large networks you should use a dedicated GPU server.,0.027,0.87,0.103,0.877,1
gq4rgv,SuggestALaptop,Hi I think that you're going to need to spend more for what you're looking for. A durable and reliable device that is powerful enough for your uses will cost a lot. The T490 is likely not powerful enough since it caps at a 4-core ultrabook processor and the Legion Y545 is not very durable and reliable.,0.0,0.901,0.099,0.6808,1

gq2vbv,SuggestALaptop,Costco has one of the best return and warranty policies of the various sellers for their computer systems. 3 month return period just dont abuse it. 1 additional year of warranty.

gq7a56,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we can find you a durable and reliable laptop within budget. The Lenovo ThinkPad E495 is my recommendation. It comes with a 4-core processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 IPS display. This combination should easily handle general use tasks.

gq75hz,SuggestALaptop,For 40k options are a bit limited for really good screens tho. You could get older models cause some would have discounts.

gq24t6,SuggestALaptop,Hi I think that your best bet would be getting a base configuration of the Lenovo ThinkPad E595 This configuration comes with a Ryzen 5 processor 8 GB RAM and a 256 GB SSD. Then you can spend maybe another 200 for more RAM and more storage. You'll have a very competent configuration for much cheaper.,0.0,0.874,0.126,0.7778,1
gq24t6,SuggestALaptop,This isn't a ThinkPad but it's a premium laptop that is about double the Performance of all of those listed above. 10th gen Intel is basically obsolete die to AMD Ryzen 4000 series. Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to CPU- 2.3Ghz AMD Ryzen 5 4700U 8 cores in a thin and light RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card.

gq3y1p,SuggestALaptop,I suggest looking into the new Ryzen 4000 chips that just were released. They are a little bit harder to find but They offer better performance across the board than Intel chips and use less electricity. Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles if you wanted to game you have the option. I'll link this AMD Ryzen 3000 series for 449 which is a great price and available You get a brand new 4 Core 8 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 449 My second recommendation is this Ryzen 4000 laptop which will be absolutely better than the Ryzen 3000 mentioned above and has 6 cores vs 4 on the 3000. The only thing is that it goes out of stock pretty quickly but for the price? It's an absolute win if you can snag one. 6 core 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 4500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 479 This 4500u Lenovo is also a great deal at 492 if the second link is sold out NOTE this is a TN panel which don't tend to be the best in terms of color accuracy and viewing angles but should be fine for regular day to day use they are generally cheaper ,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.9909,1

gq1koj,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. For your 3D modeling you will need all the cores you can get. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer the leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen.

gpx5ez,SuggestALaptop,They are 2 different segments of laptops. They are both great options but if you want to LIGHTLY game and have a thin and light the x360 is definitely the winner. Here are some benchmarks of games that are playable on the 4700U. If you find these frame acceptable than go for the smaller formfactor of the x360 with it's little capable integrated GPU. The Dell is more of a dedicated gaming laptop as it weighs almost 5 pounds. It also has a very pretty powerful graphics card RX 5600M for high frame rate gaming. This is your choice if you want full blown gaming over portability The envy is your choice if you want a power regular use laptop with light gaming every now and then.,0.018,0.744,0.238,0.9851,1

Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

gq5j3m,SuggestALaptop,Pixelbook Go runs on ChromeOs - a dekstop/mobile os where you can't run your normal apps like on windows or macos. You can install android apps on it and lately it got support for running linux apps not sure what distro is based on but the whole process is overhwelming and i wouldn't consider this Chromebook for your work at all. Even as a Chromebook is very expensive the point of chromebooks is to be as cheap as possible and to have access to a browser now android apps but not to cost 600 . At that pricepoint you have to consider laptops with true desktop OSes. I'm a senior Cs student and a software dev wanna be. I'm familiar with web dev but you said that you're just starting out as a web dev. Maybe you know by now that not just software development but specifically web development is a very broad aspect has a lot of different technologies etc. Are you trying to become a backend dev? A front-ent? Backend and DevOps engineer? A full stack dev a.k.a software engineer usually frontend backend devops all together ? For all of these positions you don't need a laptop with a good gpu or dedicated gpu at all well depending on the project you're working on over 90% of the time you won't need a good gpu. Unfortunately you cannot install any IDEs frameworks etc directly on chromeos you have to do that through that linux-support alternative which isn't that good on this regard and also not every dev-related app or whatever has linux support. I just wanted to first clarify that there is no such thing as mAcOs iS sO mUcH bEtTer fOr sOftWaRe dEvElOpmEnT . That's not true at all. Depending on what you do as a software dev windows and gnlinux have advantages over macOs because of support. And vice versa macOs over the 2 f.e for ios app development. You can dual boot windows or gnlinux with macos but there is hardware compatibility issues and you won't get the full macOs app support also nvidia gpu driver support is officialy non existent since 2014 or something there are fan made driver support but that's not an issue since you won't need a dedicated gpu for you work at all as i mentioned earlier. Also don't trust people who say macOs' terminal is soo much better bcz macos is unix based and you can run commands on it and bla bla bla guess what? You have the equivalent terminal commands on window's cmd/powershell. Now that it has linux support you can write the same terminal commands as you would in a gnlinux distro. Also those macOs commands that most talk about those people usually just navigate through directories and brag about the terminal lol . I know it sound overhwelming but at least now you have necessery info about what you'll really need for your work. So you mentioned 2000Cad. For that price you can get a laptop with excellent build quality very good screen quality great batterylife and cpu performance for the most part while having a small body overall. Since weight is important for you a laptop with a screen under 15.6 diagonally might be ideal. If you want a 13.3-14 screen i wouldn't recommend the standard 16 9 ratio since for smaller screens 16 9 seems very short. More vertical space is highly appreciated for the work you're doing but we will get narrower display. F.E if we compare a 13.3 16 9 screen and a 13.3 16 10 screen macbook pro 13's or xps 13 9300's that 16 10 screen is bigger even though diagonally they're the same in area that 16 10 is a bit bigger but it is narrower horizontaly but taller vertically. There are also 3 2 screens which are even taller but more narrow f.e Surface Laptop 3 either 13 which is 13.5 diagonally or the 15 Surface Book 3 13/15 Huawei Matebook X Pro a new Acer 13 that just got released etc although there aren't a lot of 3 2 screen laptops on the market. On to cpus at least a quadcore cpu is necessery. Intel's 10 gen either comet lake or ice lake are the most common for that 2000cad price. An Ice Lake i5 is very similar in performance to an Ice Lake i7 search on google for these similarities so getting an i7 is not necessary. On the other hand a comet lake i5 i5 10210U is a quadcore cpu and an i7 10710U like on my Prestige 15 in a 6 core/12 thread cpu which works around 80-100% better than that i5 depending on how laptop manufacturers configure those cpus. Just because there is a U at the end of the cpu instead of an H doesn't mean that the U series cpu is weaker than the H series. Msi configured that 10710u to perform to its limits so its performance is the same as an i7 9750H that you would find in a Macbook Pro 16 i can confirm this . Unfortunately that i7 10710u doesn't perform the same on smaller laptops like it does in my Prestige 15 because of the cooling f.E in a last gen Dell Xps 13 9380 and Lenovo X1 Carbon 7th gen i guess the 10710u performs around 20% worse. Anyway there are the new Amd ryzen 4th gen mobile cpus that perform better than all intel cpus for a lower price. Also they perform better while pulling less wattage or the same depending on the cpu . Because the work you will do doesn't cause any issues from the cpu amd cpus don't work well with android studio it will throw a bsod when trying to run android studio's emulator that's my experience since i work with it . The problem is that there aren't any laptops with a 16 10 or 3 2 display and a ryzen 4th gen cpu. There is a 13.3 Hp envy with a 4th gen ryzen cpu which is overall very great for its price but is has a 16 9 screen which i don't recommend to anyone who need a 13-14 display. There is a gaming laptop - a 14 16 9 Asus rog g14 with ryzen 4th gen that for 2000 cad has the best mobile cpu in any laptop at the moment and is overall the best performing laptop for its category its batterylife is quite long for a gaming laptop but the problem is that it is a bit too heavy for you maybe it looks like a gaming laptop although overall muted 16 9 screen it has a dgpu which tou won't need. What it would highly suggest you is either one of these laptops This Dell Xps 13 9300 config you should get a matte screen protector for it search amazon or this config which already comes with a matte screen but it isn't touchscreen. I know that the first config is slightly above your budget but at this pricepoint it is worth considering. This config of the 2020 base MacBook Pro 13 with a quadcore i5 and 16gb of ram is very good. I wouldn't recommend 8gb of ram anymore you'll end up having opened a couple of apps tabs on browser which will use a big protion of your ram. Also if you endup getting this please consider buying a matte screenprotector Apple advertises their screens as anti reflective and while they have a layer on top they are still glossy and very distractive when you're working in a brightly lit environment. Dell also has an anriglare layer on that first config xps 13 above. Surface Laptop 3 13 is also very nice with an i5 10th gen and 16gb ram you're getting a very nice laptop overall. That Hp Envy x360 with ryzen 4th gen is also prerty good we have to wait for proper reviews to see how it performs how's batterylife screen quality etc.,0.04,0.834,0.125,0.9991,1
gq5j3m,SuggestALaptop,Hi I can't give much advice about web development but I can definitely say that the Pixelbook Go isn't the most cost effective option. Instead I'd go with the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon The 1 895.67 CAD configuration comes with a 4-core i5 processor 16 GB RAM and a 1080p 14 IPS display which should be fine for general use and web development. The weight is only 2.4lbs. Since it is a business grade laptop it is a very durable and reliable device.,0.0,0.876,0.124,0.8838,1
gq2fek,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper and more secure.

gq1uzj,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we can find you a powerful gaming laptop. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus G15 has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside RTX 2060 MQ graphics which can easily handle modern games at high-ultra settings 1080p.

gq1mlt,SuggestALaptop,It depends on what you prioritize. If you are carrying the laptop everywhere and using it on small desks like those found in lecture hall classrooms you may find the 15 is just too big. In that case the smaller size of the 13 can be a real delight to carry. On the other hand if you mostly use the laptop at home you will probably appreciate the extra screen size of the 15 and most 15 have a numeric keypad which may also be quite a plus for accounting work. You will just have to decide which use case matches your needs.,0.0,0.886,0.114,0.9062,1

gq1mlt,SuggestALaptop,The XPS Is a good laptop but is severely overpriced for what you get with performance. They tend to have a 4 core CPU and I can recommend something with double the cores at 8 and a cheaper price. I'll link the 15 and then the 13 Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 15 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to CPU- 2.3Ghz AMD Ryzen 5 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible 1089 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not to skimp on the screen and wifi on any of these configs. Trust me. ,0.07,0.786,0.144,0.9624,1

gpicnk,SuggestALaptop,I've seen ASUS mentioned a lot here. For my two cents while it's not the most obnoxious model on their catalog I have the GA502 and it's kind of a hot potato. The Mothership might be better but after dealing with their horrible 'Armoury Crate' software the awful cooling system in the GA502 and the genuinely dismissive and decidedly unhelpful support system the company has I wouldn't go ASUS. Their motherboards for desktops are pretty great and their laptops used to be incredible but it just doesn't feel that way anymore. The Alienware M15 R3 just launched and it has a neat vapor chamber cooling system that supposedly improves thermals by a significant margin. Reviews aren't out yet though so we'll see if that hold true. The Area 51M is just a beast and absolutely fits the 'Onnoxious' criteria though I'm not sure about thermals which should be among the most important things you look for when you select a PC. Outside of Dell's swanky Alienware series MSI has some neat designs and Razer Blade has some slightly subdued aesthetic language but looks and feels just as gamer-y as you would hope.

gq0q2o,SuggestALaptop,The AMD Ryzen 4000 is a faster multi-core chip series than Intel 10th gen but both are very speedy. Make sure when you do the comparison you are comparing apples to apples. Don't compare a 15-watt Intel U series or 9 watt Intel Y series to a 45 watt AMD Hseries chip. The Surface Pro 7 is a very good Windows tablet that can truly replace a laptop. You asked 1 - how is Microsoft support? Awful. You can be running Microsoft Office on Microsoft Windows 10 on a Surface Pro and they'll treat you like you are running Linux on a Chromebook when you call. IF you happen to live near a Microsoft store though you can actually get great service in person. 2- Is there a Surface Pro 7 refresh coming? There always a new machine just around the corner. The 10th gen 17 with 16GB of RAM will be plenty fast and will last you for quite a few years. If you need the Surface now take advantage of the Memorial Day sale. If you can wait there will always be a bettefaster version coming in the future. For that price 1300 you might also check out the HP Spectre x360 2-in-1. It is less of a pure tablet than the surface but a whole lot better to use as a laptop. The HP also has a USB-A port and 2 Thunderbolt ports vs. the zero thunderbolt ports on the Surface Pro. The HP comes with a case and pen wherease those will cost you another 200 for the Surface. The HP has Windows hello login via face detection AND fingerprint scanning.

gppw42,SuggestALaptop,The G14 is the first of its kind so it's bound to have few kinks for being a trailblazer at this size and performance. Has fixes for the fan and heat issue. Asus will definitely assess this in an update as it's literally just a small setting change. Also update the bios to the latest bios to make sure you are stable. Personally I saw some of the reviews and saw some of the issues and they seem to just be software related aside from the keyboard backlight which just sucks. These cons are going to be very temporary as this is brand new and users have already fixed the issues. The hardware is fine and it seems to be things updates will fix. The pros outweigh the cons in my opinion and the cons are just software related which happens even on apple devices that are typically extremely stable so I don't even really see it as a con. But it's up to you! My friend bought one and it worked fine right our the box with no issues. So it really is all a gamble but I think it's a pretty safe gamble that's worth it.,0.016,0.856,0.128,0.9577,1

gppw42,SuggestALaptop,Hey Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 GA401 is pretty new on the market and it has some issues - it's true some of them have been fixed but some not. From what I understand the fan problem was fixed with a bios update but there are other issues with this laptop - like it can't function with the lid closed a lot of users want to hook it up to a bigger display and use it with the lid closed - well it ends with a black screen. I'm not going to list the qualities of this laptop everybody knows them but I'm going to list some drawbacks limited upgrade options and display with a big response time. Plus some users have complained about the temperatures. Here you can get a lot of feedback Only users that have this laptop or want this laptop post there. From what I've seen - some of them have been returned for quality control issues but it's a new model this kind of thing happens. Hope I helped!,0.053,0.841,0.106,0.7463,1
gppw42,SuggestALaptop,For the screen size I don't think so but if you are ok with a little bigger but still have lightweight then I would recommend this Eluktronics MAG-15 Slim because of the following It comes with GTX 1660Ti GPU and it will run the mentioned games on medium to high settings You can check the below link to see how the GTX 1660Ti GPU scroll down for the FPs and settings expected or ctrl f then type the name of your game . it has a professional look like you want. Developed by intel with corporation with different laptop brands. According to Dave2D it has great battery life up to 7 hours with regular usage . Very light for a gaming laptop at 4.15 lbs like you want built with Magnesium alloyed all over The speaker gril is in the bottom of the laptop 3 USB A Thunderbolt 3 SD card reader and HDMI port. Easily upgradeable removing the back panel gives you access to 2 ram slots that can support up to 64GB ram the Wifi card if you want to change 2 NVMe cards and one of the biggest battery capacity at 93W/H. Screen is 144 HZ IPS with high color accuracy 96% RGP and 73% sRGB with up to 290 nt brightness. Bezels are pretty thin camera is up top. Keyboard is mechanical but it needs time to get used to it. Heat management is great and it comes undervolted so you can play with that if you need more CPU power.

They buy chips graphic cards and all other computer components and put them together for you and that is what allows them to sell it pretty cheaply. They have gained the trust of alot of people and people love them because if the endless customization options.

gq0ar6,SuggestALaptop,Some users hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 13 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light with 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and make sure to get the Intel wifi 6 card. 100% sRGB 1080p IPS Panel.

gpxz71,SuggestALaptop,MATLAB isn’t demanding. The computer science specs should suffice. Honestly for CAD I would not bother to go for a laptop. Why? Most of the laptops would run very hot and have cooling issues so you would have to connect it to a external monitor. This immediately defeats the purpose of a laptop. You have a very healthy budget. I say invest in a PC if you want to play along with CAD at home and really want to get involved. If you really want a laptop I would recommend Lenovo ThinkPad P1 2nd generation specifically designed for engineers and HP ZBook studio that have powerful NVIDIA Quadro graphics such as P2000.

gpz5sh,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They are absolutely stomping the entire Intel lineup right now in the CPU space. If you need CPU horsepower for streaming or video editing and rendering it's a no-brainer. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper and more secure. I recommend the ASUS A17 It has the new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips. 2.9Ghz 8 core 16 thread AMD Ryzen 7 4800H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD GTX 1660Ti or 2060 999 ,0.0,0.94,0.06,0.6674,1
gpz5sh,SuggestALaptop,The build quality on that is not the best I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for the money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes with the New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

gpylxg,SuggestALaptop,I would suggest looking into the new AMD Ryzen 4000 CPUs that just launched. They offer better performance and cheaper price and have a very capable little integrated graphics chip that mops the floor with Intel integrated graphics. They are also more secure and have better battery. You can lightly game with this laptop and use it for casual use. This is not a gamer machine but can do most esports titles at 1080p medium.

gpxs49,SuggestALaptop,Intel used to be better but was in the lead for so long they got lazy and got leapped frogged by AMD who was almost bankrupt and needed to innovate its way out of it. They took a gamble on their Ryzen chips in 2016 and the 7nm process node last year and they have been killing Intel across the desktop workstation server and now finally laptops with their Ryzen 4000 series. The reason is they are using TSMC'S 7nm process and chiplets design for it's CPU basically they can glue chips together to make higher skus. They are all the same just with glued cores. Intel is still on 14nm because they design their own chips and saw no need to push innovation as they were ahead so much. So now they have been at 14nm since 2014. And they still can't just shrink their node because of their monolithic design to their chips and issues with trying to shrink down to 10nm. Basically Intel will be behind till at least 2023 and by then AMD will be on 5nm. Long story short AMD is the better option. Cheaper more performance more cores better battery more secure. intel is popular and they are a massive company so it's gonna take time for people to really see how ahead AMD is. For video editors the majority use AMD now because of the high core count CPUs they offer for fairly cheap 3900x is a 12 core CPU for 389 They even offer a 64 core monster if you can afford a 4000 chip.

gpxqgc,SuggestALaptop,You need a desktop with a high core count CPU and tons of RAM OR clean up your workflow. Use bookmarks and close tabs. Any computer regardless of specs will choke if you are just running a million things at the same time for no reason.,0.118,0.826,0.056,-0.4588,-1
gpxqgc,SuggestALaptop,Really? You cannot physically do all of those things at the same time but as Chewy said get a desktop. One with 32GB of ram a 16 core XEON cpu and dual 4k monitors. Shouldn’t cost you more than about 5000 or so. But if you really want to TRY and do all of that at the same time you will most likely be RAM-bound more than CPU or Storage limited. So find a machine that allows 32GB of ram. If you really are running all that stuff you’ll want a 4k monitor of at least 15.6 inches or larger. You will also want at least an 8 core CPU. There aren’t a lot of laptops that support 32GB of ram but on the list would be MacBook Pro 16 HP Z line HP Spectre x360 15 Dell XPS Dell Inspiron But if you can tighten up your workflow a bit any high-end laptop with gobs of ram will work.,0.015,0.927,0.058,0.7067,1

The processor will handle all of your cpu intensive programs that you use with ease with its 6 cores and high boost clock. It has a GTX 1050 which is an older graphics card but it is more powerful than other laptop graphics cards like the MX150/250. This graphics card will handle any games you play but you might have to turn down some settings on more newer demanding games. It has 8gb of ram which is not a lot but you could always upgrade to 16gb.

gpr8hz,SuggestALaptop,Hi I don't have much advice when it comes to the experience of using a 2-in-1 but I can definitely recommend you a decent 2-in-1 device. The Lenovo Flex 5 14 just came out and it is shaping to be an excellent value. It comes with a 6-core Ryzen 5 processor 16 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 IPS display.

gpr8hz,SuggestALaptop,I tried to do this myself and have used the Surface Pro and the HP Spectre x360. A few things to consider 1. You aren't just changing hardware you are changing entire ecosystems. Take stock of how many of Apple's ecosystem features you are using. I'm not just talking about iMessage although that one alone can be a deal-breaker for many people but Keychain Notes News iPhoto iMovie iCloud Drive ApplePay AppleTV etc. You can get close to reproducing this on Windows but it will be more of pain and you'll have to lean heavily on the Google cloud to help you. This applies to iPadOS apps that you might using which may not be available on Windows 10. 2. Decide if you want a tablet that can replace your laptop Surface Pro or a laptop that can replace your tablet 2-in-1 . 2-in-1s are great laptops that can act as a tablet in a pinch but they are 90% Laptop. even taking notes on one vs. the iPad will be a disappointment. Windows 10 is a very good desktop and laptop OS although you may be surprised how much time you spend tweaking it vs. what you are used to on the Mac that can do just about anything you need. The size and thickness make them cumbersome tablets and anything above 13 inches is pretty impossible to use as a tablet. The Surface is much more akin to a tablet that can replace a laptop. Windows 10 is not a great tablet OS so you may miss your iPad. However the Surface hardware is very nice as a tablet and you can generally use a surface like a tablet in a way you can't easily use a 2-in-1. The surface screen is smaller than virtually all 2-in-1s and using a Surface on a lap is an exercise in futility. You could also consider selling the Air and getting the Apple Magic Keyboard for your iPad Pro. yes it is expensive but it absolutely makes the iPad much more viable as a laptop replacement. x200B For 2-in-1s I generally suggest HP Envy Chewy will tell you all about this HP Spectre x360 Lenovo Yoga C740 cheaper or Lenovo c940 more expensive For Surface I suggest Surface Pro 7 Costco has a great bundle usually which includes keyboard pen The Surface Pro X looks great but you are taking a big gamble with that ARM processor and why risk adding a bunch of compatibility issues just for thinner bezels?,0.047,0.84,0.112,0.9867,1

gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,I would assume laptops with gpus tend to produce more heat and more heat leads to higher rates of failure. and thats what I think is probably the cause of all those Razer laptops with defects. Louis Rossmann once invited a repair guy specializing in Razer repairs to explain the internal designs. IRC the cooling system was generally not very good. combined with a thin chassis leads to a shorter life span I think those that are super thick and heavy such as those Clevo laptops probably last longer comparatively. this is just my guess,0.088,0.872,0.04,-0.5751,-1
gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,As with any product . More parts means more failure points. I'm not surprised about the toughbook. They are over engineered with the focus on being durable. So it would be fair to assume they would outlive most other models. But I'd assume as a whole the integrated systems are more prone to failure for the simple fact that most of the low end market and budget models are made as cheap as possible. I'd think it be more interesting to compair pricepoint with failure rate. On a purely anecdotal note I've bought and owned many laptops over the years with many brands Dell budget tier are the ones I've had the most trouble with. So much so I've tended to avoid them for the last 8 or so years so no idea how they are now. Also my longest lasting laptop was a core 2 based Sony Vaio I think the person that inherited it still used it up until last year. So almost 11 years .,0.13,0.84,0.03,-0.9509,-1
gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,Only the hardware makers know the actual failure rates and even then they would need an identical model where the primary difference is GPU/no-GPU. But anecdotally according to the ever-accurate Internet chat rooms laptops with dedicated graphics cards DO fail quite a bit more. It is very plausible for 3 related reasons 1. More heat overall as another heat-generating component is squashed into a small area 2. Users who buy these laptops tend to use them for more intensive sustained tasks leading to .... more heat 3. GPU makers overestimated their components abilities to deal with heat NVIDIA was famous for a run of GPUs failing Thin laptops and hot components are in conflict. Having ample airflow and big fans is not what most laptop buyers want - they want thin and quiet. Microsoft Surface Book is the rare exception with the CPU in the tablet lid and the GPU in the base which enabled both components to heat up independently and indeed it punches above its weight on sustained tasks vs most ultrabook-type devices as it can isolate each heat producing element in a different part of the device. I would guess big clunky gaming laptops would do better since they are designed to handle the heat HOWEVER gaming laptops fall into trap 2 above and run the heat-producing games for long periods of time under pretty heavy loads. Even more of a challenge is that the CPU and GPU in most laptops are quite close together often sharing the same heat pipe meaning heat from one can actually be quickly passed to the other.,0.059,0.874,0.067,0.0273,0
gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,I’m curious to hear what people say. lurk,0.178,0.594,0.228,0.128,1
gpnisk,SuggestALaptop,I dont think its a video card thing more than the product family. The gaming lines are always better build quality than the budget or mainstream lines. Normally a laptop with a separate GPU is better because it has the better battery motherboard power supply case hinges monitor panels and those are the biggest points of failure. IE HP Omen will fail less than the Envy which fail less than a Pavillion which will fail less than the HP no name family The fairest comparison I can make is the budget garbage Acer Aspire 5 family. You can get the same specs with a non-gaming/light gaming gpu like the MX250 or the same exact specs without the gpu for 75-100 less. I've gotten 3 with gpus. all 3 got fried mother boards in under 2 years. Meanwhile only a quarter of the non-gpu aspires have had major issues usually failed fan screen or power adaptor only the gpu version have had complete mobo power failures. but thats aspire 200- 600 slapdash disposable laptops. My oldest laptop Alienware Area 51 with an 8800m card from 2007-ish has almost no battery life but still runs perfectly but was almost 2000,0.092,0.834,0.073,-0.2067,-1

gppdxd,SuggestALaptop,Can confirm that the ENVY x360 15 with Ryzen 7 4700U is a beast. I work professionally with Blender with light gaming on the side with down time. Blender runs quite well handling over 9 million polys quite easily. The RAM SSD and Wifi are all upgradable. Though to be honest the RAM will be the only thing you would want to upgrade. I am currently on the hunt for a 32gb kit. But since the pandemic that is proving hard. The added touch screen and NTrig Pen Digitizer was a big selling point for me. A lot of my blender work these days is in sculpting. So not having to carry around my XP Pen 15.6 Pro Pen display with me to the office is nice. Note that you do have to buy a pen/stylus separately. But the Wacom Bamboo Ink V2 works really well and it's a third of the cost of a Apple Pencil. So big bonus. As for the 4700U in the ENVY. It's insane. 8 Physical cores... In a laptop... I don't even care that it doesn't have SMT/Hyper Threading. What I find nuts is that this low wattage ultrabook convertible laptop CPU renders blender scenes as fast as my Ryzen 3600 Desktop with 6 Cores/12 Threads. That blows my mind. But yeah. If you want something that is nice to look at with solid performance and that checks a lot of boxes. Then I can't recommend it enough.

This is the 13 I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it It has 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700U CPU with 16GB RAM 512B SSD 1080p IPS 100% sRGB Total should be around 1000 ,0.06,0.778,0.162,0.943,1
gpo99m,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper and more secure. For your budget I recommend the ASUS A15 This is a 2.9Ghz 8 core 16 thread AMD Ryzen 7 4800H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD GTX 1660Ti 999 ,0.0,0.908,0.092,0.6361,1
gpo99m,SuggestALaptop,It sounds like you really want a gaming laptop. One key item I strongly suggest for any student is to get a laptop with a Webcam. Something like this HP Omen on sale for 1299. However I have an alternate suggestion. Gaming desktop like this one for 599 Gaming monitor like this one for 219 iPad 128gb on sale right now for 100 off - 329 Apple Pencil - 90 student discount Urban Armor Gear iPad case 50 ------------------------------------------------------- Total price of this setup 1290 Here is why I suggest this route 1. Way more gaming value for the money with a Desktop and you don't need to worry about the heat-induced reliability issues gaming laptops struggle with 2. 24 monitor is way better for gaming than 15.6 especially for FPS 3. Gaming desktop can be upgraded down the road especially the video card 4. You get far more storage for your games vs. a laptop 5. Nice big monitor to write papers and do research when you aren't gaming 6. iPad will be a wonderful and light tablet to take to class and use for notes research and reading e-books. you will barely notice it in your backpack and if it gets lost or stolen you aren't out much money 7. Gaming laptop will be heavy thick and a pain to lug around all the time. And do you really want to give off the I'm a gamer vibe ALL the time at college? 8. Gaming laptop battery life is terrible iPad is incredible. And everywhere you go someone will have an iPad charger ready. best of both worlds. A great device for class and library and notes and a way better gaming experience than a laptop. You can sell your parents on the idea by explaining the value of not carrying a massively expensive MacBook Pro all over campus and instead saving money by getting a desktop for 'real work and having the iPad for notes and research.,0.041,0.828,0.132,0.9817,1

gptb77,SuggestALaptop,I think the best laptop for you is the Dell Inspiron 15 7000. Here is the link It is a 15 inch 1080p non-touch laptop but it has bezels like the XPS line so it is more compact than other 15 inch laptops. It has a 6 core i7 9750h that can boost up to 4.5ghz. The processor will handle all of your cpu intensive programs that you use with ease with its 6 cores and high boost clock. It has a GTX 1050 which is an older graphics card but it is more powerful than other laptop graphics cards like the MX150/250. This graphics card will handle any games you play but you might have to turn down some settings on more newer demanding games. It has 8gb of ram which is not a lot but you could always upgrade to 16gb. It has a 512gb nvme ssd so it can holds all of applications documents games photos videos etc. it has a 56whr battery which will get you decent battery life but if you do intensive tasks for long periods of time you probably will need to carry a charger around if you go somewhere.

gpsibi,SuggestALaptop,Hi I wouldn't expect much out of laptop speakers so you'll want to use headphones or earbuds. So I'd go with the new ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 when it comes back into stock. It has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside GTX 1660 Ti MQ graphics which can easily handle all of your uses. The Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has the offer for the price. The 74Wh battery should net around 6 hours for light use. It is only 3.5lbs.,0.0,0.923,0.077,0.6786,1
gpoywc,SuggestALaptop,Hi in this price range I'd go with the Acer Aspire 3 if you can work with a 15.6 display. You get a 2-core Ryzen 3 processor a lot stronger than a Pentium processor 4 GB RAM a 128 GB SSD and a 1080p 15.6 display.

gpm7wu,SuggestALaptop,I assume because it would have no warranty you mean you'd be buying it second hand from someone? In which case it depends on how much you're saving versus buying a new or certified refurb machine with a warranty and customer support.,0.05,0.816,0.134,0.5719,1

gpruxd,SuggestALaptop,Hi I think that the new Dell XPS 13 9300 would be a good choice for a device that is compatible with an eGPU. You get a 4-core i7-1065G7 processor 16 GB RAM 512 GB SSD and a FHD 13.4 IPS display. This combination alongside an eGPU should handle games very well.

gplz2q,SuggestALaptop,Your version should have the 4 heat pipes by default and out of the box should be as good as it gets thermal wise. Check this thread out ,0.0,0.806,0.194,0.7184,1
gplz2q,SuggestALaptop,Since you said you wanted to get hyped up I'll tell you about my experiences with my Dell XPS 13! To put it simply it's incredible don't have any affiliation with Dell in any way and have pretty neutral opinions about the company if you were wondering - The build quality is quite impressive as I was coming from a MacBook Air Early 2015 model and was expecting really poor build quality in comparison but the XPS holds up really nicely. - A more subtle feature of this laptop that people don't talk about or hype up enough is the carbon fiber palm rest. It's soft to the touch and honestly makes my typing experience so much more enjoyable in general. It's nice that Dell put in this much thought when they could have followed the trend that every other laptop was setting and just left us with a regular metal palm rest and no one would have ever complained. - Seeing as you're getting the XPS 15 and I have the 13 I imagine the power is going to be absolutely amazing on your device. For me and my purposes the my XPS has shown to be a power-house. It performs all the tasks I ask it to quickly and I've even been able to do light gaming on it even though I have an integrated graphics chip. - The thermals are pretty good on my machine. It only ever gets hot when I play some games on it Sims 4 and COD mainly which is expected since I don't have a discrete graphics chip. Even when it does get hot though it does so towards the back of the machine so it shouldn't ever be uncomfortable. People are right when they say it gets really hot but for the average person someone who doesn't game a whole lot or do much photo/video editing or CAD work it shouldn't get to those points on a regular basis. Dell does this to get maximum performance because by letting the machine hit a high temperature it's allowing for peak performance to happen for a longer time and then the laptop will thermal throttle and come down. - Now the part that you seem most hyped about -- the screen! I have the 4K version as well I have a 2-in-1 so the configuration I got forced me to get the 4K display and it's so good! I really enjoy watching YouTube videos and shows or movies on Netflix with this. It's such a game-changer because everything and I mean everything looks absolutely gorgeous on it. I even started to appreciate typing on Google Docs and just browsing websites more because the colors are so vivid and I don't know how to describe the display other than crisp. Everything just packs a little punch even the font on this post looks nice. I hope this helped hype you up and feel free to ask me any questions!,0.024,0.835,0.141,0.9965,1
gplts8,SuggestALaptop,I hate to be negative but I feel for a new system you'd need to be looking at something like a Dell G3 or Acer Nitro 5 both of which are a bit over budget.l,0.138,0.766,0.096,-0.1154,-1
gplts8,SuggestALaptop,At your budget you might be able to find a laptop with a Ryzen 5 4500U and 8GB RAM. That should be enough for your light gaming. The Ryzen 4500U is a solid CPU for all sorts of stuff but specifically it was pretty decent integrated Vega graphics for playing some light games. Vega is way better than Intel but nothing compared to an actually Nvidia GPU. However from what you described you don’t need very much GPU power just a few basic games. I’ll try and find something in you price range. EDIT actually based on this video you could even go for a Ryzen 3 4300U and 8GB RAM and still have enough performance for some light gaming. That would be more in your price range. But if you can find a 4500U laptop on sale that would be ideal. ,0.0,0.888,0.112,0.9455,1

gprcwc,SuggestALaptop,If you want to run multiple things at the same time you need RAM. Typically 8GB is acceptable for super light work. If you need more than 8 16GB is usually a great middle ground but it's a bit more expensive. I have a recommendation that is 1000 flat and it gives you 8 cores and 16GB RAM for opening tons of tabs if you are interested.,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.8537,1

gpo2xn,SuggestALaptop,A dedicated GPU depending on the model will provide more horsepower and power depending on the programs that you need to run. For a example if you need Adobe Illustrator their hardware requirements are 1GB VRAM minimum 4 GB recommended. Please list the whole pile of programs that you need to run. Take that list and run it through a blender and fuse those requirements into what you need. ,0.0,0.897,0.103,0.7269,1
gpo2xn,SuggestALaptop,My two cents If you're not going to do video editing gaming or professional level photoshop editing I'm talking proper editing not creating logos or something basic like that then you won't need a dedicated graphics card But wait for more suggestions I'm no expert.,0.138,0.811,0.051,-0.5158,-1
gpo2xn,SuggestALaptop,No that's not what it's about. A graphics card contains a GPU graphical processing unit which is a processor that is specialized in doing calculations that graphical applications such as games need. It can be also useful for other purposes and can accelerate other things because a GPU is well suited for carrying out the same instructions over a large data set in parallel. The graphics card has its own memory because it makes the system faster if there is memory that the GPU can directly access and exclusively use. If you don't have a dedicated graphics card that means that you have to make do with the processing power of the integrated graphics inside your CPU. You can put as much memory in the system as you like but it will still lack the processing power of the dedicated graphics card. Depending on what kind of applications you run this might be just fine for your use case.,0.059,0.895,0.046,-0.4696,-1

gpjxst,SuggestALaptop,The Dell g15 is a 15.5 inch laptop and it's pretty chunky. It has a 4800H and a 5600M which is about a 2060 The G14 is extremely popular because it's thin and powerful as heck. Also the battery is like 10 hours. My friend uses an external webcam or his phone as a webcam with software so it's not an issue for it. I recommend the G14 because of the size. The G5 is great but it's BIG,0.0,0.823,0.177,0.8806,1
gpjxst,SuggestALaptop,G5 is good but radeon has a history of slow adaptation.. so expect more bugs and trouble for initial adapter 5600M . G14 is somehow overpriced as it is the sole crown holder for its class the camera is somewhat forgiving as there is a newly develop application that can link the phone camera to laptop the deal breaker for me is the lack of lan port need additional USB dongles and 23 ms screen delay. G15 is the best on its class but somewhat being held back by its bad review due to thermals. But this can be eliminated by doing some simple research many solutions of your own liking can be found in reddit . For me pick the G15,0.104,0.777,0.119,0.288,1

gpk1sf,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure we can find you a low budget laptop that can run some light games. I recommend the Acer Swift 3 It comes with a 4-core i7 processor and MX150 graphics which should be just fine for general use as well as light gaming.

gpfoh6,SuggestALaptop,I ordered mine and will be using my phone as a webcam. There is software to do it . It's unfortunate that they didn't add a webcam but not a deal breaker for me. The reason they are selling so much is because if the new Ryzen 4000 8 Core chips which are absolute monsters. If you need webcam and absolute performance similar to the G14/G15 Probably the A15. The screen color accuracy isn't the absolute best but performance is too notch. This is a 2.9Ghz 8 core 16 thread AMD Ryzen 7 4800H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD GTX 1660Ti 999 ,0.068,0.932,0.0,-0.7616,-1

gpfoh6,SuggestALaptop,Based on your requirement any latest Ryzen laptop won't give it unless you are willing to downgrade to A15/17 with mediocre screen quality as G14/15 do not had built-in webcam . Since you had a 2 000 budget it is easy to find a very powerful laptop. My tip is get an old model laptop 8750H and 9750H with maxed out GPU like gtx 2080 . It will suffice all your needs. Latest intel laptop is currently overpriced for its minimal improvement. If you are willing to wait probably the new Dell G5 15 SE might suit your needs if you are heavily inclined with the best Ryzen CPUs .,0.0,0.863,0.137,0.9402,1

If looking for a bit cheaper laptop consider Zephyrus G14 having the new AMD CPU. Hope this helps.,0.0,0.799,0.201,0.9485,1
gp1fje,SuggestALaptop,I agree with some of the comments gaming laptops should definitely be considered for modeling/drawing workloads. The right notebook will have the build quality and the battery life you're looking for as well. I recommend checking out our Stage 3 ELEMENT. Excellent performance monster battery magnesium body for added durability and weight reduction and backlit keyboard. Obviously it's more than up for gaming as well. Let me know if you have any questions ,0.0,0.804,0.196,0.9274,1
gp1fje,SuggestALaptop,hmmm that is a hard mix to find if you want something that will last a long time then you will have to pay a premium for it which you might consider expensive so let me give you both options if you want something affordable and powerful enough for your usage then It is currently out of stock and being overpriced so If you are not in a rush then I would recommend this Asus TUF FX505DT mainly because it offers great value for money and with high refresh range which is very rare for this range here is a review of it Specs AMD Ryzen 5 R5-3550H Processor GeForce GTX 1650 GPU 8GB DDR4 256GB PCIe SSD. 120Hz 15.6 Full HD 1920x1080 IPS screen with Thin Bezel RGB keyboard under 5 lbs. RJ-45 HDMI 2.0 USB 2.0 Type-A 2x USB Type-A 3.1 Gen Review Con All ports are on one side and it doesn't have USB type C. Con Gets loud fans under heavy load like gaming. Pro You can add an additional ram stick and additional 2.5 storage hard drive. Pro Very good build quality and heat management hot enough to be uncomfortable on your lap but not enough to throttle . Pro Very good battery life up to 7-8 hours during non gaming usage. If you are in a rush let me know and I will look for similar options. If you are willing to pay a premium to have it last longer then I would recommend this Lenovo thinkpad P53 because ThinkPads are known for their great battery life amazing build quality and very good keyboards and it comes with i7 hexa core CPU which is one of the best in your budget and great for your usage 16GB of RAM for smooth multitasking Good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15.6 inch Full HD IPS screen which is a must have for this price range thunderbolt port high build quality.

It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1089 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD.

The Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has the offer for the price. The 74Wh battery should net around 4-5 hours for light use. The reason why this laptop is better than the other Ryzen 4000 laptops is because it has a display with good color gamut coverage. But no number pad.

gp69no,SuggestALaptop,The AMD 4000 processors are absolutely legit They offer more cores for less money and less power consumption. The only issue is that since Intel is so big and established they are able to be in alot if different laptops AMD is slowly starting to be added to better and better models but still limited in options. I recommend the Ryzen 4000 series over pretty much all Intel chips because it literally is a plus at almost every front to go ryzen. Intel i3 starts at 2 cores Ryzen 3 starts at 4 cores Intel i5 is typically 4 cores Ryzen 5 is now 6 cores. Intel i7 is typically 4 cores for most and 8 cores at the crazy high end Ryzen 7 has 8 cores at very low power consumption. Linus did a test where a Ryzen 9 4900H was more powerful than the massive laptops with 8 core Intel chips using 90W of power while the 8 core Ryzen was using about 35W. I'll link it here.

gpcufm,SuggestALaptop,While the surface book is a really interesting design with the 2 in 1 form factor its really expensive for the hardware specs it offers. Unless you really use the tablet mode often with your current surface book I’d spend your money on other features in another laptop. The surface laptop is a solid ultrabook laptop and looks great and is super portable but not really that powerful. Compared to the surface book you’re missing that GPU power that comes in the keyboard dock. If you’re just going to be reading and writing papers using excel and prism with a little R and Matlab then the surface laptop would work fine. I’d stick to whatever OS your PI uses because sharing documents is sometimes a pain if you’re not using the same software. That being said having more power wouldn’t hurt. I’m a protein biochemist and for the first 4 years of my PhD all I used my laptop for was reading and writing and excel. But in my last year I’ve started doing some mathematical modeling of the enzymes I work with and that has been very taxing on my computer. Thankfully I have a gaming desktop that can handle the workload. TLDR I’d recommend something with a little more power. Like the new Ryzen 4700U and 16GB RAM.

I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review so here it goes It’s equipped with Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. The processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of the best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it’s not the best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops and it will run your games smoothly. Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles. It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles if you wanted to game you have the option. I'll link this AMD Ryzen 3000 series for 449 which is a great price and available You get a brand new 4 Core 8 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 449 My second recommendation is this Ryzen 4000 laptop which will be absolutely better than the Ryzen 3000 mentioned above and has 6 cores vs 4 on the 3000.

It's an absolute win if you can snag one. 6 core 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 4500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 479 This 4500u Lenovo is also a great deal at 539 if the second link is sold out NOTE this is a TN panel which don't tend to be the best in terms of color accuracy and viewing angles but should be fine for regular day to day use they are generally cheaper ,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.9909,1

gp6njr,SuggestALaptop,You will get a hundred opinions on this question and they are all right. All wrong too. The Mac-vs-PC question has been raging for almost 4 decades. Here is what advice I usually give. Go for Windows 10 if you want Gaming especially the latest AAA games Touch screen 2-in-1 and/or active stylus support You need hardware that isn’t available on MacBook without using a dongle USB-A HDMI SD card slot Ethernet port etc or a really large or really small screen. The most powerful hardware specs for the least amount of money You use an application which is unavailable on MacOS Your budget is less than 1000 Get a MacOS laptop if you want Impeccable hardware design and quality and when Apple does screw up they are more likely to launch a repair campaign or warranty extension than PC manufacturers Top notch support online and via local Apple stores Way better included software like iPhoto iMovie Notes GarageBand etc. High quality screens well suited for photo video editing MacBook Pros support DP3 color gamut for example Benfits of the MacOS ecosystem Especially if you use an iPhone including iMessage Keychain App Store Handoff iCloud Apple Pay Apple TV etc. You have more than 1000 budget Macs hold their value WAY better than PCs so some of the higher upfront cost is recovered years later on resale So which is best for you? Hard to say without knowing more. Generally you’ll find that comparing like-for-like specs you will pay a bit more for a Macintosh but not as much as you might think and you get a LOT of great free benefits like the software above and the better resale. I think most typical users find a Mac to be the more satisfying choice especially if they use an iPhone. For gamers or people on a tight budget Windows 10 is the clear winner. Flame suit on - ,0.026,0.804,0.17,0.9933,1
gp6njr,SuggestALaptop,Part 2 on what system specs you need? Again varies a lot by use case. For most people 8/256 is the bare minimum in 2020. That should be sufficient for typical tasks on both MacOS and Windows10. I generally advise people to get more RAM and then more storage because You can always add external storage but you can’t add external RAM Applications and OSs released in the future will require more RAM than today so RAM helps with longevity RAM in most laptops and all MacBooks is not upgradeable so you get what you get forever The cloud makes local storage less critical if you do get tight on space However buying MORE RAM than you need will provide exactly zero speed improvements. So overbuying is just a waste of money. 8GB is sufficient for most users in 2020 but 16 GB provides more future proofing. If you like keeping 20 Chrome tabs open your mail app music player video conferencing then 16gb is probably a good choice now. IF you are working with massive photo files that have lots of layers or very complex video editing you’ll know if this is you then you might need more than 16GB. Again if you need more than 16gb you probably know that very well. x200B Based on what you’ve said I think you should look at 1 2020 MacBook Pro 10th Gen i5 / 16/ 512. 1799 2 2020 MacBook Pro 8th gen i5 /16 /512 1599 3 2020 MacBook Air 10th gen i5 16/256 1299 4 2020 MacBook Air 10th gen i5 8/256 1099,0.023,0.914,0.063,0.8944,1

The ASUS ROG Zephyrus G15 has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside GTX 1660 Ti MQ graphics which can easily handle modern games at high settings 1080p. The Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has the offer for the price. The 74Wh battery should net around 4-5 hours for light use.

gp9zwt,SuggestALaptop,Maybe check out the dell g7? best buy has it right now for 1750 but also the highest quality open box version for 1400 There is also a 17 inch but the build quality is worse plastic and it’s heavier Has a 9th gen i7 2070 max w 16gb ram and a 512 gun nvme ssd. Screen is 1080p 144hz IPS and while I’m not 100% sure I think this version has the 90wh battery which last about 6 hours in a single charge with casual use. The smaller battery usually comes with an extra hard drive which is why I think this one has the big battery no extra hard drive. It’s a premium metallic build and while it is on the heavier side of the “thin and light” spectrum it’s still just 5.5 lbs but still thin at .8 inches. I think it does have an rgb keyboard but you can set the color to white and then there’s no rgb/gamer aesthetics just a grey metal machine with a white backlight. Does run kind of hot while gaming but casual use the temps are good and the fans are near silent. Gaming thermals can be solved with throttlestop/undervolting so it’s an easy fix although not an out of the box experience I have one and I love it Another option could be the eluktronics mag/max 15. Great laptops with good specs and a low key design.,0.081,0.787,0.132,0.9451,1
gp9zwt,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this Eluktronics MAG-15 Slim because of the following It comes with GTX 1660Ti GPU you can get the 2070 config if you fee like you will need it You can check the below link to see how the GTX 1660Ti GPU scroll down for the FPs and settings expected or ctrl f then type the name of your game . Developed by intel with corporation with different laptop brands. According to Dave2D it has great battery life up to 7 hours with regular usage and you prefer a good battery life. Very light for a gaming laptop at 4.15 lbs built with Magnesium alloyed all over The speaker gril is in the bottom of the laptop 3 USB A Thunderbolt 3 SD card reader and HDMI port. Easily upgradeable removing the back panel gives you access to 2 ram slots that can support up to 64GB ram the Wifi card if you want to change 2 NVMe cards and one of the biggest battery capacity at 93W/H. Screen is 144 HZ IPS with high color accuracy 96% RGP and 73% sRGB with up to 290 nt brightness. Bezels are pretty thin camera is up top. Keyboard is mechanical but it needs time to get used to it. Heat management is great and it comes undervolted so you can play with that if you need more CPU power.

gp8k5j,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips as they offer more performance for cheaper price and better battery than anything Intel can offer. Intel is offering 4 cores for the same price AMD is offering 6. The Vega 6 iGPU in the 4500U is almost as powerful as the MX230 which is a dedicated graphics card. It's actually really impressive because such a small integrated chip is almost head to head with a completely dedicated graphics chip which will consume more power. Here are some benchmarks between the 2 I also recommend this laptop because it has 6 cores compared to the 4 cores in the i5. And it should be cheaper. Configure this on lenovos website 6 core AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD VEGA iGPU With that config it's 644.99 ,0.0,0.873,0.127,0.9478,1

gp83a3,SuggestALaptop,I suggest looking into the new Ryzen 4000 chips that just were released. They are a little bit harder to find but They offer better performance across the board than Intel chips and use less electricity. Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles if you wanted to game you have the option. I'll link this AMD Ryzen 3000 series for 449 which is a great price and available You get a brand new 4 Core 8 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 449 My second recommendation is this Ryzen 4000 laptop which will be absolutely better than the Ryzen 3000 mentioned above and has 6 cores vs 4 on the 3000. The only thing is that it goes out of stock pretty quickly but for the price? It's an absolute win if you can snag one. 6 core 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 4500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 479 This 4500u Lenovo is also a great deal at 539 if the second link is sold out NOTE this is a TN panel which don't tend to be the best in terms of color accuracy and viewing angles but should be fine for regular day to day use they are generally cheaper ,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.9909,1

gp83a3,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure we can find you a touchscreen device that is a good value on a low budget. The Lenovo Flex 14 is my recommendation if you can wait for it to come back into stock. It comes with a 4-core Ryzen 5 processor 12 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 IPS display. This combination should be just fine for the uses you listed. You can use Lenovo's stylus to draw on the screen.,0.027,0.854,0.12,0.743,1
gpbymm,SuggestALaptop,Intel Iris and integrated are small graphics cards that are capable of pushing displays and LIGHT LIGHT graphic intensive work like light gaming But if you do 3D or rendering that leverages a graphics card a dedicated graphics card is usually required. That makes the laptop chunkier and bigger for the most part. It's needed to cool down the CPU and now dedicated GPU chip. I typically recommend having a capable GPU incase you do need it for your 3D CAD workflow. CPU is also very important for your work. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. For your budget I recommend the ASUS A15 This is a 2.9Ghz 8 core 16 thread AMD Ryzen 7 4800H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD GTX 1660Ti 999 ,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.9643,1
gpbymm,SuggestALaptop,Hi I think that you'll want at least a mid range graphics card for your use. So I agree with the other response I recommend the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 It has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside GTX 1660 Ti graphics which can easily handle your uses. The Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has the offer for the price. The massive 90Wh battery can yield 6 hours of battery life for light use.,0.0,0.852,0.148,0.8622,1
gpbymm,SuggestALaptop,If you prefer 2 in 1 and would be okay with no HDMI then I would recommend this Lenovo Yoga 730 because it comes with everything you need 8th generation i7 quad core CPU 16GB of ram good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15.6 inch 4K UHD IPS touch screen high build quality backlit keyboard supports pen and thunderbolt port. I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review so here it goes It’s equipped with Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. The processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of the best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it’s not the best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops. Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles. It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum. And if you prefer a traditional laptop then I would recommend this Lenovo thinkpad P53s because ThinkPads are known for their great battery life amazing build quality and very good keyboards and it comes with i7 quad core CPU which is one of the best in your budget and great for your usage 16GB of RAM for smooth multitasking Good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15.6 inch Full HD IPS screen which is a must have for this price range thunderbolt port and high build quality.

gpbwt8,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this Acer Swift 3 because of the following The casing made of brushed aluminum and looks very premium. The keyboard is a chiclet keyboard typing on it feels spongy but you get used to it quickly. Drag and drop sometimes doesn't work as intended but that is easily fixed with software. Screen is glossy Full HD IPS with very good viewing angles the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive . The main and maybe only con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get as it is not usable in direct sunlight. Has very good heat management and it doesn't throttle. Speakers provide very clear sounds and the maximum volume is pretty loud. Battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light to medium usage.

gp7his,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for the money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes with the New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

People should be thankful that Chewy is offering advice for free because he's wasting his time by doing so and he's gonna realize that soon and leave like he should. Besides people with products to shill most people join this sub because they are clueless and need basic advice hence the generic questions always being posted. Once they make their decision they leave and don't contribute anything to the community. I wish I had someone like Chewy who was enthusiastic about the topic to help me when I post a thread.

gpavc7,SuggestALaptop,Some users hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 13 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light with 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and make sure to get the Intel wifi 6 card.

gpavc7,SuggestALaptop,Not many laptops support touchscreen with pen while still having a decent GPU but if those are a must for you then I would recommend this Lenovo Yoga 730 because it comes with everything you need 8th generation i7 quad core CPU 16GB of ram good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15.6 inch 4K UHD IPS touch screen high build quality backlit keyboard supports pen and thunderbolt port. I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review so here it goes It’s equipped with Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. The processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of the best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it’s not the best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops and it will run your games smoothly. Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles. It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

gpap6l,SuggestALaptop,She needs more RAM. Opening many many chrome tabs will use significant ram. Most laptops sport 8GB of RAM so the next level up would be 16GB. I can recommend a laptop with 16GB of RAM that's premium but it's 15.6 for around 800-850 If she wants the 13.3 variant with 16GB of RAM it's about 1000 flat. Also if she has a billion chrome tabs open she will choke out any computer regardless of how powerful it is. The limitation will be RAM. She needs to better her workflow and bookmark or close things out. I know this is tough I constantly see this at work Usually 16GB is hard to find until you hit the 1000 mark but ill recommend what I have at 800 and 1000 if you can stretch I think it's worth it but you decide I recommend this 15.6 ENVY It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now.

gpap6l,SuggestALaptop,For the lower end of your budget Copying from another comment I just made for under 500 you got 2 great options either this off brand from walmart or This Lenovo Ideapad both offer very similar specs but personally I like the one from Walmart more because according to reviews the build quality is much better and it is also very light at 2.55 lbs iirc. For the higher end I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of the following The lid is made from brushed metal it can be opened easily with one hand and the case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. The display part flexes easily and the keyboard bends a little if you are hard typer. It is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means you can't connect external monitors using the port. The ram is not upgradeable so what you buy is what you get major con if 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning you would need to use Fn keys to use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not the best option if you are used to mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes with Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and the buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and the matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light the laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not to the point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal.

gp6ilq,SuggestALaptop,These are all great laptops but I think you can get more for your money. If you are open to moving to 14 you can get a laptop that is more powerful than some of the ones you posted in a thin and light without the gamer asthetics. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-11 hour battery life.

gp6etq,SuggestALaptop,The G14 is basically ready for anything you throw at it. The downside is the webcam and backlighting in the keyboard isn't great.

But honestly this is a laptop. Are you really going to drag the external webcam around with you everywhere in case you need to jump on a quick Zoom meeting? No. So you’ll inevitably find yourself in a situation where you wish you had a webcam and you don’t. If the laptop was going to stay in one place all of the time then an external webcam makes sense.

gp97yc,SuggestALaptop,For 1500 you will have a quite a few choices and as a college student you will also get student discounts from some manufacturers like Apple HP and Dell. The ASUS you listed is a decent choice but in my opinion is more expensive than you need for those specs and is really intended to be more of an ultra book emphasizing style and thinness than a workhorse for school. Given you want the laptop to last I would suggest paying a bit more and going with a Top Tier manufacturer and one of their higher-end models aka don’t get the cheaper models even from HP or Dell . ASUS is a good middle-tier laptop manufacturer. You didn’t indicate what your major is or if you want something you can take notes on so more data would be helpful for a specific recommendation. Here is what I would suggest generally 2-in-1 style HP Spectre x360 13t Dell XPS 13 Lenovo Yoga C940 Gaming not recommended as a general laptop as most gaming laptops are big bulky have terrible battery life often lack a webcam and screens are designed for fast refresh rates not color or clarity Razer Blade Stealth ASUS ROG Traditional0-style laptops Dell XPS non 2-in-1 Lenovo ThinkPad Apple MacBook Pro 2020 13inch 8th gen i5/16/512 1498 with student discount Now if I were actually going to spend 1500 as a new college student I wouldn’t get any of these. What WOULD I get? I would get the following Apple MacBook Air 2020 upgraded to i5 not i7 8/256 999 iPad Air 128 on sale a t Best Buy For 349 iPad case 50 Apple Pencil - 100 That is 1500 on the dot. And for that you get a good laptop and a good iPad. The iPad will be awesome for carrying to class taking notes reading ebooks consuming media and being an incredibly light little thing to carry that you won’t be crushed if it falls off a desk gets wet or stolen. It will also serve as a second screen for your MacBook using SideCar. The MacBook Air is the perfect companion for when you are ‘back home” doing real work.

It comes with 10th Gen i5 quad core CPU. Slim sleek. The lid of the device has a matte finish on its aluminum material. On the other side the plastic material on the rest of the chassis is retained. Its lid cannot be opened with a single hand. On the bright side it is sturdy and prone to flexes. Moreover we see an upgrade in the hinge department that leaves them a lot stronger than before. The narrow-bezel design offers more real estate for amazing images. Crisp true-to-life colors come alive on a 15.6” Full HD IPS display with Acer Color Intelligence.

gp354w,SuggestALaptop,Idk about the Ryzen 5 I've heard the 4000 series are great but haven't looked into it myself yet. But a GTX 1650 should do you well. I have an i5 and a 1650 in my Asus Tuf FX505 which I think is an older version of what you're looking at. I haven't met a game yet that I couldn't manage medium 60fps. In fact Witcher 3 can do a mix of high and Ultra at 60fps. Idk about rdr2 I've heard it's really punishing on hardware but as a general rule I've found the 1650 to do a solid job for the price. If an Xbox one s or a PS4 runs a game at 30fps you can expect the 1650 to run it at 60fps with a little better graphics settings. Honestly most games run great. Crysis 3 does 60fps without even stressing the machine. If it's not known for being especially graphically intensive like Witcher 3 or RDR2 then you can probably run it on high or Ultra if it's a couple years old. But even the heavy hitters like the above mentioned will run 60fps with some settings compromises.,0.041,0.809,0.15,0.9719,1
gp354w,SuggestALaptop,The 4600H and 1650 will be just fine. Enjoy your new laptop!,0.0,0.654,0.346,0.6476,1
gp354w,SuggestALaptop,I will have to say your expectations and what the hardware your buying is mismatched. A 1650 is one of the lowest GPU for gaming GPU for laptops. Nvidia current lineup in terms of performance MX cards 1650 1660 2060 2070 2080. A detailed list is here showing top performance from insane workstation cards to intergrated GPUs such Intel HD Graphics. Keywords to look out for are Geforce GTX or RTX cards Quadros are workstation cards. So its nice that you are getting a laptop. But ask if you can save that budget for a better machine. Or see if you do pickup a job that the job will supplement you with an IT budget for working at home. That way you can have 2 people pay for your laptop without you needing to contribute to it.,0.048,0.874,0.078,0.6461,1
gp354w,SuggestALaptop,People are correct that prices are a bit inflated right now from covid but that also might not change for like another year.... So weigh your options. Honestly I think you'll be pretty happy with the a15 though I do recommend throwing in another stick of RAM once you get it. Cheap and very easy to do. Tons of tutorials online. And for god's sake make sure you have an SSD. There's generally a second slot for storage so don't worry too much if you buy it with relatively small storage space. But seriously if you have an HDD instead of an SSD you are not having a modern computing experience. Night and day difference. Seriously. You want your OS and core programs on an SSD and the easiest way to do that is buy a computer with an SSD installed already. Later you can add your own second SSD for storing games. You can get 1tb for about 100 if you shop around.,0.037,0.788,0.175,0.9813,1
gp4to0,SuggestALaptop,The specs are amazing on both of these laptops. They both use the new Ryzen 4000 chips which are killing right now and a 1660ti which is powerful enough for some good gaming experience. It just boils down to size. Do you want a 15 laptop or a 17 one. Personally I would get the 15 because 17 just seems too large for me to haul around. If you are going to be hauling this thing around school I would suggest to look at the G14 as well if your budget allows. It's just as powerful as these big guys but smaller at 14 . And the build quality is better on the G14. I think it's worth a look. It comes with an 8 Core/16 thread AMD Ryzen 9 4900H 16GB RAM expandable 1TB SSD expandable Intel Wifi 6 card RTX 2060 Pantone calibrated 120HZ 1080p screen 1449 brand new.

gp1s22,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper and more secure The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 10-13 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a professional environment. It comes with an 3Ghz 8 Core/16 Thread AMD Ryzen 4900H 16GB RAM expandable to 40GB 1TB SSD expandable RTX 2060 1440p display 60hz 1799 Here are some reviews to help you ,0.0,0.917,0.083,0.8016,1
gp7noh,SuggestALaptop,Hi I think that you'll need to make sacrifices in this price range. More specifically it will be hard to find a laptop with a display with good color gamut coverage. So if that is fine I'd go with the Lenovo ThinkPad E595 It comes with a 4-core processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 15.6 IPS display. This combination should easily handle general use tasks. Battery life is around 7-8 hours for light use and weighs around 4.7lbs. It is a durable and reliable business grade laptop.,0.016,0.904,0.08,0.6908,1
gp7noh,SuggestALaptop,ThinkPads are generally regarded as the tanks of the laptop world and for good reason. They are just really solid no-frills machines which can take a beating and just keep going. Your price range is going to result in some compromises though but something like this HP Envy is worth a look at 499. ,0.078,0.771,0.151,0.5182,1
gp7noh,SuggestALaptop,It is currently out of stock and being overpriced so If you are not in a rush then I would recommend this Acer Aspire 5 because of the following Keyboard with number pad like you want. It offers great value for money since it comes with 8 GB RAM and 512GB SSD. It comes with 10th Gen i5 quad core CPU. Slim sleek. The lid of the device has a matte finish on its aluminum material. On the other side the plastic material on the rest of the chassis is retained. Its lid cannot be opened with a single hand. On the bright side it is sturdy and prone to flexes. Moreover we see an upgrade in the hinge department that leaves them a lot stronger than before. The narrow-bezel design offers more real estate for amazing images. Crisp true-to-life colors come alive on a 15.6” Full HD IPS display with Acer Color Intelligence. Battery life advertised Up to 9.5-hours Battery Life. you can upgrade RAM up to 12GB. Comes with a range of ports including USB 3.1 Type C Gen 1 port 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports USB 2.0 port and HDMI port. Comes with NVIDIA GeForce MX250 GPU and you can check the performance from this link Here is a more detailed review of the Acer Aspire 5 under 500 Due to the Virus a lot of laptops are being overpriced so make sure to check this list of overpriced laptops before you buy any laptop at the moment,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.9848,1
gp1gia,SuggestALaptop,Neither of these are the best laptops for their price the S340 is an entrly level Ideapad and the plastic body and poor build don't justify that hefty price tag.

gp1gia,SuggestALaptop,You can get more for your money than these two. Check out this HP on sale at Best Buy For 799. Also if you see HDD listed for any laptop as storage pass it by. That stands for Hard Disk Drive - the old-fashioned spinning platter storage technology that way outdated in 2020. It is super slow vulnerable to damage if moved while the laptop is powered on and uses a lot more battery. SSD is what you want. Solid State Drive.

gp1nzb,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm in the same situation as you and I'm looking at amd laptops as they are very power efficient and seem to run cooler under normal load and provide amazing battery life when not gaming . I'm looking at lenovo legion 5 but it's not out yet. There is also asus g14 but it's not optimised out of the box. Can you let me know which laptop you'd buy? I'll also be coding and playing light games.,0.035,0.883,0.081,0.4122,1
gp1nzb,SuggestALaptop,Hey there I was in the same boat I'm a BTech 3rd year student and needed a powerful laptop for computation and very occasional gaming. These were my requirements in order of importance 1. A good display with a good color gamut 90% this was the most important thing for me as my current laptop has a horrific display with 30-40% sRGB coverage this was provided by my university so I had no option but to use it. 2. Processing power a good GPU and CPU 3. Build Quality I would prefer a metal keyboard deck 4. No red accents I think it looks cheesy So after looking around for almost 20-30 days I finally ordered the Helios 300 yesterday from flipkart for 75k 1. It has my requirements covered properly even though it only has a 60hz display it has 96% sRGB and 73% Adobe RGB. 2. Has a pretty powerful CPU GPU combo i5 9300h and 1660ti 3. Has a metal lid and wraparound metal keyboard deck 4. Has less cheesy blue accents I considered several different options the Zephyrus that's sold on flipkart didn't cut it because of the pathetic display 40-60% sRGB coverage. I found this to be the case with most of the laptops being sold all of them had an average of 50% sRGB coverage. The only exceptions being Acer laptop Nitro 7 and the predator line. The vivobook gaming has bad display that's why I ruled that out too As for Intel vs AMD the 4th gen Ryzen does perform better than the intel counterparts but currently we're only getting the 3rd gen Ryzen in India and compared to that the Intel performs better If you want the best build quality then the Trition 300 that's on flipkart is a very good choice it's has metal on all the touch surfaces but do keep in mind that it still has a plastic chassis. Here's the link for the Helios i5-9300h 1660ti 60hz ,0.049,0.83,0.121,0.9717,1
gp5szz,SuggestALaptop,Thinkpad for sure. The keyboard itself is already worth the premium not to mention the quality of other components durability and compatibility with most Linux distorts. Since you’ll be typing and debugging a lot you’ll come to appreciate the feedback and precision of thinkpad keyboards. Zenbook keyboards while good come nowhere close.,0.046,0.787,0.168,0.7287,1
gp2j7i,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this Lenovo Yoga 730 because it comes with everything you need 8th generation i7 quad core CPU 16GB of ram good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15.6 inch 4K UHD IPS touch screen high build quality backlit keyboard supports pen and thunderbolt port. I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review so here it goes It’s equipped with Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. The processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of the best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it’s not the best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops. Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles. It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

It's a premium laptop that trades blows with the bigger chunkier laptops while being suuuper slim and non gamery looking. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped.

The U in stands for low power so you could expect decent battery life from this laptop. It has 8gb of ram which is ok for what you are doing. It is only one stick of ram and the laptop can accept two sticks so you can upgrade to 16gb of ram in the future. It only has integrated graphics but it’s ok for what you will be doing on it. It has a 500gb hard drive so it can hold plenty of things like applications documents photos videos etc. It has Windows 8.1 Pro which isn’t the best operating system but you can get used to it it’s not that different from other versions of Windows. It has a 1366x768 14 inch screen so it’s not the highest resolution screen but considering the size it will still look nice. The laptop is made out of metal and soft touch plastic and has a backlit keyboard. The only real downside is that it doesn’t include a webcam.

The 1650 is an entry level GPU and can play the esports titles you listed no problem. The laptop is super portable. Kind of a gaming ultrabook hybrid.

Con No TB3 or USB C charging. Pro Good upgrade options. But if you prefer more powerful GPU and CPU can push your budget a little higher if you are going to do any intensive video editing then then I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for the money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes with the New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port. Very good heat management in general but it is better for the GPU than it is for the CPU.

The 1650 Ti model comes with a 120hz display while the regular 1650 model comes with a 60hz display. If you are very picky about your refresh rate then your only choice is the 120hz model. The surface book 2 is a great machine the ergonomics of the tablet to laptop design is great especially for media consumption. However the display is high resolution almost 4k I believe which means most games will look a little blurry when playing at 1080p and the GPU just won't handle anything very well if you try to set the gaming resolution to the native screen resolution.

gozdxx,SuggestALaptop,Hi! So you have chosen three amazing products that will definitely satisfy all that you're looking for however you should know that gaming laptops generally don't focus on good quality speakers so I'm afraid most of your chosen products will have around the same bad-average quality speakers. Since you're looking for a light thin and 15-inch laptop with a great display the ASUS Gephyrus 14 is an amazing laptop with the best battery life of ALL gaming laptops in the market right now. It's lightweight and powerful enough to play any game now and upcoming games in the future as well the sound quality is not going to be as impressive as a Macbook so don't get your hopes up on that part. On the Youtube review of the ASUS Gephyrus 14 linked HERE Austin Evans mentions that he doesn't like the keyboard as much so keep that in mind. As for the Gigabyte 15 I personally have the Gigabyte Aero 15 with GTX 1070 Max-Q and although Gigabyte laptops aren't that popular I can tell you that the display to the laptop is amazing and I feel comfortable typing on it's keyboard right now although it's not without it's flaws I'm not a fan of the dedicated numpad that shifts the entire alphabetic keyboard to the left the sound quality is horrible so invest in good headphones. The fan noise of my laptop is very loud and I have to wear noise-cancelling headphones whenever I play games but honestly the fan noise is gonna be loud on all gaming laptops . The temperatures average around 50-60C undervolted and the battery lasts about 6-7 hours. But other than that I love my Gigabyte Aero 15. I'm sure that whichever product you choose it's gonna be a dang good laptop. So if you can't make a choice then choose whichever device that can fill your needs and like the look of the laptop the most.,0.063,0.815,0.122,0.9669,1
gow7zd,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this ASUS Zenbook because of the following The lid is made from brushed metal it can be opened easily with one hand and the case is made from metal as well so overall build quality. The display part flexes easily and the keyboard bends a little if you are hard typer. It is very light at 2.5 lbs it has 2 USB 3 one USB type C HDMI and micro SD. USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means you can't connect external monitors using the port. The ram is not upgradeable so what you buy is what you get major con if 8 is not enough for your usage. Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down Home and End keys don't have their own keys meaning you would need to use Fn keys to use them and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not the best option if you are used to mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer. Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes with Microsoft’s Precision and supports multitouch gestures. Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and the buttons are firm. Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering which is a good thing and it is very bright. Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB. High brightness and the matte display makes it great for outside usage. Screen is IPS has great viewing angles. Because of how small and light the laptop is it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time over 30 mins in intensive work but in short bursts it works very well. Fan gets loud under heavy work but not to the point where it would be annoying. Sound quality is good but bass is minimal. Battery supports quick charge a big plus and Asus claims it can charge up to 60% in less than 50 mins. Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 to 9.5 hours.

gow7zd,SuggestALaptop,Some users hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light with 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and make sure to get the Intel wifi 6 card. Total should be around 1009 and 1100 for 512GB SSD If you want to save some case you can choose the 4500U and 8GB of RAM but for the small price difference the 16GB is ideal.,0.044,0.753,0.203,0.9859,1
gow7zd,SuggestALaptop,The HP Envy is a solid choice as is the Lenovo Yoga C740. In Apple land you can get the 2020 MacBook Air i3/8/256 for 1000 which will also support your needs.

govphv,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper and more secure.

govphv,SuggestALaptop,Within your budget you can get a better GPU so I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for the money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes with the New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port. Very good heat management in general but it is better for the GPU than it is for the CPU.

gop2ls,SuggestALaptop,The HP Envy is great. I have the same uses as you but I bought my 2-in-1 a month ago before Ryzen 4000 launched. I bought a Dell Inspiron 7390 Black Edition. While it's fine I would have bought the Envy if I could. A comparison Dell has Thunderbolt 4k screen worse battery life and a really unique pen garage built into the laptop. Envy has a much better processor and graphics and I think thinner bezels. Spectre is a bit overpriced a bit like the XPS and MacBook . It might feel nicer but it has bad battery due to the 4k OLED screen and throttles according to reviews.,0.133,0.719,0.148,0.1779,1

gosw7z,SuggestALaptop,I'd you are down to move to a 14 you can get basically the most powerful portable laptop out right now I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-11 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a professional environment.

It has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside GTX 1660 Ti MQ graphics which can easily handle modern games at high settings 1080p. The Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has the offer for the price. The 74Wh battery should net around 4-5 hours for light use.,0.0,0.876,0.124,0.8422,1

gow8m4,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we can find you a powerful 2-in-1 laptop within budget. I recommend the Lenovo Yoga 730 The 1 259.99 CAD configuration comes with a 4-core i4 processor and GTX 1050 graphics paired with a 1080p 15.6 IPS touchscreen display.

gosifc,SuggestALaptop,Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. Comparable to a mx230 discrete card You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1089 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not to skimp on the screen and wifi on any of these configs. Trust me. ,0.052,0.807,0.141,0.9727,1

gooaz0,SuggestALaptop,With 1500 you should be able to find a great machine. You say your main use would be for DJing and video editing. Anything with at least 12GB of RAM and preferably a 6-core CPU with a 512 GB SSD would do the job for you. If you carry around a mass amount of audio data for your mixing an external solution like an external 1 TB drive should suffice. In regards to video editing for sure you should be looking for a PC with a GPU graphics processing unit but the specific one depends on how demanding your editing would be.

gohy4f,SuggestALaptop,You can get a lot of good laptops for 1500. In your situation since you'll be working on a lot of applications and software with lots of browser tabs open I'd get something with a powerful CPU ram and even a discrete GPU which can power applications like Adobe acrobat etc. I would recommend buying a gaming laptop even if you don't game at all they are designed to handle power hungry applications and focus on performance- core i7-9750h CPU atleast and 16GB ram are commonly found. Some of them come in durable aluminium build such as razer blade pro and Acer Predator helios 300.

But if you want it to dual for some really light gaming and maybe some other applications I would recommend the Dell xps series for around 1500 usd which is just barely above your price range or the Asus rog g14 with the new ryzen 4800 chip if you want more gaming and can wait a lil while to get it. Both of these have outrageously long batteries great screens are very thing and light with the xps being a lot more slim.

gos6f6,SuggestALaptop,Since it is is for work purposes and you will moving from work to home you need a laptop with a strong build quality. Check out the Acer Swift 3 SF314-55G-78U1 as it has a premium feel and a decent amount of power. 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U NVIDIA GeForce MX150 14 Full HD 8GB DDR4 256GB PCIe SSD It is very lightweight and has a sturdy aluminum chassis which is ideal for moving about as it can take a few bumps and bruises.

gos6f6,SuggestALaptop,Hi for a work device I'd go with a business grade laptop since they are very durable and reliable. The Lenovo ThinkPad E595 is my recommendation. It comes with a 4-core processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 15.6 IPS display. This combination should easily handle general use tasks.

gos6f6,SuggestALaptop,Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1089 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not to skimp on the screen and wifi on any of these configs. Trust me. ,0.053,0.803,0.144,0.9727,1

goj7yy,SuggestALaptop,Not sure about conversion rates or the Italian market but Asus TUF A15 with the Ryzen 7 4800H 16GB RAM and a GTX1660ti is 1000 USD and would do everything you listed. EDIT here's a youtube review of the RTX 2060 version ,0.038,0.962,0.0,-0.1232,-1
goj7yy,SuggestALaptop,This is the closest I can get for 1000 if you can bump your budget you can get a better GPU but this should suffice. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-11 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a professional environment.

gokkcj,SuggestALaptop,The MSI PS63 Modern-008 would be a good option to look at. The PS63 is powerful enough to manage your productivity needs. It has a clean and professional look so you can take it anywhere without sticking out as a gamer. It has a dual fan step up to keep the laptop cool and you can adjust the fans with software if it is too loud for you. It is well built as it body is very sturdy and the screen has little flex. Battery wise you can get around 12hrs of use after a full charge which is rare for a laptop with this much power. It has over 90% sRGB rating which is great for editing. It is constantly in and out of stock so you can either wait for it or get one of its variants,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.964,1

gomh7d,SuggestALaptop,Hi I think that you should also consider adding the MSI GF65 Thin onto your list since it is on sale currently. You get a 4-core i5 processor RTX 2060 graphics and a 1080p 15.6 120Hz IPS display. In comparison to the EVOO Gaming Laptop you save 100 and get a stronger GPU but less RAM and a weaker processor.

Screen Size 15.3 inches Processor Intel Core i5-9300H Graphics NVIDIA GTX 1650 RAM 8 GB Storage Type 512 SSD This laptop has a clean and professional so you can take it anywhere without sticking out as a gamer. It has a fair amount of ports so you won't have to bring a dongle to attach what you need. Its has adequate power to gaming and manage productivity tasks such as editing CAD work smoothly.

gojrs9,SuggestALaptop,The new Ryzen 4000 chips just launched but are a bit better but are harder to find. They offer better performance across the board than Intel chips and use less electricity. Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles if you wanted to game you have the option. I'll link this AMD Ryzen 3000 series for 449 which is a great price and available You get a brand new 4 Core 8 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 449 My second recommendation is this Ryzen 4000 laptop which will be absolutely better than the Ryzen 3000 mentioned above and has 6 cores vs 4 on the 3000. The only thing is that it goes out of stock pretty quickly but for the price? It's an absolute win if you can snag one. 6 core 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 4500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 479 This 4500u Lenovo is also a great deal at 539 if the second link is sold out NOTE this is a TN panel which don't tend to be the best in terms of color accuracy and viewing angles but should be fine for regular day to day use they are generally cheaper All of these recommendations are for LIGHT gaming.,0.0,0.829,0.171,0.9926,1

gojjs2,SuggestALaptop,Have a look at the Acer Aspire 5 it is a great value for money laptop that can do a little of everything. It can easily be upgraded if you want to add more RAM or more storage space. Its 10th gen processor is both powerful and energy-efficient so it won't drain the laptop's impressive battery life. Additionally it has a dGPU that is able to game as well. Build wise it is solid and should be able to last a few years as long as you don’t spill anything on it 15.6 Full HD IPS Display 10th Gen Intel Core i5-10210U NVIDIA GeForce MX250 8GB DDR4 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 802.11ax Backlit KB,0.0,0.815,0.185,0.9643,1

goetmb,SuggestALaptop,I just switched to a Thinkpad after being very disappointed with a Dell XPS 13 which didn’t hold up well at all. The X1 Carbon was one of the options I looked at for a Thinkpad I didn’t end up going with it but I’d certainly think it’s better than the XPS.,0.042,0.797,0.161,0.7433,1
goetmb,SuggestALaptop,As previous XPS 13 owner I would strongly consider that you go with Lenovo. I think astronauts use Lenovo up in space. XPS line is simply not worth it. They are like the Apple products of Windows devices. x200B They break easily like literally my hinge broke off because it's held together with plastic. If that doesn't break then you might have a blue screen or screen flickering or the annoying buzzing sound from the power supply. Too many things can go wrong. Avoid the trouble and pick up a Lenovo. You will be much happier. XPS also solders their memory so the only thing you can upgrade is SSD. Good luck.,0.118,0.737,0.146,0.5624,1

Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY.

It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games.

god8n3,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend a 13 inch Ultrabook with either Ryzen 4000U series processors or Intel Icelake 10th gen . These devices are thin and light and will help you greatly as a student Since battery is most important to you when not gaming at 1200 you can get an amazing Ultrabook with 8-9 hours of battery life. Since you only play LoL the iGPU inside those specific processor generations will run LoL without a doubt 60 fps at 1080p near mid-High settings. The obvious choices for Intel would be a Dell XPS 13 personal recommendation based on your needs XPS 13 2-in-1 HP Envy HP Spectre and Razer Blade Stealth runner up recommendation . DO NOT I REPEAT GET AN LG GRAM. THEY ARE THROTTLING NIGHTMARES. The choices for AMD would be a HP Envy x360 personal recommendation lenovo IdeaPad S540 runner up or a Surface laptop. If you wanna save a quick buck the older Ryzen based APUs Ryzen 3000U are still okay for LoL. 60 fps at 1080p with low-mid settings The Core i7-1065G7 4 core 8 thread is close to a core i5-6500 desktop chip! at 25w you'll be able to game really well on it even if it's igpu slightly higher than a 940mx but slightly below a mx150 is a few tiers lower than the AMD one due to it's mostly strong single core performance. Multitasking may take a hit BUT it supports higher memory clocks 3733 vs 3600 and performs on average better than ryzen in a single channel configuration. The Ryzen 4700U 8 core 8 thread is a multitasking beast goes head to head with a great iGPU on par with the MX150 1D12 but for single core workloads may fall behind depending on if your laptop has dual channel memory. Memory means a lot for ryzen apus. The added benefit is these devices are modern and will last you 4 years. They all have biometric security built in as well.,0.021,0.836,0.143,0.9891,1

gochgk,SuggestALaptop,Some hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it. So here goes!!!!! I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. They have more performance better battery better security and lower cost compared to Intel. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1089 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not to skimp on the screen and wifi on any of these configs. Trust me. ,0.052,0.802,0.146,0.9761,1

goeyia,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this New Asus TUF Gaming A15 because it offers great value and specs for the money and since it is very new here is a small review of it Comes with the New 8 core CPU AMD Ryzen 7 4800H . Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery . The smaller battery will give you 2.5 3 hours of battery life during normal usage expect to double if you get the bigger battery life . This version has the bigger battery Screen hinges are tight so it will be hard to open it with one hand Screen is Full HD IPS with 144Hz refresh rate comes with 65% sRGB 49% aRGB and 284 nits brightness. We don't have an exact number on response time but it appears to be average or slightly below for a 144Hz screen Small power brick but overpowered for what you will need. Keyboard is quite trackpad is smooth accurate and with dedicated buttons the Audio is also average. Comes with HDMI port 3 USB 3.1 1 USB C combo mich and headspeakers port.

Windows computer are made by TONS of manufacturers like Dell HP Lenovo Asus Acer so that tends to get a bit more rockier since there is more possibilities of issues. For the most part tho working in IT all computers have issues. That includes Mac. The positive for apple is MacOS is very pretty and nicely made. The laptops are also very sturdy and high quality. The negative is that it's expensive as hell and underpowered. You also are at the mercy of apple so if they decide to get rid of a USB port you are forced to buy a 79 adapter.

godahk,SuggestALaptop,The new Ryzen 4000 chips just launched but are a bit harder to find. They offer better performance across the board than Intel chips and use less electricity. Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles if you wanted to game you have the option. I'll link this AMD Ryzen 3000 series for 449 which is a great price and available You get a brand new 4 Core 8 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 449 My second recommendation is this Ryzen 4000 laptop which will be absolutely better than the Ryzen 3000 mentioned above and has 6 cores vs 4 on the 3000. The only thing is that it goes out of stock pretty quickly but for the price? It's an absolute win if you can snag one. 6 core 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 4500u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU 479 This 4500u Lenovo is also a great deal at 539 if the second link is sold out NOTE this is a TN panel which don't tend to be the best in terms of color accuracy and viewing angles but should be fine for regular day to day use they are generally cheaper ,0.0,0.836,0.164,0.991,1

Some users hate me recommending this same laptop over and over but until they give an alternative at this price and performance I'll keep recommending it.

go9zx0,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this Lenovo Yoga 730 because it comes with everything you need 8th generation i7 quad core CPU 16GB of ram good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15.6 inch 4K UHD IPS touch screen high build quality backlit keyboard supports pen and thunderbolt port. I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review so here it goes It’s equipped with Intel Core i7-8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. The processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming. Full HD IPS 15.6 4K Touchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of the best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it’s not the best choice for outside usage. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops and it will run your games smoothly. Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles. It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

go93zw,SuggestALaptop,You want dGPU for those applications. No MBA have them. At a similar price point you can try lower end gaming laptops like the new ASUS TUF A15. dGPU will help a lot in these applications.,0.11,0.727,0.163,0.2732,1
go93zw,SuggestALaptop,Will those apps run on the base i3? Yes. For sure. Will those apps run with performance acceptable to you? Maybe. In the USA upgrading from the i3 to the i5 is only 100 and doubles the number of available cores which will provide a HUGE jump in short-term multicore performance. That is likely a no-brainer upgrade for most people. Why do I say short term? Because any lengthy processor-intensive task which heat-loads the CPU will run right into the MacBook Air’s weak thermal headroom and begin to downshift the CPU frequency. At some point with a sustained heavy load the 4 core i5 and the 2-core i3 end up performing about the same as the limitation becomes how much heat the MacBook Air can dissipate spoiler alert not much . The MacBook Air is really designed for ‘typical’ workloads which just tax the CPU for small bursts. The MBA is more than capable of handling this type of load. Sustained tasks like rendering on the other hand are not well suited to the MBA as it cannot keep its CPU cool enough over longer periods of time. One of my most ongoing head-scratching questions is why Apple does not connect the CPU to the cooling fan with a heat pipe on the 2018-2020 MacBook Airs. Crazy. The prior MacBook Air and all of the MacBook Pros have heat pipes as do virtually all mainstream PC laptops. Is the Base 2020 MBA better than the 2019 MBP? No. The MBA is worse in all but 2 areas. 2019 MacBook Pro is better 4 core 8th gen 25watt CPU vs. 2 core 10th gen 9 watt CPU Higher resolution screen DP3 color space suppport vs. not 100 Nits brighter screen backlight Much better thermal headroom Better speakers 2020 MacBook Air better .25 pound lighter and slightly thinner on one side WAY WAY better keyboard The biggest downside of the 2019 MacBook Pro is the butterfly keyboard but it comes with a 4 year extended warranty.,0.044,0.839,0.117,0.9738,1
go93zw,SuggestALaptop,In my opinion you'd be very disappointed as with the I3 graphics probably a UHD 630 you'd get worse performance than say...a 500 - 600 dollar HP since the resolution is so much higher and Apples laptop cooling always makes it slower than other makes.,0.137,0.863,0.0,-0.7574,-1

go8ta5,SuggestALaptop,The Asus has a slightly better cooling system because its fans are separated unlike the Nitro 5 where its dual fans are shared between its CPU and GPU. However if I remember correctly the Asus has less vents than the Nitro 5 so the difference is the Asus is only cooler by 2-3C. Also check the refresh rates of their screens since Asus has a 120 hz screen compared to the Nitro 5's default 60hz screen. The Asus though is more color inaccurate than the Nitro 5. Overall though both are good laptops and it only depends on your needs. If you're just primarily gaming though I'd go for the Asus TUF 505DY or better yet if you can wait for Asus TUF's next gen Ryzen CPUs.,0.0,0.918,0.082,0.8595,1

goc9yv,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we can find you a viable gaming laptop. If you can go over budget I recommend the ASUS TUF FX505DY It comes with a 4-core Ryzen 5 processor RX 560X 4 GB graphics and a 1080p 15.6 display.

gnv3qj,SuggestALaptop,just a note integrated gpu like vega greatly benefits from dual channel RAM having two RAM sticks in your computer boosting fps dramatically in a lot of games.

Without the dual channel RAM vega 10 isnt nearly as fast as the mx230,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.8357,1
gnv3qj,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips as they offer more performance for cheaper price and better battery than anything Intel can offer. Intel is offering 4 cores for the same price AMD is offering 6. The Vega 6 iGPU in the 4500U is almost as powerful as the MX230 which is a dedicated graphics card. It's actually really impressive because such a small integrated chip is almost head to head with a completely dedicated graphics chip which will consume more power. Here are some benchmarks between the 2 I also recommend this laptop because it has 6 cores compared to the 4 cores in the i5. And it should be cheaper.

goaiki,SuggestALaptop,Consider the Acer Spin 3 This model comes with an 8th Generation i5 CPU which should perform well considering you're not doing anything really intensive 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. This configuration is good for the average student so I think you can do your usual tasks without a problem and it's a 2-in-1 so you get an IPS touchscreen that can flip around into a tablet for presentations and media consumption. The build quality on this laptop is pretty good considering that it's 680 and it's 3.8 pounds so it's fairly light. It has a 14 display which is a sweet spot for most people. The only downside is that the screen is kind of dim but it's still usable. Finally the keyboard generally has no complaints. If you're willing to spend a little more 750 check out the Lenovo Flex 14 This one is also a 2-in-1 with a 14 display but it has better specs. The Ryzen 7 CPU is going to perform better for multi-tasking 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD so that you get a better and smoother experience overall. The build quality isn't great but it should last you a while around 4 years . Lenovo is known to have good keyboards so there shouldn't be any problems here. Lastly the display is slightly brighter than the Acer's. I hope this helped and feel free to ask me any questions!,0.048,0.79,0.161,0.9793,1
goahnl,SuggestALaptop,I have a recommendation that is not extremely conventional but it should be more powerful than the the ThinkPad you have listed there.

go3s5e,SuggestALaptop,I would suggest a MacBook for your situation but having a two in one surface device could have its benefits for note taking. I would evaluate how much you care about typing experience vs touch screen. Personally I like the iPad Pro a lot more than the short time I used the Surface pro for note taking so I would look into using it as a computer with a keyboard it doesn’t suit everyone but it could suit you.,0.0,0.858,0.142,0.899,1
go6193,SuggestALaptop,That laptop has a 1.3ghz Intel core i3 which is only a dual core. What I am going to recommend to you has double the cores and threads at the same exact price.

go1qn1,SuggestALaptop,The G14 is a pretty nice little powerhouse for the price and size. Not a dealbreaker for many because of the power but just note that it does not have a webcam. You can use ivcam to use your phone as a webcam if needed Aside from that the G14 is probably the best bang for buck machine in a min gamery looking chasis.,0.0,0.851,0.149,0.8689,1

Right now here are all your options with a new Ryzen processor and powerful dedicated graphics search engine You can see and change the search parameters using the Refine results button in the upper-left part of the search results page. You can also click on the laptops for more information. All my results have a plastic chassis and if you're used to the build quality of a Mac I don't recommend any of these. I'd wait. Hope I helped!,0.0,0.843,0.157,0.9259,1
go3f3j,SuggestALaptop,The base MacBook Air i3 would be decent but for 100 more I strongly recommend the i5. Double the processor cores which will definitely help in a lot of use cases multiple chrome tabs for example . 8gb on a Mac is 'ok' meaning you should be fine with it given your use case but it is definitely on the low end these days. The thing about Ram is that buying more than you need provides zero performance boost and 8GB should be fine for you. I would get the i5 though. For everyone trashing the MBA it is not a bargain but is a fair value. It has an excellent screen Touch ID the T2 security chip and all of the free benefits of the Apple ecosystem including iMovie iPhoto Apple Pay Notes Keychain iCloud Music a year of Apple TV free News etc. It might be a little light on the hardware but makes up for it with software.,0.032,0.698,0.27,0.9935,1
go3f3j,SuggestALaptop,i think the base version would work but since you’re getting the student discount i’d say maybe upgrade something like the storage or ram and go a little over budget for something that will be more powerful in the long run storage would prob be the thing to get more of unless you have external drives you back up to often it makes things really convenient to just have the storage there i don’t really know anything about dell laptops i’ve heard they’ve gotten better but i guess it’s up to you,0.0,0.883,0.117,0.905,1
go3f3j,SuggestALaptop,To be honest it's extremely over priced for what you get. If you are open to it I can recommend something that's great build quality but high end specs that will at least allow you to run 15 chrome tabs at the same time. 8GB is NOTHING.,0.0,0.827,0.173,0.7783,1
go3f3j,SuggestALaptop,it just allows you to multitask more and be quicker at it and the computer will better be able to handle larger files like big word and excel files otherwise it’s not imperative but you might wanna look into the benefits of more ram if possible,0.0,0.822,0.178,0.7964,1

go9n6u,SuggestALaptop,Hi since you're looking for your laptop to last you shouldn't go for a consumer grade laptop like the HP Envy x360 or Lenovo Flex 14. A business grade laptop is the best fit. The Lenovo ThinkPad E595 is my recommendation. It comes with a 4-core processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 15.6 IPS display. This combination should easily handle general use tasks. Battery life is around 7-8 hours for light use and weighs around 4.7lbs.,0.025,0.836,0.139,0.8591,1

go5lw8,SuggestALaptop,Hey I recommend the Dell Inspiron This Inspiron is small lightweight and able to do all you need it to. Its integrated graphics will be able to play light games without issue. It has a fairly decent battery life so you won't have to bring a charger everywhere. Build wise most laptops in this price range have a similar build quality but as you should be able to get a couple of decent years out of it. It also has 2-in-1 13.3 FHD Ryzen 5 2500U 8GB DDR4 256GB SSD ,0.0,0.936,0.064,0.5423,1
go5jox,SuggestALaptop,Hey if I remember correctly the G5 SE was also meant to ship with a Ryzen 9 option as well. But bear in mind you're getting the same number of threads just slightly higher clock speeds. Also note that it has 2 battery configurations. On the other hand the G14 does have a lighter and smaller chassis. Performance in games should be similar a quick search shows me 70fps on shadow of the tomb raider on 1080p ultra for both . If you're doing machine learning you would benefit from CUDA on the RTX 2060 though there are packages on Linux for non-nvidia gpu acceleration. Finally quite obviously you have 14 vs 15.6 and that's the main thing do you want portability or a bigger screen? Unless you have a monitor in which case I'd go for the G14.,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.836,1
go5jox,SuggestALaptop,I'd recommend a full AMD setup. In some tests the 4800H is quicker than the 4900HS because of SmartShift. The full AMD system is able to boost the 4800H more than if it were paired with an Nvidia gpu. Wait for a 4900HS w/ 5700M. Or wait a year and get the 5000 series.,0.0,0.904,0.096,0.6369,1
go5jox,SuggestALaptop,The G14 is probably going to be better for everyone other than better performance it’s battery life is wayyy better than the dell. No webcam seems like a small tradeoff to me you can use an external one or use your phone as the webcam with the right app.,0.039,0.762,0.199,0.8402,1
go9f9l,SuggestALaptop,Have a look at the MSI GF63 Thin 9SCX-005 it should be able to give you the performance that you need for a fair price.

go9f9l,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'd go with the MSI GF65 Thin since it is on sale for a great price currently. You get a 4-core i5 processor RTX 2060 graphics and a 1080p 15.6 120Hz IPS display. This combination should be great for those games as well as music production. RAM and storage are both upgradable.,0.0,0.82,0.18,0.8834,1

go4dvn,SuggestALaptop,I suggest this premium HP 15 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer the leader in the CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1069 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD.

It should be fine for general use and light games.,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.6808,1
go86dp,SuggestALaptop,I suggest this premium HP 15 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer the leader in the CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1069 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not to skimp on the screen and wifi on any of these configs. Trust me. ,0.039,0.861,0.1,0.9283,1
go86dp,SuggestALaptop,Since the laptop is for kids you might want to go low budget but still able to do everything.

go1ght,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer the leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen and being riddled with security vulnerabilities. They also are extremely anti consumer and offer minimum refreshes over and over to their chips while charging stupid high prices. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-11 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a professional environment.

go7ehl,SuggestALaptop,It is currently out of stock and being overpriced so If you are not in a rush I would recommend this Acer Aspire 5 because of the following It offers great value for money since it comes with 8 GB RAM and 256GB SSD. It comes with 10th Gen i5 quad core CPU. Slim sleek. The lid of the device has a matte finish on its aluminum material. On the other side the plastic material on the rest of the chassis is retained. Its lid cannot be opened with a single hand. On the bright side it is sturdy and prone to flexes. Moreover we see an upgrade in the hinge department that leaves them a lot stronger than before. The narrow-bezel design offers more real estate for amazing images. Crisp true-to-life colors come alive on a 15.6” Full HD IPS display with Acer Color Intelligence. Battery life advertised Up to 9.5-hours Battery Life. you can upgrade RAM up to 12GB. Comes with a range of ports including USB 3.1 Type C Gen 1 port 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports USB 2.0 port and HDMI port. Here is a more detailed review of the Acer Aspire 5 under 500 If you prefer 2 in 1 and can push your budget a little higher then I would recommend this Lenovo Yoga 720 because it comes with everything you need 8th generation i5 quad core CPU 8GB of ram good SSD storage of 256GB for faster boot up and loading 13.3 inch Full HD IPS touch screen high build quality backlit keyboard supports pen and thunderbolt port. I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review so here it goes It has an IPS panel with very stable viewing angles. Therefore the screen content is legible from every position. Under the open sky the device can only be used when the sun does not shine too brightly and even then the reflective surface of the display can negatively impact the experience. Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles. It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3. Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming. Minimal bloat-ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate The body is sturdy and feels premium. also please check out this article about best 2 in laptops Due to the Virus a lot of laptops are being overpriced so make sure to check this list of overpriced laptops before you buy any laptop at the moment.,0.01,0.867,0.123,0.9938,1

For gaming the A15 might not have too many issues with the bad color accuracy but you'll get more frames from the 2060. If you don't need the max fps and want the CPU horsepower and are casually gaming I would suggest the Dell. If the panel was better on the A15 it would be a no brainer but the reviews have the panel quality not to be the best. Also consider battery life the A15 has more going for it but the panel is something you use all the time. The Dell has worse battery but better build quality.,0.08,0.766,0.153,0.8719,1

go1hs0,SuggestALaptop,I have a recommendation that although it has a touch screen you can simply turn off the functionality if you like. If you are open to it I think it's perfect for your use case. I suggest this premium HP 15 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer the leader in the CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1069 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD. Remember not to skimp on the screen and wifi on any of these configs. Trust me. ,0.034,0.863,0.103,0.9499,1

gnyzk3,SuggestALaptop,The Spectre is definitely the better choice if you need to heavy video edit because of the discrete graphics card. I typically suggest the envy for people who don't need tons of GPU power but in this case a GPU is useful for heavier video editing. The only downside for the Spectre is 4K Screen will KILL battery life and the price is tremendously overpriced. If you are open to something a bit different I know it's not conventional but the G14 is a thin and light gaming notebook that doesn't look too gamery but is over twice the performance of the Spectre with 8-10 hour battery. It shreds in productivity tasks and since you use an external monitor for the most part this much power in a small formfactor might be perfect for you. It's also like 3.4 pounds so it's a little 8 core/16 thread powerhouse in a small package. Just a thought! I know there are more professional looking machines out there but for 1449 I think it's worth a look. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer the leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen and being riddled with security vulnerabilities. They also are extremely anti consumer and offer minimum refreshes over and over to their chips while charging stupid high prices. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-11 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a professional environment. It comes with an 8 Core/16 thread AMD Ryzen 9 4900H 16GB RAM expandable 1TB SSD expandable Intel Wifi 6 card RTX 2060 Pantone calibrated 120HZ 1080pscreen 1449 brand new.

gnyzk3,SuggestALaptop,Hey Maybe this comparison will help you make a decision HP Envy X360 15 vs HP Spectre x360 15t From my point of view it's not just the power difference between Envy and Spectre it's also build quality. Envy is not on the same level as the Spectre. To keep things short if I had to choose one for a long period of time I'd go with the Spectre. Hope I helped!,0.088,0.838,0.074,0.1511,1

go1d4j,SuggestALaptop,Hey I see that you got some good feedback from a Tongfang GK5CP6Z Mech 15 user and you should know that the one you want to get is a little bit different. The biggest difference is that the Tongfang QC7 MAG-15 comes undervolted from the beginning so you won't have to do that - you'll have excellent thermals right from the start plus It has much better battery life you can expect over 7H but it does get loud under heavy load. Here's a comparison between these two Tongfang QC7 MAG-15 vs Tongfang GK5CP6Z Mech 15 maybe it will help you make a decision. Hope I helped!,0.0,0.862,0.138,0.92,1
go1d4j,SuggestALaptop,I have a G2-mech 15 which I’m assuming is similar. Fan speed and noise for me for typical use is fine and would be appropriate for a classroom setting. However it does get hot and max out temps around 90C under heavy load gaming. My screen failed and needed to be replaced just after my one year warranty ran out which i suspect was just from heat cooking internal components. After replacing screen the issue appeared again but intermittently. I was able to undervolt my cpu and gpu to lower temps significantly and the issue has subsided. I also game with the fan maxed out which is pretty loud. Max temps were 90C pre undervolt and 75-80C now.,0.054,0.862,0.085,0.5789,1
go1d4j,SuggestALaptop,Are you referring to this Eluktronics MAG-15 Slim ?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
go1d4j,SuggestALaptop,I have the Eluktronics MAG-15 with 2070 max-q gpu option I bought it when it was released. It has a button for 3 settings power saver gaming and gaming eluktroboost. It also let's you choose between different fan options for each power setting. In the power saver mode there's near-zero fan noise I don't notice it at all. Now when you have either of the gaming power settings on and load up an intensive game the fans ramp up for sure. That being said there's not many options out there that have comparable weight/size that do not make noise when put under load with the same/similar performance. The laptop never overheats it always stays at a normal temperature. It is a great laptop for taking to class because of it's light weight and size. it's less than five pounds which is great. Also since the bezels are quite thin it's footprint is much smaller than other 15.6 in screen laptops I've had in the past which makes it easy to put in/out of a backpack. Also the battery life is great it will last at least a couple of hours if you're gaming. But for just light web browsing/homework assignments/notes it will last around 9 hours which is great if you're going to be in class/on campus for several hours. The power brick is 230w and a pretty big pain if you need to carry it with you but I usually don't need to because the battery life is very good.,0.008,0.899,0.093,0.9541,1

gnuq7o,SuggestALaptop,I’m looking for a laptop for similar purposes with a similar price range. Have you taken a look at the IdeaPad 5? You can find them for around 500 US and it’s looks like a nice laptop. The only problem is I keep seeing a guy/girl around here naked Chewy718 that is pushing AMD chips HARD.

go12lg,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we can find him a viable general use and light gaming device. I recommend the ASUS M409 It comes with a 4-core Ryzen 5 processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 display.

gnwxl1,SuggestALaptop,It's a good laptop but I have a better and newer suggestion if you can do 14 gaming and not have the laptop look too gamery. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer the leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 8-11 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a professional environment. It comes with an 3Ghz 6 Core/12Thread AMD Ryzen 4600H 8GB RAM expandable 512GB SSD GTX 1650 1030 Here are some reviews to help you ,0.02,0.885,0.095,0.882,1
go0p9k,SuggestALaptop,Hey Your budget is more than enough for your needs. Any modern laptop with a good display and a dedicated graphics card would be more than enough.

If you're willing to buy certified refurbished models Dell Outlet sells good premium laptops refurbished for a great deal. Also there's 15% student discount off the shown price.

gnt4k9,SuggestALaptop,If you are willing to wait you should. The game keeps changing faster and although 10th gen intel laptops already catching shores of consumer market that headstart is the only thing which will keep intel afloat this season as the new 4000 series by AMD is superior due to 7nm process and this ensures lower power consumption which is the most desirable feature for a laptop and besides the benchmarks tell us the performance is the real rockstar more than the lower average TDP. AMD has announced 4000 series in January but the ongoing festival is causing delays to release of products. For all I care it is more time for the designers to optimize designs and builds. So to conclude my suggestion would be to wait and watch. Also new processors while looking very good on paper real world performance it brings to the table is to be considered when making a purchase that is done by reviewers thus keep a watch over reviews of the soon to come AMD laptops.,0.017,0.868,0.115,0.964,1

gnprdp,SuggestALaptop,If you want a laptop with almost MacBook level build quality that performs almost double the performance of MacBooks pros for a cheap price I suggest this premium HP 15 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer the leader in the CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1069 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD.

gnadgo,SuggestALaptop,Recently I did a massive amount of research for a new laptop. I’m a total gear-head so everything I get has to be inspected down to the detail to determine if it’s worth quite a lot of my money. I discovered that the best options for a premium laptop around the 1000 mark are • ⁠HP Envy you can find models for easily under your price point as well as some powerful 2in1s. Some models include dedicated a graphics card nvidia mx250 for gaming and up to 16gb ram for heavy workload. I purchased this one off of Amazon for 1099. • ⁠Dell XPS tend to be a bit more pricey but they have carbon fiber finishes that feel like heaven. Some models include the same dedicated graphics as above • Asus Zenbook mixed reviews for the new touchpad with an app interface/numberpad but the older versions pack the same hardware for less Hopefully you can find your answer in any of these three choices there’s a ton of different specs you can opt for depending on your needs for both.,0.008,0.842,0.15,0.9713,1

It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer the leader in the CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1069 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD.

gnhaso,SuggestALaptop,Hey Maybe this comparison will help you make a decision Dell Gaming G5 15 5590 vs Acer Predator Helios 300 15 vs Lenovo Ideapad Legion Y540-15 From my point of view G5 has the best peripheral port selection and build quality and Helios has the best thermals.

Keyboard is great quiet and have a nice feel. Keyboard has a numpad but narrower than the rest of the keyboard and the arrow buttons shifted.

Further as you might know Lenovo have recently announced that they are officially supporting Fedora on some thinkpads in future by extension most linux distros . All in all IMHO the best option could be X1 Carbon Gen 8 it fits pretty much all your requirements and as usual they are brilliant to type on.

Plastic Aluminium lid weight 4.8 lbs just over 1 inch thick. Comes with 2X8 DDR4 3200mhz and space for 2x NVMe drivers You can get the additional 2.5 bay but that means a smaller battery .

gnokn0,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer the leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen and being riddled with security vulnerabilities. They also are extremely anti consumer and offer minimum refreshes over and over to their chips while charging stupid high prices.

gnk0rh,SuggestALaptop,I would look into something that has the new AMD Ryzen chips that just launched. You get better performance more cores better battery life better gaming better security and cheaper than the Intel counterparts. The iGPU in these chips are able to play many titles at 1080p medium. It's extremely capable for a integrated GPU more or less the performance of an entry level discrete graphics card. Don't buy and Intel chip with Intel's UHD iGPU. It's basically unusable for gaming.

gnk0rh,SuggestALaptop,If you prefer a traditional laptop then I would recommend this Acer Swift 3 because of the following The casing made of brushed aluminum and looks very premium which matches your requirements since you prefer a reliable build quality. The keyboard is a chiclet keyboard typing on it feels spongy but you get used to it quickly. Drag and drop sometimes doesn't work as intended but that is easily fixed with software. Screen is glossy Full HD IPS with very good viewing angles the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive . The main and maybe only con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get as it is not usable in direct sunlight. Has very good heat management and it doesn't throttle. Speakers provide very clear sounds and the maximum volume is pretty loud. Battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light to medium usage.

For a portable 15-inch laptop I'd give this one a chance MSI Prestige 15 A10 - it's a very light 15-inch laptop that has a lot of power excellent display and great battery life. For 1400 you're getting a 15W six-core processor GTX 1650 Max-Q graphics bright display PCIe SSD over 9H battery life 16 GB RAM very good peripheral port selection 2 X USB 3.1 2 X USB-C 3.1 MicroSD card reader Thunderbolt and a Backlit Chiclet keyboard. Prestige is MSI's business-grade laptop so build quality should not be a problem. It has a metal chassis USB-C charging and some upgrade options. For similar laptops you can check out this search engine I have searched only for business-grade laptops. You can see and change the search parameters using the Refine results button in the upper-left part of the search results page. You can also click on the laptops for more information.

gneswo,SuggestALaptop,I'm in NYC! CONGRATS on NYU. Don't go to bar 13 or 13th step If you are willing to go down in screen size to 13.3 I 100% recommend the laptop listed below. I think it's worth the trade off but you can choose. If you want a laptop with almost MacBook level build quality that performs almost double the performance of MacBooks pros for a cheap price I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer the leader in the CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light with 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and make sure to get the Intel wifi 6 card.

gnmc9p,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure that we find a solid gaming laptop for an affordable price. I recommend the ASUS TUF FX505DU It comes with a 4-core Ryzen 7 processor GTX 1660 Ti graphics and a 1080p 15.6 60Hz IPS display. This combination can run modern games at high-ultra settings at 1080p.

The ASUS ROG Zephyrus G15 has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside GTX 1660 Ti MQ graphics which can easily handle modern games at high settings 1080p. The Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has the offer for the price. The 74Wh battery should net around 4-5 hours for light use.

Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer the leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen and being riddled with security vulnerabilities. They also are extremely anti consumer and offer minimum refreshes over and over to their chips while charging stupid high prices.

Screen Size 15.3 inches Processor Intel Core i5-9300H Graphics NVIDIA GTX 1650 RAM 8 GB Storage Type 512 SSD This laptop has a clean and professional so you can take it anywhere without sticking out as a gamer. It has a fair amount of ports so you won't have to bring a dongle to attach what you need. Its has adequate power to gaming and manage productivity tasks such as editing CAD work smoothly.

gnigkz,SuggestALaptop,If you want a laptop with almost MacBook level build quality that performs almost double the performance of MacBooks pros for a cheap price I suggest this premium HP 15 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer the leader in the CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 6core or 4700U 8 core RAM- 16GB RAM upgradable you can buy the 8GB and upgrade yourself for more savings Screen- 15 1080p-DO NOT BUY the default 250nit screen. Get the 400 nit brightness option. 250nit is too dim. SSD- 256GB should be minimum but 512GB is an option if you wish. Wifi card- DO NOT BUY REALTEK- bump it up to a Intel wifi 6 card. Realtek is terrible Total should be around 929 for the 6 core 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD 1069 for the 8 core 4700U and 16GB RAM 256GB SSD.

Audio delay- would be 3 secs when I watched videos idk if you've faced that if you do I fixed it by editing some registry files. 2. Random screen blackouts they barely happen anymore and ppl online said it was a common issue for hp laptops so left it at that. 3. Keyboard randompy stops recieving input still gotta research that. 4. Another issue I faced is the integrated vega graphics using 2GB of RAM haven't been able to fix that which lead me to needing to upgrade to 2 8GB RAM. I had 2 4. If you face this issue the RAM will constantly be at like 80-90% usage while gaming which lead even my least demanding games to lag and I had to avoid playing till I upgraded the RAM. So idk if every pavilion user experiences these problems but based on my research online some do so yeah. Other than that my laptop doesn't overheat literally but get a cooler asap if you haven't already since tha fan is located on the bottom so that will cause your laptop to overheat but with a cooler under it it's great.

They are not bad machines just that you should not expect them to last very long. If you can push your budget a little these could be alternatives search engine - with these you'll have a much better gaming experience the 150 extra would be worth it.

gng8g3,SuggestALaptop,Hey If you're looking for build quality Aspire and Pavilion are not the best choices. I'd go for one of these Legion Y7000 or Dell G3 - both come with an I5 processor and GTX 1650 so you won't have to worry about thermals and both have 4H battery life and non-gaming looks.

gnbopf,SuggestALaptop,If you can find this thing in stock I would also suggest looking at the Asus A15 with the new Ryzen 7 4800H 2 cores more than the i7-9750H although not a big deal in games and the 1660ti in here is about as good as you'll find for 1K.

Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer the leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen and being riddled with security vulnerabilities. They also are extremely anti consumer and offer minimum refreshes over and over to their chips while charging stupid high prices.

It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Intel is no longer the leader in the CPU space and they are offering less performance for more money. Don't waste your money on Intel anymore. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light with 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and make sure to get the Intel wifi 6 card.

The casing made of brushed aluminum and looks very premium. The keyboard is a chiclet keyboard typing on it feels spongy but you get used to it quickly. Drag and drop sometimes doesn't work as intended but that is easily fixed with software. Screen is glossy Full HD IPS with very good viewing angles the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive . The main and maybe only con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get as it is not usable in direct sunlight. Has very good heat management and it doesn't throttle. Speakers provide very clear sounds and the maximum volume is pretty loud. Battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light to medium usage.

gndryw,SuggestALaptop,Hi for both a good display and good performance within budget I'd go with the Acer Predator Helios 300 It is a very well known and well reviewed device. It comes with a 4-core i5 processor GTX 1660 Ti graphics and a 1080p 15.6 120Hz IPS display. This combination can run modern games as well as photo editing well. The display should have 90% sRGB coverage.,0.0,0.785,0.215,0.9242,1
gn865y,SuggestALaptop,Only the laptop screen determines the 4k and refresh rate. An external screen will have its own color specification and refresh rate. Go to a store and try them out or at least something comparable. For editing you want to focus on RAM and CPU as opposed to video. Honestly the refresh rate is more for gaming but most laptops can't support the screen they come with. At high settings most mobile cards can not push 144hz last time I checked. Be sure you aren't just buying something that you can't utilize.,0.034,0.902,0.064,0.2065,1
gn865y,SuggestALaptop,If you're going to be using an external monitor then splurging for a 4k display on the laptop isn't worth the money and battery life cost and like the other comment says most mobile GPUs can't push above 100 fps on AAA titles anyway so a 144 or 300 Hz screen is a bit of a waste. The most important qualities I'd say are panel brightness and color accuracy so that you don't end up looking at a shit display every time you use your laptop - but again if you're using external monitors then you don't need the absolute best display on the laptop itself per se,0.05,0.853,0.098,0.7479,1
gn865y,SuggestALaptop,The choice really depends on what you are doing. If you are a gamer the high refresh rate panel will be a plus IF you have a graphics card that supports the high refresh rate. And even then most of the time you won’t really notice the difference. On the other hand you will notice the 4K resolution all the time and if you have OLED you will love the color saturation. So for gaming - get 1080p or 1440p and high refresh rate For photo work - get 4k OLED For lots of coding - get 4K LCD,0.0,0.901,0.099,0.872,1

Intel is also less secure due to vulnerabilities and more expensive Don't buy Intel anymore they are extremely anti consumer and AMD is dominating them in performance across all segments while being Cheaper. Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles if you wanted to play.

gn4qwz,SuggestALaptop,I would honestly look into the Dell Latitude or Lenovo IdeaPad if your looking for something along these lines.

Granted the spec will be like Intel i3 with 2 cores 128 gb storage 8 gb of ram But again depending on the tasks your doing it shouldn't be too worry some. Sounds like she'll use Microsoft office and the internet and that's it. As long as shell not be doing like photo editing with Photoshop and stuff she'll be fine. Otherwise I would aim for something used or refurbished. U might be able to find a 2015 MacBook pro for 550. You can still run Microsoft office on that. Eh I mean.

gn6fmx,SuggestALaptop,I don't know that much myself but from what I've gathered recently looking to buy one myself a very important metric is screen quality. It's the thing you're going to be staring at all the time so be sure to get a decent one especially because that's where budget laptops tend to cut corners. Make sure your brightness is at least 300 nits Make sure it's not a TN screen Get a decent color gamut and accuracy 70% or better I believe Most other things are dependent on your specific needs. Good luck!,0.024,0.717,0.259,0.9787,1
gn6fmx,SuggestALaptop,Laptops are usually alot about balance. Sure 4k is nice but your battery will suffer. A 2080 is nice but your battery will suffer. Screen- screen quality should be an IPS screen with 300nit and above being acceptable. As color accurate as possible. 4K screens are pretty but pull too much battery power so it's not usually worth it in such a small screen. 1080p is fine with 60hz if you are not gaming. CPU- Get a capable CPU. AMD Ryzen offers 8 cores for the same power usage as Intel's 4 cores? Get the Ryzen. RAM- 8GB MINIMUM preferably in a dual channel configuration. This will give more bandwidth from the RAM to the CPU. 16GB or above is ideal. GPU- most gamers love high framerates for smooth gameplay especially in first person shooters.amd and Intel both have integrated graphics which are tiny chips that can run the display and play games. At least the Vega iGPU can game. The Intel iGPU is a joke you can't game for the most part. Those are low powered basic iGPU. Dedicated GPU are additional bigger graphics chips that are more powerful and push alot of frames. For gamers and content creatovideo editors. A dedicated GPU is a must because the software uses the graphics card to help do the work. If you don't game hard or don't due heavy video editing you can get by with an integrated GPU. Storage laptops should only have SSDs nowadays. HDD have mechanical moving parts and use alot more power to make those parts move than an SSD which is just a chip. Typically 256GB should be the minimum. Build quality- this is up to the consumer typically you want a metal or aluminum body as it's more sturdy but usually more expensive. Plastic sturdy laptop chassis can work too but will feel cheaper BUT they are more cost effective. Some users care about the plastic feeling? Others not but either way it should be sturdy and not flex too much. Ports- should have as many ports as they can give you usually high end models have multiple USBC or thunderbolt ports but medium ones are now using USBC along with USB A and HDMI ports. Try to have at least 1 USBC and 1 USBA 3.1 and up port.,0.033,0.812,0.155,0.9943,1

gn69yo,SuggestALaptop,The G14 is indeed a great option for your use case. It's below 2kg and it's small which is great for carrying it around on campus. It's insanely powerful and would definitely handle any 3D modelling software Solidworks etc or heavy programs like Android Studio. One thing I would note though is depending on the availability of computers in your university you might not need such a powerful laptop especially since you're not gaming. What I've seen from my engineering studies is that despite my laptop being able to run most of the needed programs I still end up doing all the relevant work on campus computers. Meaning that if I was to start uni now I would opt for a thin 13-14 laptop with ideally an AMD Ryzen 7 4800U or 4700U processor 4800U 8 cores/16 threads vs. 4700U 8 cores /8 threads and skip any unnecessary heat from a discrete Nvidia graphics card. This processor is still plenty fast for all daily uses and coding. Lastly if you do decide you want to be able to carry out all work on your laptop and are sure you won't be doing heavy gaming I think the Quadro T-series graphics cards are more optimised to work with professional/engineering software. I don't know much about that though so you should look around. EDIT Clarification on Ryzen -U processors,0.0,0.878,0.122,0.9785,1

gn3vy4,SuggestALaptop,I've heard that this is a really good gaming laptop that should last you a long time as Lenovo has pretty good build quality and the Legion is reasonably priced for the specs. Throttling is when your laptop basically forces the CPU to slow down to conserve battery and keep the laptop cool as well as keep the laptop as quiet as possible. Throttling issues happen when the laptop unsuccessfully throttles causing a loss in performance or does it too much that it's noticeable and doesn't offer a good experience. Most reviews don't say anything about throttling issues but if you hear a lot about it then I would say that it's not a great thing to have in a laptop so steer clear. As far as the fans go I'm pretty sure reviewers said that the fans would turn on noticeably for short periods of time but then would stay quiet for the most part so I guess you could say it's like a regular laptop for today's standards.

It does have an extra hard drive slot though so you can toss another one for more storage in without much hassle Dave 2D on YouTube did a pretty good review on their differences and I feel like it has a more professional look. Also the thermals/fans are better on the y540 Also for throttling you can do this thing called undervolting which really helps with thermals with at no real detriment to the performance. My buddy has one with the 2060 and with throttlestop program used for undervolting he has no throttle or performance issues.

You can easily get a laptop with the newest generation of processors and an rtx2070 which will pretty much run any game at full settings right now. Brand-wise I would suggest an MSI GP65 if you prefer a 17 inch search for the GP75 or MSI GS66 if you want something thin and light although this has a downgraded GPU The Acer Predator line up also has some great options and are usually very highly regarded but they generally cost more for what you are getting.

Don't buy Intel anymore they are extremely anti consumer and are also less secure due to vulnerabilities and more expensive. AMD is dominating them in performance across all segments while being Cheaper. Ryzen also have a integrated graphics chip that makes gaming very doable at 1080p medium and 1080p high in some titles if you wanted to game you have the option.

Screen is glossy Full HD IPS with very good viewing angles the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive . The main and maybe only con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get as it is not usable in direct sunlight. Has very good heat management and it doesn't throttle. Speakers provide very clear sounds and the maximum volume is pretty loud. Battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light to medium usage.

gn2gxa,SuggestALaptop,Really depends on what you’re looking for. The processor is going to be your main workhorse for most tasks. The i5/Ryzen 5 should be good for the most part but if you’re doing more intensive stuff and want to future proof yourself the i7/Ryzen 7 would be a better choice. Also for Ryzen I would definitely get the 4000 series huge step up from the 3000 series. Intel hasn’t really changed much since the 8th gen currently in 10th GPU is what you’re going to need for games or any graphic intensive stuff. If you’re really trying to game I would look at the 1660ti minimum and the RTX series 2060-2060 would all run current AAA games at a good frame rate. If yo don’t need that much gaming power then maybe a q640 or 1050 would be good or lower if it’s just basic games you want to run. Most dedicated GPUs will be able to run most creative software so you could get a less powerful one than I listed above. although if it gets more intensive you may need a better GPU like one for the games Neither the GPU or CPU can be upgraded on laptops save for like the Alienware a51 which runs for like 4k Ram is going to be crucial in order to run intensive games and more intensive software/big data sets. You could get away with 8 but I would recommend at least 16 to give yourself some wiggle room and future proof yourself. Dual channel ram 2 stocks gives better performance than single channel so be on the lookout for that when purchasing. Ram is relatively cheap though so if you find a steal of a deal for a laptop without your desired amount of ram you can get 2 8gb sticks of ram for like 70 and it’s easy to upgrade. Also cheaper for you to do yourself than it is to upgrade Storage is important for speed too. NVMe is the fastest. SSd still fast but not quite as fast as the NVMe. HDD is slow and I would recommend against it unless your laptop also has a ssd that it can use for your operating system so it boots up quick. A lot of laptops have extra storage bays though and storage is also cheap 1tb SSD can be found for around 100 little more or less depending on brand. Screen is the last real important conponent and it’s important because you’re going to be staring at it all the time. 1080p is pretty much minimum and you can go up to 1440p if your budget allows. 4K is cool too but I feel that 4K and even 1440p isn’t that important on a laptop because the screens are pretty small. 1440p would be great to have though although it may be pricier than it’s worth. Higher resolutions also drain your battery faster too so keep that in mind. Next is screen refresh. 60hz is ok if you get a lower end graphics card as you might not push that boundary much anyway. I would recommend a 120 or 144hz screen instead though as it makes your display look great and you can play less intensive games at higher fame rates and high end games as well if the GPU is strong enough. Battery life isn’t always great on gaming laptops but most manufacturers post the typical battery life so you can see what you prefer. I like to have more battery in case I’m not near an outlet but if you want to game you won’t really be able to on battery for more than an hour or 2 even with the high capacity battery laptops. Thermals are important but you can usually fix that with software and lotions run warm for the most part anyway compared to desktops. I would recommend getting a laptop with some fan control but that is pretty typica in gaming laptops and not so much on other types Then it’s pretty much preference. Metal builds last longer and are more premium. Keyboards aren’t necessarily subjective but it is still up to your preference. Most trackpads have the windows drovers so they’ll act pretty much the same but some are better than others. Pretty easy fix with a mouse though. Weight/form factor is whatever you want it to be.,0.015,0.777,0.208,0.9994,1

gmwgn8,SuggestALaptop,Hi I'm sure we can find you a low budget laptop that can run some light games. I recommend the Acer Swift 3 It comes with a 4-core i7 processor and MX150 graphics which should be just fine for general use as well as light gaming. It weighs around 3.3lbs and battery life is around 8 hours for light use.,0.034,0.795,0.17,0.7506,1
gmwgn8,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this Acer Swift 3 because of the following NVIDIA MX150 which is one of the best for this range but still not great for newer games Benchmark the same website to check the benchmarks of the other GPU from the right hand list and it will run Civ 7 smoothly. The casing made of brushed aluminum and looks very premium. The keyboard is a chiclet keyboard typing on it feels spongy but you get used to it quickly. Drag and drop sometimes doesn't work as intended but that is easily fixed with software. Screen is glossy Full HD IPS with very good viewing angles the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive . The main and maybe only con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get as it is not usable in direct sunlight. Has very good heat management and it doesn't throttle. Speakers provide very clear sounds and the maximum volume is pretty loud. Battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light to medium usage.

gmu6ed,SuggestALaptop,If you want a laptop with almost MacBook level build quality that performs almost double the performance of MacBooks pros for a cheap price I suggest this premium HP 2 in 1 X360 ENVY. It has the brand new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips that blow any Intel chips away right now. Look up reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. They have more performance better battery lower cost. It also has a very capable little GPU that can game at 1080p medium in most titles if you want to play games. You have many options in configurations but for a good balance a decent price configure it to this 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 4700u CPU yes that's right. 8 cores in a thin and light with 16GB RAM 256GB SSD and make sure to get the Intel wifi 6 card.

gmwkc5,SuggestALaptop,Hey Please keep in mind that low-budget laptops usually do not have the best build quality or reliability. They are not bad machines just that you should not expect them to last very long. With that in mind here you can see some options search engine You can see and change the search parameters using the Refine results button in the upper-left part of the search results page. You can also click on the laptops for more information. I don't have a lot of results because I've searched for laptops that have at least a Full HD display. This could be a budget-friendly option Acer Spin 1 with a dual-core processor Full HD LED IPS display EMMC for storage 4GB RAM soldered and a decent peripheral port selection 1 X USB 2.0 1 X USB 3.0 MicroSD card reader. I'd recommend trying to increase your budget this laptop will be good only for light browsing and word.,0.022,0.896,0.082,0.8167,1
gmw5ai,SuggestALaptop,Since she doesn't need any heavy use cases. I recommend this for 449 4 core 8 Thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500U 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Vega iGPU can game if she wanted to 14 1080p screen. 449 brand new ,0.0,0.932,0.068,0.3612,1

gmw5ai,SuggestALaptop,Hi I agree with the other response. I recommend the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 for her. It comes with a 4-core Ryzen 5 processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 display. It should handle general use tasks and school work just fine on a low budget.,0.046,0.806,0.148,0.5719,1

gmw5ai,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this off brand from Walmart don't know much about the brand but it offers great value for money for this screen size like another redditor said this is the poor man LG gram because of how lightweight it is at 2.55 lbs.

gn08tt,SuggestALaptop,Hi if you cn wait for it to come back into stock I recommend the new Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14 It comes with an 8-core Ryzen 7 processor 16 GB RAM a 512 GB SSD and a 1080p 14 display. This combination should be fine for your uses. I made a full review on the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14” which you can view here ,0.0,0.926,0.074,0.5106,1
gn08tt,SuggestALaptop,I would look into the new AMD Ryzen 4000 series chips as they offer more performance for cheaper price and better battery than anything Intel can offer. Intel is offering 4 cores for the same price AMD is offering 6. Configure this on lenovos website 6 core AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 16GB RAM 256GB SSD VEGA iGPU With that config it's 644.99 ,0.0,0.952,0.048,0.4404,1
gn3nip,SuggestALaptop,For 100 I’d say go for it. Adding it on a new one is 200-250 so 100 is a good deal and gives you a good performance bump for the price at 200 I’d skip it .,0.0,0.83,0.17,0.7451,1
gmr3rr,SuggestALaptop,Hey That's the old Helios and that one had some thermal issues although I doubt it has problems with the I5 processor. In this case I'd go with the Nitro - Acer Aspire Nitro 5 15 you'll have slightly better processor performance and a much better graphics card. With the I5 you won't have to worry about overheating. Hope I helped!,0.079,0.757,0.164,0.682,1

gmr3rr,SuggestALaptop,9th gen with 1650 is better in every way on paper but Thermals and power draw being one huge factor certain models are tricky. Screen wont be quite as nice as the predator but that's fine. You can play any modern game on that setup on at least high settings. They will both burn your legs when on your lap.,0.026,0.737,0.236,0.9333,1
gmx87g,SuggestALaptop,Hi currently I'd go with the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G15 which supports VR. It has an incredible 8-core Ryzen 7 processor alongside RTX 2060 MQ graphics which can easily handle modern games at high-ultra settings 1080p. The Ryzen 7 processor is much stronger than what Intel has the offer for the price. The 74Wh battery should net around 4-5 hours for light use.,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.7579,1
gmx87g,SuggestALaptop,for gaming at this price range I would advise you to check this laptops laptop name Eluktronics MAX-15 --- --- CPU Octa core 10th Gen I7-10750H GPU RTX 2060 Screen 144Hz 15.6 FHD IPS Ram 16 GB SSD 512 GB HDD 0 Weight 3.85 Lbs.

gmx87g,SuggestALaptop,I would recommend this Eluktronics MAG-15 Slim because of the following It comes with GTX 1660Ti GPU You can check the below link to see how the GTX 1660Ti GPU scroll down for the FPs and settings expected or ctrl f then type the name of your game . Developed by intel with corporation with different laptop brands. According to Dave2D it has great battery life up to 7 hours with regular usage . Very light for a gaming laptop at 4.15 lbs built with Magnesium alloyed all over The speaker gril is in the bottom of the laptop 3 USB A Thunderbolt 3 SD card reader and HDMI port.

gmx87g,SuggestALaptop,The last Gen Ryzen 3550H and 3750H were meh but good if you got it at a cheap price. I would look into the new Ryzen CPUs that just dropped. They have more cores run cooler and more power effecient than Intel chips. They are also cheaper. Don't buy Intel CPUs anymore they are no longer the leader and offer fewer cores while using more power than Ryzen. The G14 it's literally the smallest thinnest and lightest powerful 14 inch laptop. With 10-13 hour battery life. It also doesn't look all gamery so it can be used in a professional environment. It comes with an 8 Core/16 thread AMD Ryzen 9 4900H 16GB RAM expandable 1TB SSD expandable Intel Wifi 6 card RTX 2060 Pantone calibrated 120HZ 1080pscreen 1449 brand new.

gqb594,mac,Fun story about those remotes I worked in a college IT department and kept getting called down to a classroom for an issue with the classroom lighting system. The lights could be turned on and off with a touch panel on the “smart cart” combination of computer document camera dvd/vcr and for some reason the lights would turn on and off in the middle of class. No other room had ever had that problem. No one could figure out what was going on until one of our interns realized that the classroom was the only one with a Mac. We decided to try to investigate other things that might be different about that room. Our intern came to my office one day and said “Hey I know this is going to sound crazy but the lighting issue is caused by this Mac remote.” Sure enough that remote used the same signal that the touch panel used to control the lights. Mystery solved. We threw that damn thing in the garbage. TLDR That Mac remote was interfering with our classroom lighting system.,0.056,0.902,0.042,-0.1406,-1

gqvtfs,mac,Hmmm there are ways you could do that but I think it would over-complicate things for no real gain.

gqvovb,mac,For reference Catalina runs on 2012 MacBook Airs so from that one could expect upgrades for at least 7-8 years after release. There’s a much rumored ARM transition being discussed and if it’s a full transition it could cut that lifespan short by a year or two. But getting rid of Intel entirely doesn’t seem likely since there aren’t exactly ARM equivalents to Mac Pro and iMac Pro CPUs. So I think you’ll get a minimum of 3 more years of updates your machine but likely more.,0.019,0.981,0.0,-0.1406,-1
gqvovb,mac,Depending on what you use it for it might give you good service even after the OS stops getting updates. I have a 2012 Mac Pro that stops at Mojave.

It still has uses besides just being fun and running old games. It’s better although slower than my newer Macs at certain tasks.

The SSD can be upgraded up to 1TB but that’s a proprietary Apple SSD and isn’t cheap. There are adapters to make nvme drives fit the socket but I wouldn’t trust them. The 15” 2015 with dedicated GPU might be a good options for better graphics but I wouldn’t consider it much of a gaming machine.

A 15” retina is quite a bit bigger and heavier. If you want something for gaming I recommend a windows machine.,0.008,0.766,0.226,0.9862,1
gqpvsn,mac,For sure the 15” versions would handle the Sims in a breeze... apparently even the new 13” ones can handle games like fortnight on mid graphics settings. There’s a reviewer on Youtube that demonstrates this. I guess the issue is you won’t get much for a AIR with 256 GB... and you would have to get a fairly recent Pro... 2017 definitely works well as I have one and can tell. I play a bit not too much but certifications have no issues... 2015 should too ... Youtube may be your friend for finding out,0.029,0.837,0.134,0.7906,1

gqh4rz,mac,I gotcha about saving money. I went with the 16GB and then returned it after I found out that Final Cut Pro needs 32GB for optimal performance. Depends on your use case. Do you need an i9? You'll need to list your use case for anyone to give you proper advice.,0.042,0.909,0.049,0.1027,1
gqh4rz,mac,To add to everyone else’s comments which I agree with you are doing Uni work? Does that mean Safari web browsing Microsoft Word PDF reading and annotation? If so then any computer can do that. 8GB RAM is enough but I would keep it safe at 16GB RAM. If you’re pushing a lot of data video data or RAW photo data and you do it daily then you’ll want 32GB RAM. 16GB is enough but 32GB will give your CPU more overhead for those kinds of tasks. If you only do the occasional photo or video project 16GB is enough. If you do only occasional video/photo projects the 6-core i7 is enough. Basically start with the the base configuration i7/16GB RAM/512GB/Storage/5300 GPU. This is overkill for Uni work but a fine computer none the less.

gqi2a7,mac,A common misconception is that the MBA has the better processor for being 10th gen. This is because of Intel's horrible branding. The MacBook Air uses Intel's low power Y-series chips that run at 7W-15W and lower clocks. The MacBook Pro although they are 8th gen use U-series chips that run at 15-25W and will outperform the 10th Gen Air except in Graphics performance where any 10th gen chip blows previous chips out of the water thanks to the new Gen11 GPU . Also thermals matter a lot in real world performance and a properly cooled 8th gen will outperform a 10th gen where the heatsink isn't connected to the fan.,0.067,0.853,0.079,0.1027,1

gqrki1,mac,I used to be anti-Apple like you mainly because of the price. But then my laptop an HP ProBook just became unusable too slow for my increasing needs . I had two options get a ThinkPad mobile workstation W/P Series or get a MBP. I almost ended up with a ThinkPad had it not been for some fuck-ups during order processing/delivery. Once I got my MBP a 15” 2014 model back in 2014 I understood what Apple computers are about. The build quality was stunning. The thermals were way better than those on my HP. And the OS was just out of this world. No weird ass Franken-interface no Windows features indexing Defender ... slowing things down. It supported both commercial software and shell scripts I wrote for Linux. Oh and when I needed to run Windows in a VM for my Windows-specific courses C Windows Administration my VM ran faster and quieter than the actual Windows boxes of my fellow students.

gqapld,mac,Hi First idea I've had similar issues with my mac having worse and worse wifi reception over the past 2-3 years. Turns out the flats around me are upgrading routers and wifi interference is getting worse as more people have powerful routers blasting wifi into my flat. Is your wifi network 2 4 or 5 ghz? If possible use a 5ghz network to avoid excessive interference. You can check this by holding alt and hovering over the wifi icon in the top right of your mac desktop. Here click open wireless diagnostics then when a window pops up go to the top left and click window. You should see an option to Scan. Click this and do a scan. How many networks do you see? If you sort by RSSI is your network showing the lowest negative number? -30 means better signal than -80 for example. Let me know! If you see networks here that have similar RSSI numbers to your network they're on the same channel and frequency then you might need to adjust your wifi through your router. My tactic is to narrow the channel width of my wifi if there's lots of interference. Say the default width is 40Mhz but this means that you might overlap with other wifi networks and get bad signal stability. Lower it to 20 Mhz and you'll lose some connection speed but gain stability. Second idea Not sure about the air but macbooks usually have wifi antennas in their displays with a small coax cable connecting the antenna to the logic board. This cable run through the hinge of the display and has a change to slowly degrade as you open/close your laptop. I'd unscrew the bottom of the laptop and see if it looks worn. I have similarly bad reception with my retina macbook. I have a few spots in the house where the wifi works great due to low interference narrow channel width I set up in my router. However if I go farther interference from other wifi networks will throw me off my wifi. Ultimate solution wire up. Get an ethernet cable and run it from your router to your desk and get an ethernet to mini-displayport or ethernet to thunderbolt adapter depending on which connector your air has .,0.099,0.849,0.052,-0.9595,-1
gqapld,mac,are you using a single router? or a mesh network? and is the house a single level multi level brick? as those can cause interference at longer ranges. while 5Ghz is a faster connection interference due to environmental factors can be more prevelent on 5ghz 2.4 has a little easier time going longer distance. the issue sound 2 fold. since you're having wifi connection issue with MULTIPLE devices you at least know its THE NETWORK and not your MBA for that issue. since you said yours was having trouble connecting to hotspots provided they were in close proximity you could have issues with wifi SETTINGS. x200B ,0.031,0.945,0.024,-0.186,-1
gq9dfk,mac,have you scanned the drive for errors? whenever I have a drive with errors happens every time I plug it into my ipad pro super frustrating it won’t show up on my mac but will on my windows laptop. not sure why but scan and fix usually solves it. this usually results in some data loss though so I’d back it up before you try this.,0.15,0.779,0.071,-0.5637,-1

gq7yv6,mac,I recently downgraded my 2011 iMac from High Sierra which was the highest it would go back to Mavericks. It came with OS X Lion back in the day but that was a little too out of date for me. Getting everything running on Mavericks certainly is a challenge but since it’s not my daily driver and the thing was gathering dust on my desk I’m pretty happy with the outcome. It’s flying as if it came right out of the box. And secretly I always loved the Mac UI before Yosemite came around and made everything flat ,0.0,0.821,0.179,0.965,1
gq7yv6,mac,If your Mac automatically downloaded El Capitan when you reinstalled it that means it probably came with El Capitan when it was new. What Mac do you have because you need a 2009 or above to run Sierra and High Sierra or a 2012 or above to run Mojave and Catalina. I've found a good website here that compares every single version of OS X or macOS from Snow Leopard up to Catalina. I'm running Catalina on my 2019 27 iMac and that's the OS it came with and it's ok but it's not the best version of macOS or OS X that I've used. People have had good and bad experiences saying that it's really buggy and it's not stable so I would avoid it if possible because Catalina doesn't support 32-bit apps and some stuff that probably worked before on El Capitan might not work on Catalina. My old MacBook Pro 15 Retina was running Mojave and I never upgraded to Catalina on that until I sold it in December last year to upgrade to an iMac and I've been using Catalina because it's the OS it came with and I haven't had too many problems with it. My MacBook Pro originally shipped with Yosemite 10.10 back in 2014 and I upgraded the OS every single year for 5 years up until Mojave 10.14 and I regret doing that because every year when I upgraded it especially later on with High Sierra and Mojave that it started slowing down because of the OS upgrades even after a fresh install of each one. Mojave was a good OS as well and honestly isn't too different to Catalina apart from dropping support for 32-bit apps and getting rid of iTunes and it was pretty stable and I didn't really have any bad experiences using it but it wasn't perfect and honestly wasn't too different to High Sierra that came before it. High Sierra was like a modern version of Snow Leopard 10.6 because it didn't have many new features at all compared to Sierra and it tried to focus on Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements and runs on some Macs all the way back to 2009 but I found that to be quite buggy and actually ended up downgrading back to Sierra after a couple of weeks and it's considered to be one of the worst versions of macOS so I would honestly try and avoid using it in 2020. Apple has definetley made better versions of OS X and macOS. If I could run any version of OS X right now and still be able to run all of my Apps and have things like AirDrop and iMessage it would have to be Snow Leopard even though it's 10 years old now because it's such a solid OS and I still have an old Late 2006 iMac 20 running Snow Leopard and I still really enjoy using it because I've never had any software problems or bugs at all and it's still a really fast and usable computer and it's the best User Experience I've had with any version of OS X on an Intel Machine.,0.097,0.812,0.091,-0.7532,-1

gpcxey,mac,Yh I was just about to say that. The 16” would be a great investment for people who want to use their computers for intense software work. The 13” gets so hot sometimes I feel I can fry and egg on their. In a perfect world Apple would still be making the MacBook Pro from 2015 with the new Touch Bar which is very un useful and more of a gimmick with mag safe and ports. It’s so frustrating worrying if your mac is going to be in one piece when you get back home. Another thing I wish they would fix would be adding more ports. I’m getting a little frustrated carrying my adapter with me everywhere and then treating it as if it’s a diamond just because Apple can’t reduce prices.,0.066,0.784,0.15,0.8765,1

gq7bxl,mac,What do you want to use the computer for?,0.0,0.86,0.14,0.0772,1
gq7bxl,mac,I would go for the Mac. Using virtualization software like Parallels or VMware you can run any OS inside it if you have enoug RAM of course it’s specially useful if you are a developer and want to test your program in multiple OSs Macs support them all. Plus you’ll still get the responsiveness and generally comfortable feel of macOS and all of its perks when combined with the Apple ecosystem. It is true you can build a cheaper PC and while Windows has gotten more stable over time at least to me Windows is still painful to use. Probably because I’ve used Mac all my life and friends who have only ever used Windows think I’m crazy. You can also in theory build a hackintosh and it’s actually a very cool idea but it will not be supported by Apple so if something breaks it’s going to be hard to fix it. However I must also say that your budget is important if you have the money to get the iMac for for it. But if you don’t the PC will do fine.,0.04,0.851,0.108,0.8422,1
gq7bxl,mac,What do you do in the virtual environments?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gq7bxl,mac,I am faster on the Mac with multiple screen plus terminal plus docker. I used Mac Windows Linux plus other OSes MacOS vs Windows - On a foundational level MacOS is more stable from UI quirks point of view. Unix foundation is solid uptime is rock solid similar to SunOS. - Windows still have issue with multiple screen scaling. A lot depends on hardware you pick - Windows is moving toward the MacOS route with Linux subsystem winget package manager kinda like apt-get and recently Windows terminal lol - looks like a wrapper of PowerShell DOS prompt and Linux terminal - PowerShell has a good feature of passing objects instead of string - MacOS can be locked pretty tight with the available encryption you can argue Windows too but Windows is a patchwork of security app which is hard to be certain. Window custom build - not sure if this refers to Hackintosh. If so Cost is pretty close to the real thing once you get all the nice parts. Then you’ll appreciate what goes in in designing a good system. Easy to make things go fast if speed is what you are after it’s harder to make them work well together. I was never completely satisfied with my build. If you are after a build with ECC memory for example your choices are pretty limited. - down side is software upgrade when apple upgrade the OS they sometime throws a curve ball to the Hackintosh community which they hit fine the community is great in that respect. From my experience it’s a matter of your times do you want to fidgit with it or are you on the “done that moving on” mode. Ultimately MacOS save time for me and doesn’t have UI peeves. Windows is getting there multi touch still lags behind on smoothness UI still lag behind etc. personally Windows is at least 5 years behind. Microsoft commitment to a tighter release schedules is good. New features are heading in a better direction. Although they have more options to customize i feel you get more control on Mac. —- good GUI Unix under — done,0.045,0.758,0.197,0.9954,1
gq7bxl,mac,Why iMac Pro ? It's designed for heavy loading tasks in graphic/video processing not for casual desktop users. It's a beast for that specific region but can not compare to even a 1500 custom build PC if you're talking about gaming. iMac Pro and Mac Pro are 18 wheelers. You won't drive an 18 wheeler for a speed race but who would win if everyone is towing 40 tons of cargo ? And if you have no need for 40 tons of cargo why do you compare the price of 18 wheelers to a Ford Focus ? If you want to compare make it on the same level. If you just need a regular desktop computer both regular iMac not Pro and Mac mini would be more suitable. And if you're talking about gaming or server-end applications get a PC.,0.03,0.918,0.052,0.6242,1
gq7bxl,mac,I JUST made this similar switch a few days ago. And let me put the TL DR upfront TL DR OS X is a drastically less mature and capable desktop experience vs Windows 10. Ok so with that bombshell out of the way. I sold both my gaming laptop and desktop and grabbed a new Macbook Pro 16 Larger screen and better gaming on 5500m Debating returning it for a base 2020 MBP 13 as I do not really need the extra power cause I will game with Shadow and Stadia. Anyways overall learning mac stuff has been fun and interesting. The VMware fusion experience is DRASTICALLY cleaner than anything I have used on Windows. BUT not as capable in some areas. Like you can't present 16 threads to the VM as 16 cores. WHY? . Now to be clear I got this mainly for the MUCH better laptop experience Apple hardware and features offer. The track pad and Battery handling is SO much better than any Windows PC. Like playing games on the trackpad is not just possible I did it for an hour and it was a pretty 'not shit' experience in Destiny2! Stadia . Here are the things OS X totally FAIL at vs the Win10. - Multi Display handling - Connecting and disconnecting displays. - Updates and patches. - Arranging windows. - Swapping out windows. - Swapping between 2 windows. - Waking from sleep. - Re-installing the OS. - Re-paring a bad patch. - Apps crash and it is a PAIN to deal with vs a Win10 crash. - over zealous security preventing you from doing lots of little things. Remember the early days of Vista UAC... that but even worse. We are talking 20 minutes of OS adjustments and BIOS changes to do something as simple as apply an image to an SD card for a raspberry pi. and then you get to undo all of those things to re-secure it. And those are just my issues in 4 days. - So lets start with multi screen. You cannot turn off extra displays unless you power them down or unplug them. - Connecting a display can take a long time to recognize if ever. - Updates are like the Windows XP days. Forever to download and 40 minutes to apply. - Arranging windows is a horrid experience Microsoft patented the tech and the solution in OS X is horrendous if you are used to it in 10. - Working between multiple windows is a joke as you need to click to interact with the window vs Windows 10 which is aware of what window you want to work on most of the time by simply mousing over it. Something as simple as pausing a youtube video in another window requires 2-3 clicks. small but HYPER unnecessary! I can take a 10 year old garbage PC and have windows 10 up and running on it in about 20-30 minutes. a High end PC can be up and running from a blank disk in 10-15 minutes A clean install on a top end mac takes 1-2 hours! - Waking from sleep is a crap shoot. It forgets what is plugged in changes main display loses displays loses the mouse. It is a NIGHTMARE! I just told it to NEVER sleep except in laptop only mode. - It has failed to install updates TWICE! and took an hour to repair both times. resulting in some apps failing to launch and thus how I discovered how bad the clean install process is. Aaaaaaaand. None of these are stopping me from wanting to keep going. Using windows in a VM in unity mode gives me a DRASTICALLY improved desktop experience. And bootcamping into windows for other usability issues. is fine. If you do go mac. Save your receipt / get it from a place with a friendly return policy. Cause OS X is no where near as smooth as Windows 10 in MANY areas. Sadly. when it comes to the basic desktop experience. Windows 10 just works. EDIT Yes so far the Laptop experience has been totally worth all of these issues and learning experiences. IF I was desktop only though.... I would not go mac.,0.083,0.81,0.106,0.6887,1

gq9ceg,mac,usability of machines will ALWAYS be based on YOUR usage. if your workload does not require newer machines with more cores or large amounts of RAM faster ram than you can get away with older models with lower specs for a longer period of time . that would be anything related to the average person specs internet word/presentation creation watching videos online light h.264 video editing or photo editing. that can be done on Macs that are 10 years old with little slow down. friends and clients I know who buy MacBook airs are literally buying it for portability not for speed power throughput or longevity. they buy it with AppleCare and WITHIN that 3 years of warranty they're going to be selling that MBA and getting the latest one. so they always have a device that can be dropped off to Apple under warranty for repair if needed MBA cooling is something of a joke I believe the fan on the latest one isn't even attached to a heat pipe for the cpu. so if thermals ARE a concern long rendering at max load or longevity in having the Mac for 5-7 years id lean towards the 13 with the 10th Gen cpus x200B to get you a MORE specific answer we'll need to know your workload usage types and if portability is a priority over properly powered device. or if its just budget constraints,0.009,0.95,0.041,0.738,1

gq8qe1,mac,In the US those batteries were 129. As far as DIY this was one of the last batteries that end users could safely remove. Newer Macs feature flexible often glued down batteries that can be a safety risk if not possibly removed. This 2012 battery pops in and out with a few screws check the videos. I’m a former genius trust me it’s stupid easy. Now in terms of Apple versus 3rd party most Apple batteries are going to be a few years old sitting in warehouses and storage at this point diminishing their battery life.

Any external hard drive will work it doesn’t need to be one of the “for Mac” labeled ones. Obviously spinning disks will be slower but much cheaper.

gq386z,mac,My take on a potential ARM MacBook is as follows we don't know anything about it yet it could totally not happen look at the Airpower debacle or happen in 5 years for all we know so if you have an old MacBook and want to change it just do it.

gpptda,mac,I got a used wireless apple keyboard for 5 online and ended up taking the automotive approach on that battery door.

Put a quarter in the slot and used pliers to get some leverage. None of that worked so I just took a big drill bit and attempted to drill out the battery door with the idea I’d order another then I hammered a bolt extractor into the hole and attempted to pry it open. Did nothing except bend the keyboard and wear out the end of my bolt extractor. That thing was stuck and nothing on earth was ever going to make it come out.

gpptda,mac,Use vinegar to slowly soak in you need to give it time to loosen hours even . Soak a cloth with the vinegar and leave it on the case with the case turned up so the vinegar soaks downwards into the screw thread. Find a tool/coin/key that is a really snug fit to slot and you can grip really well. Then instead of trying to open it fully just try and get it to move a little wiggle it back and forth with short motions and just work at it. Hope you get it open.

gq401u,mac,which 2017 i5? as your issue COULD be resolved with some minor fixing either hardware or software or even how its used . regardless your workflow does NOT necessitate the 16 besides the screen real estate. the 13 10th GEN ONLY has MUCH faster RAM 3733 vs the 2666 in the 16 . THAT would benefit your workload over the 16 provided you DONT require a dedicated GPU for your tasks and it sounds like you don't it doesn't sound like you need a new computer based on the tasks you stated a lot of the slow and Stutters can be resolved with restarting the Mac more often as YOUR bottle neck is ONLY the 8GB of ram you're using up 8GB the OS compresses RAM usage down. over time even though the Mac will free up used RAM it doesn't FULLY refresh until power flow is cut via restart or shutdown... NOT SLEEP if the routine has been put to sleep more often then restart or shutdown OS or USER preferences can become corrupted causing issues with normal everyday tasks. More ram on a new Mac WILL allow you to go longer before requiring a restart but it DOES still need a restart now and then. for optimal performance 8 GB Macs maybe 2-3 days 16GB a week or so. on my 32GB Mac I do it weekly no Matter what and by the end of the week at IDLE and no apps openly running my Mac shows 16-18 GB of ram in USE.,0.04,0.896,0.063,0.4234,1
gq401u,mac,I have had both.... Well i first got the 16inch i7 32 1T when it came out. Then I felt it is way too big after a few days of use and returned it. I just got my 2020 13inch 10th Gen i7 32 1T. All I can say is that this is also a very fast computer. I think in most cases if you don’t need heavy work on GPU you see no intolerable difference in speed. But it’s so compact that I’ll take it anywhere with me can’t say the same thing for the 16inch. Background I have another Desktop PC with GTX 1080Ti and 25 inch monitor. There is no computing power I can get from a 16 inch macbook pro that I can’t get from it.

gq401u,mac,I'm of the opinion that the i7 performance is really similar to i5 in 13 inch model so not worth spending more money for that the reverse is true about ram!

The reason for such move is enhanced security and the reliability of the operating system - the driver is removed from the kernel where it can crash and instead only the application which needs that must use it. I am in the same situation - with only one exception however - I can use sdcards.,0.028,0.926,0.045,0.1531,1

gpyw9o,mac,How full is your hard drive? It’s always good to always leave 10-15% free space. It’s possible that snapshots are taking up some of this space. Usually this can be cleared out by backing up the drive. I agree that 8 GB isn’t ideal and the limitations will be more apparent as you install newer and newer versions of macOS. Fortunately you can upgrade the RAM in 2018 and newer Mac Minis. I suggest buying 2 sticks of 8 GB DDR4 2666 MHz as soon as possible. Unfortunately this isn’t as easy to do as it should be. Obviously this is done on purpose but it is possible However wiping the drive and starting from scratch wouldn’t be a bad idea either.

gpx092,mac,Your Macbook will likely be fine for school usage. The ram and cpu are more than enough for programming and studying.

gpx092,mac,128GB SSD is a bit small. And a 13 screen might strain your eyes unless you have an external monitor too.

gpx092,mac,You should be fine. I will say that the 13 inch may take a strain on your eyes and does make having multiple applications on the screen more difficult since you will be having multiple programs at once. I currently have the 2017 Mac book Air with the 13 inch screen and using it for my first year at university definitely brought on some challenges. I will be upgrading to a Macbook Pro 16 inch within the next week or so since I need the bigger screen for and more ram. I wouldn't worry about it to much but if your focus is on programing it might be something to consider to upgrade to a bigger screen. You could always enlarge your text so you can see your code easier but it will show less code on the screen. What I would recommend right now is just to do some test runs with coding programs and see how it works for you. I wouldn't worry about storage since external hard drives are cheap. I recommend the Samsung t5 ssd since its light weight and has supper fast transfer speeds.,0.024,0.872,0.104,0.9365,1

gpwfvm,mac,Tuesday 4 April 2017 Some stats and facts Apple shared with us during the discussion Overall the split between notebooks and desktops in Mac sales is roughly 80/20. Personally I’m a little surprised desktops account for even 20 percent of sales. I would have guessed 85/15 and wouldn’t have been surprised to hear 90/10. ---- Around 2012 the numbers where 33 vs 67 % so 1 2. The following numbers come from Apples quarterly reports where they used to separate sales of Mac Desktops Mac Portable iPods iPhones and iPads. As of 2013 they simply lumped desktops and portables into a single mac category.

The GPU shouldn't matter that much for audio production since it relies on the CPU. MacBooks are only really good for portability. I should say that I have both a MacBook Pro and iMac. The MBP is mostly for daily tasks and on-the-go while I leave my iMac for the heavy lifting. You can get the base-model 2020 13 MBP with your budget but the RAM is too low and the processor could be better. It really depends how far you push your system.

gpwm1v,mac,Hi! Start by checking her iCloud Drive. Often files are backed up there form desktop documents and other folders on your Mac. A similar issue I came across here was solved by the files being backed up and being recovered from there. One thing you can do If you boot the Mac into recovery mode is open disk utility instead of reinstall macOS. Here you have the option to select your hard drive and run first aid. This can remedy software based hard drive issues and might diagnose some hardware ones. If you can’t find your files first air doesn’t help and your data is sensitive take it to a professional data recovery business. Unfortunately I can’t recommend one / If indeed your HDD Is the source of the issue replacing it with an SSD and adding some Ram to the Mac will give it a lot more usability. Did it to my 2011 Mac a few years ago still works great. You can do this at home with the right tools and patience but if you’re not handy with electronics Apple or a local repair shop can probably also help. It’s certainly not difficult and perfectly doable so don’t be intimidated if DIY is your only option. The SSD you linked is from a brand I’m not familiar with.

gq1jl9,mac,main reason you're seeing lower base clocks is Apple is trying to use more power efficient CPU's from intel. they're able to get the same basic performance when you need it by turbo boosting while having a lower base for optimal battery performance. The other thing that makes a bit more difference is RAM speeds those saw a good bump to bring them closer to what they should be. 2133MHZ is nothing for DDR4 RAM specs the new ones are 3733MHZ THATS the big difference between old and new Macs. Ram throughput being 1.5Ghz faster is a much needed upgrade to the lineup the downside to lower base clocks for laptops if the unit is hitting thermal limits it will be CLOSER to the Base clock number than the boost sometimes only boosting a couple hundred MHZ. in extreme scenarios ,0.057,0.827,0.115,0.8261,1

gppduq,mac,Depends on your budget. My personal recommendation is to start from the highest tier and just swap the Fusion Drive for whatever size SSD you want. This model comes with the highest clocked i5 that iMacs offer you can upgrade to the i9 if your budget permits and 8 GB of the Radeon 580X. The other tiers are fine but if you upgrade any of them they can get very close to this highest tier. In order of importance Upgrade to an SSD Fusion Drive are very outdated Get the best CPU you can reasonably afford Upgrade RAM yourself keep the base 8 GB at checkout If you really want you can go for the Vega 48 but an eGPU can do the job if you need more power down the line P.S. There are rumors that Apple is updating the iMacs this year. However the 2019 iMacs are really good value for what you get and are really reliable machines. I have one and it's fantastic!

gpoyfx,mac,No. It’s not upgradable.,0.423,0.577,0.0,-0.296,-1
gpkr75,mac,Well I think you should get the Intel Core i5 because the i7 and i5 won’t have too many differences the performance is mostly the same. On the other hand I’d buy the 16 gigs of ram instead of the i7. It’s way more future proof and it’s good to have more performance. In my knowledge the SSD size doesn’t affect the performance at all.,0.0,0.882,0.118,0.802,1
gpkr75,mac,No a 256GB SSD won't give different performance than a 512GB SSD unless one SSD is faster than the other. The amount of secondary SSD storage only affects how much you can store on your internal SSD not the performance. I do agree on going with the i5 since you're not going to see a difference in performance with an i7 unless you are doing compute bound tasks like video editing. You will get more heat and higher power usage with an i7 though which isn't as good for battery or component life...more heat is not a good thing for electronics. Also causes your fans to run more and make more noise which isn't great either. For me my Mac has a 250GB internal SSD that's really fast. And I have an external 512GB Samsung X5 SSD NVMe that's also very fast. So lots of fast storage. Great system. And get the 16GB of RAM memory if you can afford it that's really useful these days. I find that when I'm just running a browser the memory runs at about 10 GB in use. Of course I like to have lots of browser tabs open all the time rather than opening and closing browser tabs all the time.,0.048,0.883,0.069,0.6691,1
gpkr75,mac,In short yes in the long term there is a penalty. Buy 256 if you are really sure you will never be close to its limit capacity. SSDs have a specific amount of times that each block can be written before becoming an unusable block. SSDs internal controllers try to balance this by writing into the blocks that have less amount of writes count they do this to try to maintain an uniform wear of all blocks. Bigger SSD drives have higher expectancy lifetime because they have more blocks to distribute data into and wear less individual blocks. Also as an SSD goes full it speed goes down because of an extra effort needed by the controller to do its job when writing. Personally my 256GB “died” during an MacOS update I suspect because was almost full most of the time and blocks wear too much. 512 is doing better for my professional needs.,0.122,0.829,0.049,-0.8522,-1

gp5b1z,mac,I answered a very similar question about this on Ask Different recently. You oversubscribed the power on the USB bus. Those bus powered “hubs” use the cheapest components read that as most inefficient and they’re being asked to be a converter from DisplayPort to HDMI an ethernet port and whatever else USB device that gets plugged into it. My recommendation since that many peripheral devices were needed was to go with the CalDigit TS3 Thunderbolt dock. Yes. You’re referring to it as a USB-C dock which is incorrect. USB-C is just the physical port type not the actual connection. This is a Thunderbolt dock connected to the Thunderbolt/USB-C port. Being that it’s thunderbolt you’re now connecting over the PCIe bus and using a totally separate source of power. Those little hubs are great for quickly attaching a device here and there. They’re not meant to act as a replacement for a bona fide dock that turns your laptop into a desktop.,0.0,0.958,0.042,0.7605,1

Filco keyboard Arturia keystep logitech g pro and an arduino - the entire lot stop working the minute this issue occurs and there are no obvious errors in the console. Sounds like you are bang on the money with the USB 2.0/3.0 hypothesis - all my non functioning devices sit under the USB 2.0 controller section and devices that do not fall under it do not suffer issues. Indeed I've two satechi hubs but i've also got the CalDigit on its way. Glad it appears to resolve the issue very relieved.,0.059,0.825,0.116,0.8777,1

gpda4e,mac,I'm an Apple authorised service technician and I've just probably seen too many hard disks going bad. And I also knew that the HD failing will take down the Fusion Drive completely no chance of data recovery. So when I got my iMac in 2014 it had FD but I immediately reformatted it with separate disks. I installed the system apps and my profile on the Flash Storage and stored big data such as iTunes photo libraries videos and DVD rips on the large HD. I saved up and a year later I replaced the 1 TB HD with 2 TB SSD and upgraded memory to 32 GB . It still goes well and now I use the Flash as a temporary drive i.e. for Downloads folder. Now 2014 models had 128 GB flash. It is not the case any more - 1 TB FD has only 32 GB. I assume it would work OK for a while with the most often used system parts applications and user files such as caches fitted to the SSD partition. But you will soon experience the slowdowns. I would just try to avoid that last century tech spinning generation vibrations noise and extra heat but if I had to choose between 2 TB Fusion for 200 or 256 GB SSD for 100 I would probably go for ... 512 GB SSD for 300 🙂 especially if it's going to be a shared Mac where eventually family pictures and videos will be.

Also note that it seems to be a HDD rather than SSD so the USB 3.0 speed is more than enough to use the HD at its full speed. Thunderbolt 3 cables are more expensive but also support higher speeds this is useful for things like eGPUs and some Thunderbolt based external SSDs.

gowmdx,mac,You're trying to boot to Internet Recovery. My first question would be why are you booting it this way or does the Mac automatically boot to this? If you're trying to boot this way intentionally and if you have a newer Mac with the T2 security chip and if an Apple ID is signed in to the iCloud prefs with Find My turned on internet Recovery can be blocked. Or the network you're using isn't acceptable for this type of boot like a captive wifi network or one that uses open or WEP security. If you're not trying to boot this way intentionally then there's a problem preventing the Mac from booting even the local Recovery from the internal drive.

gov8sb,mac,Yeah I agree with F P G A. Pick any 27 iMac tier the cheapest isn't that bad of a start and just upgrade the storage to an SSD please avoid the Fusion Drive if you can . I would recommend more than 512 GB if you can but you can always use external SSDs for libraries and files. Definitely look into upgrading the RAM yourself so just stick with the 8 GB at checkout. I have heard good things about OWC but I use Crucial RAM and it's fine as well. Just check to make sure the specs match for your model There's also plenty of resources online as to how to do the upgrade if you need some guidance. The CPU and GPU on all the 27 iMac tiers should meet your needs but if you wanna future-proof you can always upgrade the CPU.

golok0,mac,Ice lake 10th gen 10nm has lower base and boost clocks than whiskey lake 8th gen 14nm because intel has a semi-broken 10nm process which they've been unable to scale to high clock speeds. However because 10nm needs less power to get the same work done it can boost for longer within the same thermal envelope so in practice it does actually perform better unless you're keeping the CPU's pegged with a sustained workload and cause it to clock down to base clocks which is hard to do with any real world workload . And because it is 10nm it has more room for additional transistors which intel has used to beef up the on-chip graphics. That's why the gpu is a lot faster on ice lake than whiskey lake.

goqg1a,mac,Oh damn - that's a tricky one because it depends on what Boot Camp did and then on specifically what your mate did. If he deleted the MacOS partition doesn't necessarily mean he deleted the recovery partition if OS X creates them for this model? so it might worth holding the Apple key and R as you start up and praying. Other than that you'll need to flash a bootable image of the OS X Installer from Windows to a USB stick. I have never had to do that but surely someone on this forum has! Finally depending on what your mate did exactly you mightl want to reformat the whole disk again reinstall OS X and then carefully try the whole Bootcamp shabang again from the top. This is because on these earlier models my understanding is that Boot-Camp creates a very funky work-around hybrid partition table to that both OS X and Windows can understand it. If anything other than X's partitioning tools have been used to modify that drive it will have messed with it.,0.046,0.859,0.095,0.7772,1

goh9s3,mac,Your question needs a bit more elaboration in my honest opinion. How long do you plan to use it years ? What is it that you study? More directly under what workloads are you going to put the computer? What lineup are you considering? Airs or Pros? With that out of the way I want to give my two cents to this hopefully going-to-be-thriving discussion based on what information you have already given . If you ask me you can do three things i save up more money and buy a more recent MacBook I would strictly go for pros . ii You can buy a decent MBP 13 2015 for €500 which is a decent option in the MacBook lineup. iii I do not know whether or not you considered Windows PC laptops but you may could give those a go. Now hear me out about the third option before you smash a downvote. I am fully aware that you specifically came to the Mac subbreddit with this question from which I can infer that you only considered MacBooks. The only reason why I am brining up PC laptops is simply to make sure that you truly evaluated every option you have at you disposal and came to the conclusion that a MacBook is your best bet. MBs are good if not very good laptops in my opinion but depending on you location and budget they might be a less optimal/riskier choice. Repair cost/availability as a prime example . If you considered all of this than simply ignore the third option I brought up and let's continue with the former two. Personally if I was in a similar situation - in dire need of a laptop with a €500 budget and commited to buying a MacBook - I would go with a 2015 MBP 13 . Those machines will get a year or two of support before becoming vintage and can still hold up just fine to today's standards. Their screens also blew that of the pre2018 MBAs' straight out of the water. The reason why I wouldn't necessarily choose to wait save up more is simply that on the MBA lineup which I don't recommend the first real choice is the current 2020 model - 2018 and 2019 models have butterfly keyboards and apart form the better screen don't really offer anything more than the 2017 or older models - but they do cost more. The Pro lineup is similar - 2016-2017 models have flexgate problem and the 1st gen butterfly keyboards. The 2018 and 2019 models are more solid in that regard but still rock the same KBs. All in all if you were to choose to save up the first modell I could recommend was a 2018 MBP but not with a warm heart - but they go around double your budget. Two words about the butterfly keyboard they are not 100% to fail. But the presence of this type of keyboard is still a risk factor that I would avoid if I was the spend the money the go around for. To sum it all up I would probably buy a 2015 MacBook Pro 13 based on the info you gave. x200B EDIT added and commited to buying a MacBook ,0.043,0.857,0.1,0.9859,1

gokysd,mac,I believe the MBA is dual core and the MBP is quad core and higher. If both are in budget then go with a MBP. A MBA is for more lite work loads. It’s your everyday/student users besides graphic design/photography/abode users. MBP is more for heavy power users and being used for work instead of play. If you can do both then go with a MBP but I would say a lot of people purchase a MBP when really they just need the power of a MBA.

gof3xo,mac,Apple has some good information here I have always used Macs but I have used Windows and Linux. I think a key benefit is that Macs tend to be reliable and well designed.

goghmv,mac,It depends on a lot of things. If you live where you have access to an Apple Store I would say go for it.

Also I am not aware of any flexgate stagelight issues occurring on the 2013 models iirc unless you mean 2016? I wouldn't go for the 2014 or 2015 models though considering they're 5 years old already and would be pretty dated on arrival.

So when you do not have any software arguments then there is only iCloud and syncronization left. And that requires that you have more than one Apple device.

go60vm,mac,You can use more than one pointing device. In my desktop setup I use a Magic Trackpad on the left and a mouse Razer DeathAdder Elite on the right. I initially got the trackpad to reduce the amount of left button clicking done by my right hand index finger. You could do something similar with an extra mouse/trackpad to reduce the strain on your dominant hand. Another possible option is to reduce the amount of mouse work and switch to using more keyboard shortcuts Cmd - and Cmd - - typically used to zoom in apps . Also check that your work environment is properly setup screen/keyboard/mouse/trackpad placement so that you're keeping a proper posture. I often switch between a sitting and standing desk either by using a desk that can be height adjusted at work or by putting my work from home laptop on a box to add extra standing height.

go4zjf,mac,deleted ,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
go4zjf,mac,Yes fusion drives are slower but the problems you are describing are coming from something else. Double check your temperatures and make sure it is not throttling. Check activity monitor during import / rendering to see what the bottleneck actually is. Typing this from a 2015 iMac with a fusion drive... and I have no issues video editing on the fusion drive although I typically use external SSD array . Edit Did you buy this direct from Apple? Have you done a fresh install of OS X?,0.071,0.838,0.091,0.1926,1
go4zjf,mac,The fusion drive 100% makes sense on why your computer is running slow. No matter the specs whether it’s a maxed out Mac. If you’re running everything off that slow outdated rpm drive your computer is gonna run like hot garbage. Return the Mac and upgrade to an SSD no matter how long it takes it’s worth the wait instead of stressing over hard drive issues. It’s stupid that Apple decides to put a slow ass hard drive mixed with decent specs to pair it with then screws the user if they don’t know shit about hard drives which then makes them think their computer is busted plus wasting lots of money because they didn’t understand what a fusion drive really is compared to the usual SSD’s that Mac’s come with nowadays. If you wanted to get a PC it’s super easy to max out a good build at a good price but if you like the Mac ecosystem for editing and other things go for it. I even prefer to use Photoshop and editing videos with FCPX on my MacBook Pro quadcore i5 8gb ram integrated graphics instead of my main PC i7 8700 gtx 1080 16gb ram which is much much stronger just because it feels fresh and everything is simple for all my needs.,0.081,0.818,0.101,0.7615,1
go4zjf,mac,It is running so slow. The multicolored wheel spins anytime I click on anything and apps like iMovie and GoPro Player have to be forced closed because they get hang up and the wheel spins forever. It definitely has nothing to do with Fusion Drive. Plug an external drive to it and set Time Machine backup keep the network connected and leave it on overnight. Sometimes a new system needs time to reindex spotlight rebuild launch database update all apps syncing all data with cloud server etc etc. If it's still working weirdly after 1 day check Activity Monitor. There should be some processes that eats up most of the CPUs. Depending which process is going rogue there are different ways to deal with it.,0.05,0.91,0.04,-0.0516,-1

go0v0k,mac,It could be a failing HDD. Based on other comments it seems you’ve tried recovery and all the resets. One thing I would try to isolate the issue is if you know how to install Linux or windows on an external drive using a another computer... if you have another Mac you can access then you can try installing Mac OS to an external drive too. Then try booting your Mac from the external drive. If it works you need a new HDD if it doesn’t then real good chance that you need a new logic board,0.052,0.898,0.05,-0.0516,-1

gnzeof,mac,If a picture is worth a thousand words a video is worth a million. Unfortunately none of those words are even remotely helpful. What are we looking at here? All we know is you have a Mac Pro G5 that doesn’t display anything on the screen which isn’t much more than the title of this post. We need to know are you certain the monitor is working? How? did you hear the boot chime? did you hear any beeps are you hearing the fans spin? when was it working last? what LEDs on the logic board do you see? most importantly were you doing anything to the Mac like cleaning the insides adding memory flashing a video card applying some patch to make it compatible with something it normally isn’t etc.? Relevant details are key to helping us help you.,0.016,0.85,0.134,0.9355,1
gnzeof,mac,Computer engineer student here. You are going to need to be a little more specific. It’s impossible to know why your computer isn’t turning on. Does the hard disk turn on? Do you hear it spinning? Does the power supply fans turn on? Look at what fans turn on. Is the Mac telling you any information—maybe through an led on the case or something? Did you look up issues on google that this specific model has? You should try to figure out where the issue is by seeing where in the chain of hardware the Mac fails.,0.052,0.948,0.0,-0.6322,-1

go4te2,mac,Are you asking the antique EDID no recognized problem ? Basically if you can set to native resolution in Display settings you won't have blur text. Problem is computer recognize external display model by EDID which is acquired when you plugged it in if the EDID of that monitor is not listed in macOS supported device data list it wouldn't recognize the device model and some special resolution won't be listed in the options. So it's not the problem of 24 inch monitors in general but each individual model. You should search using the model codename and check its macOS compatibility. If you don't even know the model or not willing to do that buy a 3rd party driver tool called SwitchResX And if it still no works unlikely you can still generate a custom display profile following this instruction ,0.068,0.884,0.048,-0.2263,-1

The new 16 MBP is pretty set for a few years ahead but If you have the time to wait and the money then id say get the updated one because it will probably have the updated processors and the other goodies that apple has been working on. I think there was rumors that Apple was working on their own processor and I am wondering with the release of the new iPad pros if they are planning on putting their own processors in the new MBPs.

go5m51,mac,1. Screenshots mechanism is changed. Now a screenshot will delay for 5 seconds before it's actually saved as a file so that you can interact with the capture data to annotate on it or transfer to other apps without saving as a file. And after it's actually saved as a file sometimes it will have another random delay before it shows un on the desktop. Read 2 for explanation why the delay. 2. It's normal that a newly created file will take several seconds before it shows on the desktop because each individual file icon on desktop is not just a plain data block but a dynamically changing window . Each single file will be monitored as a individual tracking handler in WindowServer system service. So it's actually not a good practice to have a lot of files on desktop because each file will takes up some system resources both memory and CPU. 3. Recent Finder window is the result of Spotlight search. It won't change until the spotlight index is updated. It's designed for you to search for files quickly not a tool for managing files. You should go the exact path that store these files instead. 4. As explained in 2 there will be an inevitable delay before the icon shows up on desktop. Sometimes the delay would be quite long.

gnyxd0,mac,Firstly which Macbook do you have year and specs? Catalina should run very well on a more recent Mac. Now here's the bad news. You cannot simply downgrade an OS. It requires a full erase of the drive. Apple's server has your Mac listed under Catalina now so in order to reinstall High Sierra it may take a lot of steps. I could provide you links but it's best to contact Apple Support so they remove Catalina off the server for you and put you back to the OS your Mac shipped with. They may charge you for the phone call if you don't have Applecare Plus. If you don't want to do that then you may go through these long steps from this link. Honestly I would recommend if you ever want try out a new OS it's best to create a partition on your drive and install it there so you can test it with your apps. It's a very bad idea to blindly upgrade to a new OS version over your current setup. BTW the Time Machine restore will only bring you back to a previous version of Catalina. For example if your original install was Catalina 10.15.3 and you upgraded to 10.15.4 then Time Machine can restore you back to 10.15.3 but it does not backup an entire OS only the files.,0.039,0.818,0.143,0.9811,1

gnxmcb,mac,Honestly it’s a preference thing. Apple care is basically limited warranty for three years plus two accidental coverages... Limited warranty portion will cover you for three years in case of any hardware failure and as long as there is no physical or liquid damage you do not pay anything get it fixed. Accidental coverage has two tiers screen damage and any other damage... meaning if you physically/liquid damage your screen you have to pay a deductible 129 in Canada to get a new screen. If ANY other physical/liquid damage no matter how small or big Apple care will limit the cost 320 in Canada . For example you spilled water on you Mac and now it needs new top case screen battery and motherboard ... without Apple care you are looking at easily over 1k in cost but with Apple care the maximum you pay is 320 again in Canada To sum up keep two things in mind 1 Are you careful with your device or clumsy? If clumsy Apple care is good value 2 Remember at the end of the day no matter who makes the product. It’s an electric product and there is always a chance of failure. If there is a hardware failure after the first year you are responsible for the cost you will have to look up the deductible cost for accidental damage where you are Hope this kinda clears it up a bit and helps you make a decision.,0.129,0.702,0.169,0.8442,1

The thing is most VSTs aren't actually capable of that and so you end up with 24 or 32 bit precision with a bunch of zeros tacked on the end.

gnm2db,mac,I'm pretty sure you don't understand how to use the 16 in terms of battery. It has a dedicated GPU and when it's activated by certain apps it will drain the battery because it's in high performance mode. I have the 16 and I get the full quoted 11 hours battery when used properly. There are only 2 major things that are causing the battery drain and possibly a 3rd one. I have a 16 MBP with the AMD 5500 8GB card. 1 issue is the AMD dGPU. It drains battery. Period. 2 issue are the apps being used that activate the dGPU. Here is my short list of apps that are doing this. Chrome. Until recently it activated the dGPU but has been fixed but it’s still a major resource hog and drains battery. Final Cut Pro X activates the dGPU. Apple's Photos app activates the dGPU. Adobe's Creative Suite . Resource hog and activates the dGPU. Pixelmator photo editor. Activates the dGPU. Connecting the MacBook to any external monitor activates the dGPU. iMovie activates the dGPU. Bootcamp. Running Bootcamp'd Windows works only on the dGPU and there's no way to switch it to the Integrated Graphics. Playing most games activates the dGPU. These apps cannot run smoothly using the Intel Integrated Graphics because MacBooks with dedicated graphics like the AMD 5000 series ship with lower grade Intel Integrated Graphics. 13 MacBooks come with better Intel Integrated Graphics to run these apps since they don't ship with a more powerful dGPU. Lastly the 3rd reason for battery drain but not as major as the dGPU is keeping the screen brightness above 70%. If you're using the auto brightness control then this may not affect the battery unless you're using it outside or in uncontrolled lighting. Without fail I get 11 hours of battery on my 16 MBP when I'm using apps that don't activated dGPU such as Safari and Apple Music. It's best for people to verify if the dGPU is activated. Apple Menu-About this Mac. If the Intel UHD Graphics 630 and the AMD Radeon 5000 Series GPU are listed then the app you are using will drain your battery. If you're unsure which ones then close all your apps and launch each one and verify if the dGPU is activated. Lastly if you leave these apps open and just shrink them into the dock or close their windows they are still keeping the dGPU activated so you will still experience battery drain even when you're using basic apps like Apple's office suite. There is nothing wrong with your 16 MBP's battery or the computer or the system management controller. These battery complaints have been going on for several years with MacBooks that have dGPU's. More apps today are using the dGPU so it's not always easy to achieve the advertised battery life. If you absolutely need to use these apps at a constant it's best to plug in the Mac for long sessions,0.04,0.853,0.107,0.99,1

gnjv0i,mac,From what I understand if you’re doing large video editing projects the extra 4GB in the 5500M 8GB will be utilized and help speed things up. And if you’re playing high res gaming in 4K then you’ll have much bigger textures to keep in memory in which the 8GB certainly help. But if you’re doing 1080p gaming especially on a Mac that’s normal to keep them FPS up then you’re not loading super high textures so the 4GB is all you need. I’d put it this way either get the 5300M because you’re not pushing the machine like a gaming PC would or get the 5500M with 8GB because you’re willing to spend to get every FPS you can . Why get the 5500M and only stay at 4GB? Do one or the other not the middle. This video may help ,0.021,0.879,0.1,0.8643,1

NO 13 has a dedicated GPU 16 models are running 9th gen CPUS and dedicated GPU ALL thunderbolt 3 Macs have the option of using an eGPU with some benefits and shortfalls a Dedicated graphics card will give you a good bump in FCPX and After effects performance pending workload and codecs used If this is a work related machine I'd get the best imac you can afford at least the 1499 best 21.5 . that gives you 6 cores a decent gpu you WILL want to do any RAM and SSD upgrades when you order as they're a PITA to upgrade after the fact 27 has USER upgradeable RAM which could help with buying a better iMac and then upgrade ram down the road still wont be able to swap the internal SSD easily x200B and you can use apps like Splashtop Desktop or screen share natively and control your iMac from your current AIR.

The old hard drive had gotten so slow it was nigh unusable. I thought opening it up and putting it back together would be the hard part. That turned out to be relatively easy. Instead the hard part was restoring my data from my Time Machine backup. First I tried to restore from Time Machine via Recovery Mode but that resulted in a system that froze during startup. Then I tried to recover directly from the old HDD via USB but that didn't work at all.

gnj440,mac,If you are only looking at the BASE model iMac Pro another machine to consider is a maxed out i9 iMac. You would be able to upgrade RAM on that machine and if you get a pure maxed out SSD not a fusion drive there would be a left over SATA port on that machine for future SSDs that you could put in since they are not crypto locked to the motherboard. A maxed out i9 iMac is performance competitive with the BASE model iMac Pro. I’ll link the thread that I started last year when I was trying to decide between a maxed out iMac vs a base model iMac Pro. I ultimately decided to go for the Vega48 GPU with a 2TB SSD. And it was 1000 cheaper than the base iMac Pro The base Mac Pro is not good value. Even a maxed out iMac i9 can out performance wise. The Vega 48 can outstrip the Radeon 580x base GPU of the Mac Pro. The intel Core i9 9900K has better per thread performance than a Xeon. The Mac Pro only starts making sense when you look toward the higher end models Now so late in the product cycle I would look in the Used market or refurbs for iMac Pro’s that are 10 core or better. If you were going for an 8 core machine the i9 iMac wins as far as value per dollar. But you may get good deals for 10 core or 14 core models. But I will say that I have been happy with the i9 iMac. It is slightly more noisier than the iMac Pro but it is still a pretty quiet machine and it still has the user accessible RAM hatch on the back. This makes it the only other Mac other than the Mac Pro that can be RAM upgraded. and the Core i9 iMac can be upgraded to 128Gb of RAM. And the 8 Core i9 can outperform an 8 Core Xeon in the Geekbench stats.,0.02,0.931,0.049,0.8707,1

If you plan on keeping a system for a long time I would go Mac Pro and upgrade to a nice display when you have the funds.

gndtzb,mac,Yeah it's a shame that Apple doesn't produce a machine for that demographic. Everyone thought that the Mac Pro would be more modular and affordable but you see where that went... Maybe the demographic is so small that they'd rather have people go for the Mac Mini rather than add a new product line. It would be cool if they did a Mac Mini Pro but that would only really need to focus on the CPU since most people I've seen pair a Mac Mini with an eGPU. One can hope...,0.023,0.926,0.051,0.3612,1
gndtzb,mac,Because the investment in that line wouldn't generate a suitable return. Even if this was profitable which given Apple's market positioning is not likely This would cannibalize the high end mac mini which is powerful enough for almost anything that doesn't require a high end GPU but this also has eGPU options if you really can't justify a mac pro . Honestly if you spent 3k on the best mac mini you could get and 600 on an eGPU what application would you need something above that but below a mac pro? What market is there for that? Then look at apples positioning Simplify computing. That extends to the aesthetic. The mac pro is the only device that bucks this trend and it's intention is as a halo device that will allow creative studios that like macOS to get enough horsepower to keep the demand for enterprise grade creative programs on macOS. What you want is Microsoft or Google's business model which is add features see what sticks and let the consumer figure out the details.

gnd3vz,mac,The only thing they could put in technology-wise that's newer are the 10th gen CPU's and maybe a graphics card spec bump. The 10th gen CPU's are not that much faster than the 8th and 9th gen that are in the current imacs only a few percent and they do this by running hotter. See e.g. the i5-9600K vs i5-10600K. The iMac is already known for not having good thermals so an even hotter CPU will not sit agreeably in that chassis. Probably not worth it in the grand scheme of things. Of course this may be the year of the big case redesign which is likely to come with better thermals better camera better audio. But it may also feature soldered storage and non-upgradable RAM so ... Edit I misread the chart. They are not much faster for single core but they are faster for multicore. So I guess it depends on your workload. They still run hotter though.,0.039,0.913,0.048,0.3695,1

The latest products has improved multi-antennas interface and the performance with multiple connections but generic residential usage doesn’t make much difference.

gnfn16,mac,Can't do a 120Wh battery because then it'd be illegal to carry on planes in the US. If Apple wanted/cared about user-upgradable RAM or storage the 16 would already have it. Same with an SD slot. Vega 56 heat and power draw is impossible to fit into a decent laptop form factor. Vega is a monster power-wise.

gnfn16,mac,The 17-inch MacBook Pro was an absolute beast but now that Apple's released the 16 MacBook Pro the 17 is never coming back unfortunately. You've listed some incredible specs here with a 17 4K mini-LED screen with a 12-Core Xeon up to 128GB of Ram 8TB of Storage and Vega 56 graphics! People would buy this if they wanted the most powerful Pro Notebook from Apple if they're travelling all the time and need that desktop power. Apple are gonna continue updating the 16 MacBook Pro and the 15 MacBook Pro lasted for 13 years from 2006 to 2019. I could see Apple putting some of this stuff into the 16 MacBook Pro like 12-Core Processors but in a few years I think they'll want to switch to their own ARM CPUs and even use their own GPUs instead of going with AMD and using the Vega 56 which is the same GPU that's in the iMac Pro. I just don't think Apple would have both a 16 and a 17 with the 17 obviously being much better overall starting at 3 000 with 32GB of Ram and Vega graphics. It would stop people buying the high end 8-Core i9 version of the 16 for 2 800. Having a really powerful Xeon with Vega graphics and a 120Wh battery what would the battery life be like when using Pro Apps like Final Cut Pro Logic or Photoshop and how efficient would it be? I'm guessing you'd need a really powerful cooling system with 2 or 3 large fans with massive vents like the 2019 Mac Pro!,0.019,0.847,0.134,0.9862,1
gnfn16,mac,I never understand why so many people jump right on Apple's ass when a new Windows machine comes out. How about comparing the new Dell to the Lenovo X1 Extreme or the HP Workstation? Why does Apple always have to be the one Worried ? I don't give a rat's fuck what Dell puts out. I don't want Windows and I don't want a Dell. Apple's Macintosh computers are unique where they tie into Apple's ecosystem with the iPhone iPad Apple TV and the Apple Watch and nothing compares to Apple's UNIX-based MacOS. Dell's machine won't do shit for me with that. Sorry Dell. No sale! And just because Dell put out a 17 doesn't mean Apple should just because they had one before. How about Lenovo making a 17 ?

gn9fij,mac,Yes you’re right. All the battery related values you’ve ever seen are only estimations. There isn’t really a gage on the battery telling you the percentage number of remaining charges. Device keeps tracking the battery usage including voltage changes temperature current usage and lifetime since it’s first powered and calculate the approximate value of remaining charges and max capacity based on a chart which is derived from spec and statistics. That’s why you’ll see battery stuck at 100% for hours and drops like free fall after it hits 99%. That’s why fast charging will be slowed down when battery is 80% full.

gmzcuv,mac,Agree with everyone suggesting SnazzyLabs on Youtube. Some very helpful videos! Some things I wish I’d have known when I first switched 1. People will recommend a lot of add-on tools for improving gesture control window management etc. Ignore that for now! Most people will benefit from these but explore what Mac offers first. Play around with gestures hot corners and mission control and find some settings that feel good and work well for you. After a couple of weeks when you really know what your Mac can’t do out of the box there are a ton of good tools out there to fill in the gaps. 2. Command Space pulls up Spotlight and lets you search your Mac easily open apps etc. If you find yourself using it but also find it limited check out Alfred for a search bar you can customize and program functions to. 3. If you work with audio you might eventually find someone recommending SoundFlower as a way to solve a problem with recording / rerouting system audio. Do not do it unless you absolutely have to — it can be a mess to remove from your system and is notorious for causing more problems than it solves. 4. Install AppTrap it’s available by Homebrew — it’s a simple utility that ensures all relevant files are deleted when you remove an application. 5. Command Delete will let you delete files. Function Delete behaves like Delete on a PC reverse backspace . 6. The options for Keyboard in System Preferences are robust as hell. You can set text replacements customize shortcuts and even create new shortcuts for any app. This is often overlooked but one of my favorite native features in macOS. It is also where you can toggle autocorrect if you have any issues with it. 7. If you find yourself frustrated with the way the media keys work aka you expect it to pause your music so you can watch a YouTube video but instead it is play/pausing the YouTube video and not your music install Mac Media Key Forwarder. You can set it to prioritize iTunes or Spotify instead of controlling whatever media is active on screen. 8. At some point you will find yourself running out of storage and you may find that “System Storage” is taking up way more space than you feel it should. If this happens go straight to SnazzyLabs — he has a great video on this and honestly I don’t know a MacBook user who hasn’t run into this problem over the course of years of use.,0.072,0.799,0.128,0.9706,1

The RX 580 is a powerful Graphics Card and Apple still uses the Radeon Pro 580X in the baseMac Pro 2019 which is just ridiculous and they use the 580X in the high end 27 iMac so you'll be fine with the graphics. The good thing is that you can always upgrade it down the line to a Vega 64 or a Radeon VII in a few years if the machines still performing well. Personally I wouldn't buy a 5 1 Mac Pro if you're wanting to spend under 2 700 even though it's really powerful just because it's a 10-year-old Mac Pro that isn't supported anymore with the latest version of macOS. At that price I would buy a brand new 27 iMac straight from Apple or a 16 MacBook Pro. The only reason I would buy one is if it was under 1 000 and was fully loaded with 12-Cores and 128GB of Ram with a few Terabytes of storage. You could probably buy a 2010 Mac Pro now and keep using it for another 10 years if you really wanted to if you kept upgrading the graphics and storage on it but you'd be stuck on Mojave forever and with a 10-year-old computer there's only so much performance you can get out of it. I have a 20-year-old PowerMac G4 Cube which still works perfectly fine but I wouldn't be able to use it as my main computer because I'd be limited by a 500MHz G4 Processor and it's PowerPC so there's pretty much no more software support and it can only run up to Mac OS X Tiger natively which is 15 years old. It would be usable for basic stuff but it would be very slow. ,0.027,0.882,0.091,0.9717,1
gn1c5z,mac,I just built almost this exact same system only 64GB Ram less than a week ago and my cost was about 1160. Mac Pro 4 1 400 on craigslist 3.46 12-core XeonX5690 276 with taxes and shipping - Ebay 64GB Ram 130 with taxes and shipping - Ebay 1TB M.2 150 Amazon Lycom DT-120 M.2 PCIe card 25 8GB Sapphire Radeon RX 580 GPU 180 It is super fast!

gn7on9,mac,USB adapters can be daisy-chained. There is a limit to the number of devices you can connect. Where you might have a problem is power and data transfer rates. USB A ports only provide 5.25v. If you connect to many devices some may not work. You can get around this by using powered hubs. You can also connect additional USB C hubs. They will provide more power for devices and bandwidth for data. This would be your best option. If you google usb daisy chain you should get some good info,0.029,0.882,0.089,0.6908,1

gmozp3,mac,Generally yes There are various modes of sleep a Mac can go into. At this point your question only describes the fact your laptop screen goes to sleep but this is different from your computer actually going to sleep. Regardless of your settings and assuming your MacBook Pro has a continuous power source then a system event such as copying a large amount of data will continue to occur even if various parts of your Mac go to sleep.1 This is because if your Mac is in the middle of an action such as copying files it will not go entirely into sleep mode e.g. your display may go to sleep but your drives are still fully powered up for read/write purposes . In terms of the speed at which data is transferred this can be affected by a number of factors but in your scenario the transfer rate should not be impacted. Of course if you're copying a large amount of data it is recommended you have your MacBook Pro plugged into an AC power source.

gmul54,mac,I have a 2019 27 iMac and it's great! Here's what I would recommend in order of importance SSD - So many people try to save a few bucks with a Fusion Drive but it really hinders performance. SSD is the way to go even if you choose a low capacity you can always use external SSDs for archived projects and resources. CPU - The CPU is the core of the computer. The CPU you pick will be with you for the life of the computer unless you want to void your warranty and break into your iMac . I would recommend getting the best CPU you can reasonably afford. I personally got the i9 but even the i5s should be good for most purposes. GPU - Every 27 iMac comes with a discrete graphics card which already puts it above the 13 MacBook Pro you have since only the 16 get discrete GPUs afaik . The Vega 48 is overkill unless you do heavy 4K editing. Besides you can always add an eGPU down the line as prices drop in the future. RAM - You got this one down. Upgrading yourself saves a ton of money. Just be sure you get the right spec from a reputable brand like Crucial or OWC . x200B I got my iMac last year with the same mindset. I currently have a working 13 MacBook Pro which is fine for most purposes. However I wanted some extra overhead for audio production Logic Pro X video production Final Cut Pro X and graphic design Affinity suite .

The GPU on the old board was bad and I cracked the glass when taking it off big ouch but looking around the glass cracks aren't near the black bars.

gml2ih,mac,Hello guys so I have been following the group for a while now and you helped me out with quite some stuff! Now I would like to receive your personal opinion about my dilemma. First of all how I upgraded the iMac? Well as many of you recommended I upgraded the ram from 4 to 14 GB cleaned It up from all the dust it was filthy removed the cd drive honestly does anybody still uses them? as well as swapped HDD to SDD. This means that now I have a blank canvas. So my main question would be What OS should I Run on my Frankenstein? Currently I have El Capitan running on it should I keep it or upgrade to Catalina or High Sierra? If the answer is yes would it affect gaming performance like CS GO? If I decide to upgrade it can I go back to older versions whilst keeping all the setting and the files? My Franky thanks you all in advance!,0.01,0.864,0.126,0.9548,1
gmi76t,mac,You start with three 2TB drives. Put all your photos on Drive 1. Sync Drive 1 to Drive 2 so your photos are also on Drive 2. Sync Drive 1 to Drive 3 so all your photos are also on Drive 3. Put Drive 2 in the safe-deposit box in the bank. Continue adding photos to drive 1. Continue syncing Drive 1 to Drive 2. Every 2 weeks to 1 month swap Drive 2 and Drive 3 at the bank and keep syncing Drive 1 to whichever of the other two you have on hand. This way you always have an offsite backup and are never more than 2 weeks to a month behind should you lose BOTH of your on-site drives.

gmc5c8,mac,The value proposition depends on what your price range is. First definitely go for an SSD. It's up to you how big you want it. I prefer to use external SSDs for libraries and project files but just make sure you don't go for the Fusion Drive and please no spinning hard drive for that matter! . Now for video editing you really want a good CPU GPU and RAM. I should note that GPU usage depends on the program. I heard somewhere that Premiere may not even use the GPU so I would definitely prioritize the CPU. Final Cut is optimized either way so that shouldn't be an issue. For RAM if you choose the 27 you can upgrade the RAM yourself. So you can get 8 GB to start then upgrade with 32 GB. Here's a link to the RAM I chose. Basically I would advise a 27 with SSD storage and the base 8 GB which you can upgrade later . Then it's up to you how far you want to spec out the CPU and GPU but I should mention that you will have the CPU for the life of the machine while GPUs can be connected externally through the use of an eGPU I should also note that there are rumors that Apple will update the iMac relatively soon but who knows what that really means . However I can stand by the reliability and stability of the 2019 iMac so I think it's a solid option as long as the bezels don't bother you they don't really bother me .

gmbb97,mac,Try to analyze this question yourself how can your Mac knowing where your iPad is ? A computer system is not a creature. It doesn't not have sensing organ and can not know what is going on outside of the case unless you install sensors to it. So the question would be what kind of sensor do you need and how can you extract the information of relative location of your iPad ? Visual information could be the easiest way to solve this problem. And that means you'll need to set up a camera on the ceiling over your head that will monitor your device arrangement all the time. It would cost you roughly 200 USD and it will eat up a chunk of your WiFi bandwidth not to mention that all the privacy concerns somebody is crying aloud. It is impossible to track precise location based on WiFi or Bluetooth signals. The human technology can only tell you an approximate circular area that is about 10 to 20 feels in diameter. At least not without extra add-ons like an antenna array. If you want inch-level locating using AoA angle of arrival or ToF time of flight method you will need to set up at least 3 full sized antenna around your room and all antenna must connect to your computer using zero-impedance antenna cable and you need to input the precise relative position of the antenna to your computer. Magnetic sensor could be a potential solution but it has limitations. The distance between edge must be within 1 inch and external speakers may interfere it because speakers have magnetic inside.

gm5vln,mac,Hi Tough but exciting position to be in! Getting a new Mac is always fun. I am somewhat of a fanatic and have several Macs. Looking at your hobbies and usage I have to say I would probably go with a different machine and setup. As good as it is I wouldn't go with the 21 iMac for a couple reasons. First in the long run I don't think you will be happy with the smaller screen size. I have the 27 and like it but almost wish it were bigger sometimes. And for you being a photo enthusiast I think your going to want something larger in the long run. Second Apple is slated to come out with a completely redesigned iMac line soon. This design and architecture is running long in the tooth. So if anything if you have your heart set wait for the new ones and get one of those or take advantage of the older model price drop. However my recommendation would be to go with the new 16 MacBook Pro. The specs and reviews are off the wall. It is a great machine with amazing technology. It gives you the power you need for Adobe apps and you can easily hook it up to a reasonably priced larger external monitor and have 2 screens to work on which is incredibly helpful. In addition it gives you the flexibility to take it with you to jobs or events. It is always nice to have a nice Home Workstation setup but then also have the portability option. Look at the new 16 read / view some reviews and think about it. Good luck let me know if you need more help R.,0.012,0.765,0.223,0.9971,1
gm5vln,mac,Go for the SSD storage.

gm5vln,mac,I would go for the ssd will instantly show an improvement,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.4588,1
gm5vln,mac,SSD without the least hesitation . The performance boost from SSD is immediately and almost every single operation will benefit from it.,0.063,0.711,0.225,0.6246,1
gm5vln,mac,I recently bought and swiftly returned an iMac with SATA hard drive. The startup time was the same as my 2009 MBP. SSD will definitely be my priority in whatever I purchase in future.,0.04,0.822,0.139,0.5423,1
gm5vln,mac,Here is what I would do if I was you. Old iMacs go for dirt cheap on eBay. You can easily find a mid 2007 iMac for 100 dollar or even less or even newer if you get a good deal. Buy one of those and use it with an external hard drive or ssd that you can find for 100 ish. This machine is in no way adequate for a proffesional but is a great machine for small tasks albeit a bit slow. It runs el cap but for a sub 200 dollar price point completely solves your storage problem as well as gives you a fully functional iMac that can perform basic side tasks and stuff that a pro would need and doesn't require a expensive high performance machine. I would recommend upgrading the ram to 4 or 6 gb if you choose to follow my advice . Now buy the other new iMac of your choice with a upgraded processor or even base model. Because now you have 2 processors the convenience equivalent of a high powered one enough ram combined to be fully adequate without shelling out a bunch of money for pricey ram and 2 harddrives in the 2007 iMac and the external one you can use it with while they are slow they can be used for files you don't use often that are massive and don't need on you main machine because hard drives can store a lot more data for less money along with the convenience of a low powered secondary machine. Really its a win win win because you get everything you need in your price point and more while not having to shell out a lot. Plus you also have 3 machines now with your MacBook. I assume you understand because you use an old MacBook that they last for a while without being too inadequate. The same is the case for iMacs.,0.037,0.837,0.126,0.9867,1
gmcrjf,mac,So macOS will purposely grab “stuff” and toss it into RAM. It will cache in RAM all kinds of data so that you can quickly access it. It will also take some and allocate it for itself - this will show up as “used” even though it’s just technically being reserved for whatever needs it next. This way the millisecond it’s needed macOS already has it allocated and ready to go. That’s just how it’s designed. In the “Activity Monitor” app there’s a chart at the bottom labeled “Memory Pressure” - this is where you need to look. As long as that’s green you’re all good. There are highly technical articles on the subject if you’re curious to read.,0.0,0.936,0.064,0.7717,1

gmcrjf,mac,Check activity Monitor. Its under Applications Utilities,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gmcrjf,mac,I'm going to quote an answer I posted from a similar question. What you’re probably referring to is inactive memory which is memory in RAM that was once needed but not anymore. Say in the case you opened Microsoft Word did a few things and then closed the app. MacOS can predict the likelihood you may use this application again within a certain timeframe. This concept is known as ‘temporal locality’ and so the application can start quickly again because the data still exists in memory. As there is a competition for memory resources by other applications MacOS can allocate resources by removing some of the inactive memory to allow memory to be stored in active memory memory currently being used by applications . This is a fairly old article but it’s a good read based on the topic Keep in mind too that you shouldn't really pay attention to the memory usage provided by CleanMyMac. Instead look at Activity Monitor's Memory Pressure. This memory pressure shows how efficiently resources are being provided to your processing needs. Green is good. Amber is okay. Red is bed. The red should indicate that memory resources are scarce.,0.027,0.857,0.116,0.954,1
gmcrjf,mac,Look at your activity monitor. Sort it by Memory so it will show the most greedy at the top. Is there something or multiple things that are using the bulk of it? I have found that some tasks stay open running even though I think they're closed. You can end the task from the activity monitor. kernel task Is the one that kills me. It doesn't take that many apps if there's just one that's greedy.,0.108,0.87,0.022,-0.7837,-1
gmcrjf,mac,That's exactly how a modern operating system should do in memory management. Because unused RAM is wasted RAM . All modern operating systems have implement dynamic virtual memory that will use all the physical RAM AND hard drive at the same time as memory space for user application. The guidance of such design demands OS to do two things 1. Fill up the physical RAM as much as possible. 2. Avoid unnecessary changes to memory allocation. Since a modern application will frequently request and release memory from the system it's waste of time to rearrange overall memory allocation every time. OS will tend to keep the released memory still associated with the original application that requested it as a cache space so that when the application requests for memory again you bet it will it can be allocated in no time. OS will dynamically estimate the activity of each application and determine when these preserved memory will be released. In macOS this estimation is called Memory Pressure measured from various factors. Generally most people will find a system kernel processes called WindowServer takes a lot of CPU and memory process. That's because WindowServer is the bridge between application and graphics hardware. When an app wants to draw something on screen WindowServer is the one that takes the demands from app and tells the graphics card what where and how to draw it. So when you have multiple apps with many windows on screen or you have a lot of files on the desktop WindowServer will stay in busy state all the time.,0.052,0.92,0.028,-0.6808,-1

gldmxj,mac,For those who didn't see my original post on May 5th LINK I am spray painting a 13 Unibody MacBook Pro in Satin Black. The Journey so far Completely gutted the shell Then the prep work begins. I sanded down all the parts started with 120grit then moved on to 240 and finished with 400. I then filled in all the scratches and dents as best I could Then I sanded it down with 240 then 400grit and it is basically ready for the primer I decided the best way to paint them would be to hang them from the ceiling that way I could paint both sides of them at the same time. So I used my loft space to paint them I gave them 4 light coats of Etch Primer leaving 30mins between coats It was halfway through priming the top case that I suddenly had the idea to remove the DVD drive slot and Kensington lock as I was planning on using a 2nd hard drive in place of the DVD drive anyway and I would regret it if I didn't do it. So I took it down and filled in the slots While I was waiting to repaint the top case I waited 24 hours for the etch primer to harden on the other two parts then very lightly wet sanded it with 400grit sandpaper to give it a smooth finish. This is how I hung the pieces from the ceiling with Masking tape and string I also masked the areas where the logic board makes ground with the bottom case I then proceeded to paint the Satin Black with 4 light coats The paint looked really patchy because of the light coats and I was worried it was going to look crap but I held out hope that the Satin clear coat would fix that. While the Black was hardening I finished the priming of the top case and it looked so much nicer with the DVD slot delete 24 hours later the Black was ready to clear coat and the top case was ready to sand. Top case primer sanded down 3 light coats of Satin clear coat followed by a single heavier coat to finish it off The Satin clear coat made all the difference and really made the final finish so much better. The insides look crap but you're never going to look at them anyway The final results for the top and bottom panels There are a few imperfections and some dust that settled on the paint but I'm pretty happy with the final finish. It turned out much better than I was expecting if I'm honest! It goes to show that if you put in the prep the results speak for them selves. The top case is currently in the loft after having 4 coats of Satin Black. 12pm tomorrow I will be applying the Satin Clear coat. Then 24 hours after that the painting will be finished. I'm currently waiting for a White Macbook Keyboard in the mail which I will be taking the Key caps from and transferring them to the keyboard for this laptop. Which I think will look awesome!

glq9rr,mac,This is happening to both of the Macs we have. It was just the MacBook Pro but just started on the Mac mini after the last update. I haven’t found anything that fixes it.

glr2x3,mac,What is making your MacBook feel like it’s slowing down. Is it always feeling sluggish even when playing around in the OS? Or only during certain workflows like having Photoshop and Illustrator open at the same time? You likely have low RAM for Adobe programs. 16GB is the new standard for graphic design but it all depends on what you’re doing. Perhaps you can update the RAM to 16? I forget if those have upgradable RAM. Also your storage is likely a slow spinning harddive. Standard laptop storage is now super fast like 10-20 times faster. Putting an SSD and RAM into your laptop would make it feel like new again. But if you’re planning on a new MacBook Pro anyway make sure it has at least 16GB RAM. Personally I would upgrade to 32GB RAM since you will likely keep the laptop for yet another decade. I keep mine forever also Edit for graphic design I recommend the 1 799 13-inch MacBook Pro that comes 16GB RAM and 512GB storage with 4 thunderbolt ports. You can hook that up to an external display when at your desk. If you don’t want external display then get the base 16-inch MacBook Pro for the bigger screen.,0.027,0.845,0.128,0.9638,1

glo8b4,mac,I have plenty of issues with Mac OS as well and the prices Apple charges. Your first issue though is easy. The Preview app button has a markup function. Open a PDF inside it and click the markup icon hover over the icons near the search box on the right side of 5e top ribbon menu . I think it looks like a pencil tip within a circle. Once clicked a bunch of markup icons will show up look towards the left side. You’ll notice a handwritten letter A. This is for signing. I just grab a white piece of paper sign it and hold it up to the webcam to capture it. After that it’s really simple to do it. Seconds. You can move align resize your signature anywhere you want in the PDF. Then I just print it again as a PDF save the file and send it to whomever.

glgf3k,mac,Wait a minute... 6TB of data in Outlook ? Are you serious ? I'm not sure how can he handle this because Outlook is apparently not designed for such task. It's a GTD Get Things Done and groupware tool but not a knowledge base nor a good journaling tool not to mention data storage. If it's real then he must have some SERIOUS PROBLEMS in his workflow. Outlook is infamous for locking up all its data in the proprietary repository and there is no way to change the repository path which is located at /Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office . Moving these data between machines would be difficult because you're supposed to use Outlook built-in archive export/import feature for this task. I'm not even sure simply copying files within that folder can work. A far as I know some people had tried to move files somewhere else and make symbolic lines to the old position but Outlook just ignore it and recreate a new profile instead. So the best solution would be manually archive and export every time. For a long term solution first he must learn NOT to put all data in the same stash because it means that you'll need to go though 6TB of data for only 1MB changes inside that way. Try to get a profession knowledge base / journaling tool like DEVONThink and classify data into different categories. If you have trouble making categories at least you can do this Ongoing Project Reusable Resources Recently closed projects Archives So that you only keep the ongoing project on the local drive and this should drastically reduce the data size that need to be synced every time. TL DR the whole point is to minimize data that needs to be synced every time. If he can do this then the storage media isn't really important.,0.095,0.855,0.05,-0.8921,-1

Furthermore the biggest fails came from the 2016-2017 Macbook Pros and people discovered issues with them within the first month of ownership. Now with that said just buy the 2020 Macbook Pro. Why? Because it's only a 250 difference and if you buy the 2019 model after a few short months the 250 difference won't be that much and will have high regrets that you cheap'd out when you had a choice. If it was a 500 difference then sure save the money but 250 is nothing. The Magic Keyboard is not just a better keyboard it's MUCH better.,0.102,0.841,0.057,-0.7212,-1

gbfwid,Dell,I was super close to buying the XPS 15 7590 and then I heard that the 2020 iteration is going to be released any day now. I know the 7590 is a beast but from the moment I saw it I didn't like the bottom bezel and the aspect ratio of the otherwise beautiful OLED screen. When I saw the projected 16 10 FHD screen of the 2020 version floating around on the interwebs I slammed on the brakes! My only worry is the price. I'm in Canada and I was getting the 7590 OLED with 16G Ram i7 9th gen and 256G SSD from Dell for 2100. Do you think the 2020 version will be much more expensive? Money's an issue so I'm vacillating. Update So I bought the unit. The bottom bezel has really grown on me. I find it looks cool and after all I've read about the OLED screen the 16 10 doesn't appeal to me anymore. Heard something too about the battery in the 2020 iteration being inferior to the 7590. Also 1250 of the unit's being subsided so I'm a pretty happy camper! - ,0.05,0.843,0.107,0.9251,1
gbfwid,Dell,Hello All I am planning on purchasing a new computer both for University Masters Personal Work. Currently located in the US. Looking at 2 options. Purchasing Options 1. Dell XPS 15 2019 version with i5 NVDIA 2. Dell XPS 15 2020 version with i5 Intel UHD. Applications I Plan on Running Power BI Tableau Large MS Excel files PowerPoint Word Processing Web Surfing and Emails. Questions 1. Is the 2019 version XPS with i5 NVDIA prone to overheating and/or getting warm a lot. 2. How is the hinge design on the 2019 XPS. I type a lot pretty fast and don't want the display wobbling on me. My old Dell XPS 15 2016 version had a pretty sturdy hinge. 3. How is Intel UHD vs NVDIA. For what I am doing will their be any lag and if so will it be noticeable? 4. Does the 2020 base model have i5 NVDIA. Looked on dell.com but could not find that option. Will it be announced in the near future? 5. Does the 2020 base model have a sturdy hinge. I type a lot pretty fast and don't want the display wobbling on me. My old Dell XPS 15 2016 version had a pretty sturdy hinge. 6. How is the sound quality on the 2020 vs 2019? 7.

gbfwid,Dell,Hi! Swede here. I'm very much interested in the new 13 XPS 9300 mainly to use with browsing and to play around with Linux. I know I could buy a cheaper laptop for that but I really like the 9300 and I don't mind paying a few hundred extra for it. However the 4K with i7 and 16 gb RAM seems a bit much... A few questions though hoping you can help me out. 1. Do you think 8 gb of RAM will be more than enough for my needs? I won't do any heavier stuff but still I went to 16 gb looong ago. Kinda sucks that it's soldered on and the RAM is the only thing I would LIKE to upgrade but since it comes with i7 and a 4K screen we're talking a 500 difference. 2. How come the frost white is unavailable? Really like the look of it but there's zero options for that in Sweden. Same with Germany I think checked out of curiosity I still want a nordic keyboard only the UK has it. Will it be released here? Absolutely ZERO help from Dell on this one it's like talking to a wall. 3. 4K seems like an overkill for a 13 inch screen I will scale it anyway. But are there any differences in quality of the panels otherwise? I prefer glossy screens but it seems I have to go with a matte one if I choose the FHD non touch one? 4. Are there any differences in hardware for the normal and the Developer Edition? Or is it ONLY that they pre-installed Ubuntu on the DE? Appreciate your thoughts. Thanks! ,0.01,0.837,0.153,0.9913,1
gbfwid,Dell,Hey all I'm interested in purchasing a two in one specifically the xps 13 or 15 2 in 1.

gbfwid,Dell,Hoping somebody can explain purchasing pros and cons of the new Dell XPS 15/17 machines vs the new Dell Precision laptops that to me look nearly identical. My needs . I'm an applications developer and photographer. Most of my work is only moderately processor intensive -- I don't do video editing don't do CAD don't play any games -- but I'd like the machine to be peppy want as good a keyboard and display as I can get. Another important thing for me is reliability and good support -- areas in which I'm not sure that Dell is strong. Been working on top-spec'd Surface Book 2 for last couple of years and been happy with it. Questions . Have new 2020 XPS 15 on order but it won't be here for many weeks.

gbfwid,Dell,Hi guys I am going to buy myself a new laptop for my birthday and I am almost decided to get a Dell with a 1660ti price/performance wise that is the best option in my country plus I really like the design . The two options are G5 15 i7 with 144hz 1080p panel and G7 17 i5 with usual 1080p panel The price is practically the same so I do not consider that. I like nice screens so that is a major factor and I will not use the external monitor. I do not play competitively and I have never used a 144hz panel before. As I have researched G5 has better build quality but I have been using a 17 inch laptop for the last 4 years now. Weight and battery performance are unimportant.

gqqx7q,Dell,Thoughts on my current XPS 15 9500 Pros ★ No Coil Whine!!! I used to own a XPS 13 9360 and the coil whine is always the most annoying issue that I faced especially when I am in a quiet room. Finally the Dell engineers was able to solve the issue! ★ New mold. By adding the 16 10 screen ratio and do some modification on the vent and ports this machine is finally built for the consumers! ★ Low heat. I thought the 10875H would be generating a lot of heats but the machine stay mostly cooled when I ran Path of Exile. When I tested the R20 the fan was not running at peak. Dell was able to engineer it very nice and is just as expected! ★ Four sided InfinityEdge Display! 16 10 really made the huge different and I compared it to Zbook Studio G5 the G5 was just not enough for me. By the way Dell also put the Windows hello facial recognition into the ultra thin bezel on top which is amazing! ★ Long battery life. I think it might because I chose the Full HD and that is why it will last for more than 8 hours. Not sure how long would the 4K last. ★ 60W PD charging. It will show that I am connected to a slow charger but it still charges the laptop even when I was running the Cinebench R20. ★ Powerful Performance. I was surprised that the performance is similar to my Ryzen 7 1700x. Cinebench R20 shows that the single core performed better than the Ryzen 7 1700x. Cons. ☆ All type C ports. It’s good that it comes with DA20u about the half size of DA200 without ethernet and VGA port but there is no Type A or HDMI. Also there are only 3 type c ports while xps 15 2in1 has four. ☆ No dedicated microphone mute key. I see that F9 does not have other command on it. I hope Dell would add the mute key on F9. ☆ Page up and Page down is integrated.

gqdeln,Dell,Nothing like this happens by mistake. There is usually a marketing ploy behind this. Check out the model numbers / names of HTC phones. Fortunately they confused people so much people stopped buying their phones and the business model tanked. I suspect that Dell wants to either reset the model numbers since their scheme led them down a cul de sac or they want to be able to clear out older models and stock by making it unclear which model is the newest. When they release a new model it takes time for the production process to ramp up become affordable and the market demand to grow. So they inevitably still have a few months supply of the previous model in the pipeline and probably not even made yet. But people typically want the newest model meaning they have to struggle to shift the older models which are more profitable when sold at full price but loss makers if have to be sold off in bulk to bulk purchases for clearance.,0.089,0.875,0.036,-0.7384,-1

There are also still thermal issues with this model especially with gaming but I don’t imagine it’s as bad as the higher core i7 and i9 models.

On the optimized mode I get 80 and 100fps respectively but CPU temps reach 99c and it throttles.

Car makers couldn't sell a single electric car if the batteries would be swelling after just a year or two. And surprisingly they are using the same type of batteries even in a worse environment. Sadly 3rd-party batteries tend to be even less reliable than Dell so better try local Dell service firstly. If they don't have one new not refurb or are not willing to sell it for a reasonable price roughly 100EUR range be persistent and give them a list of authorities and media where you're going to complain to. I understand relevant consumer protection legislation in EU is underway but not in power yet. Meanwhile discharge the battery slowly with the laptop idling and set max charge level in BIOS or Dell Command Power Manager to 0 or something very low use it with charger only.

gqrath,Dell,Lol why TF ur disabling Turbo Boost man that's like throwing your money out of the window! Anyway undervolt settings are different for each user because none of the CPU/GPU are made the same welcome to silicon lottery! . Basically you gotta figure out the undervolt setting for your laptop by yourself. Also if your laptop has the latest BIOS that may prevents you from undervolting due to plundervolt so downgrade to older BIOS If necessary. For CPU First turn back on Turbo boost and download throttlestop. For your starting point set the CPU and cache to -125mv and use TS Bench to to test CPU's stability. If 1 of the 3 tests give back error then you have to dial back the undervolt setting maybe to -100mv or whatever till the tests no longer produce errors. If the tests don't produce errors at -125mv setting then increase it to -130 -135 -140 etc. until your laptop BSOD. The trick is to undervolt as much as possible but undervolting too much is just as bad as disabling turbo boost. For GPU Undervolting GPU is a bit trickier but often time not necessary because Turing GPUs are easy to cool unless your laptop sucks donkey balls. For this you will need MSI afterburner. Tutorial on how to use it is over all the internet so just look it up. I think 925mv is the lowest you should go. After you done toying with your system you just perform a stress test using this guideline here and let it run for 20-30 minutes. It won't kill your laptop since it's as bad as playing AAA titles at ultra settings maybe even lighter in some cases . Make sure power management/fan setting is set to max so I can see the best your laptop can give. In HWInfo64 focus on CPU Package PoweGPU Package Power if supported . It should sustain 45W/80W respectively while running at 85-90 Celcius/70-80 Celcius respectively. Obviously with zero sign of thermal throttling. Any significant deviation means your laptop needs physical care such as repaste dust out fans whatever else. If you want your stress test result examined either PM me the screenshot of your stress test or join Suggest A Laptop discord.,0.112,0.751,0.136,0.8509,1

gqpg3w,Dell,I have this model with the smaller 56whr battery. I get around 7 hours just watching YouTube or Netflix at low brightness. There are also still thermal issues with this model especially with gaming but I don’t imagine it’s as bad as the higher core i7 and i9 models. Undervolting has been disabled on the latest dell BIOS but when I play game I either play on cool or optimized mode through dell power manager. For a little bit older games ex Planet Coaster and GTAV I get 60 and 80fps respectively on cool with CPU temps at around 65-80c. On the optimized mode I get 80 and 100fps respectively but CPU temps reach 99c and it throttles. I recommend playing on Cool for the best CPU temps and I haven’t tried Ultra Performance as I’m a bit nervous to do so for the CPU’s sake. If you downgrade the BIOS so you can undervolt you could easily game without throttling at much better temperatures. Good luck!,0.045,0.668,0.288,0.9935,1

gqk53g,Dell,I hate to break it to you... but a lot has changed in 15 years. No computer will reliably last that long now. Your average lifecycle on a machine will be 5 years - and that is pushing it. I would say go for the XPS and get the best graphics card you can put in it if you plan on going long term. The XPS hardware is significantly nicer than the G series gaming laptops. Since you aren't a gamer you will definitely appreciate the aesthetics as well. The G series gaming laptops are the budget line - below Alienware. It is in the same line as Inspiron laptops which are below the XPS line. I would say go with the XPS as you aren't going to see a noticeable difference between those two video cards if you don't do any serious gaming. They will both work fine for editing etc. Mostly software has not caught up to the raw power in the hardware so you should be fine for a few years. I would imagine this is a 9th gen i7 you are referring to? If you can get a 10th gen processor I would recommend it. Also be sure to check the Dell outlet for a machine as well as they are usually significantly cheaper there than new. If you do that also be sure to do a chat with a rep and ask for a better price as they will almost certainly take 5-10% off what is listed.,0.02,0.816,0.165,0.9893,1
gqk53g,Dell,I think that you need to to consider your use case here. If you're not a gamer and you're not doing any GPU heavy tasks like video editing or machine learning then a GPU will not be doing much for you. For a basic use case browsing the Internet word processing videos a CPU 8gb RAM and a solid state drive would be fine with no GPU the solid state drive will make the biggest performance difference here . You probably wouldn't need to spend much more than a few of hundred. In terms of latest features I'm not sure what you want but desktops tend to be expandable and it strikes me that there aren't really any latest features aside from the solid state drive and maybe a nice screen that will make much difference to you. All that said there are no guarantees any PC will last 10 years let alone 15. If you're feeling frugal the best thing to do would probably be to buy a cheaper desktop now for half the money and another when you need to several years down the line.,0.06,0.837,0.103,0.752,1
gpx2pu,Dell,I went from a 2015 MacBook to a Latitude 7450 after the MacBook keyboard and screen crapped out. I'd had Apple laptops for awhile. I guess I'm happy with the 7450. Has one of the best keyboards I have ever used. Oddly enough I got used to the 16 9 aspect ratio and prefer it now easier for documents side by side. And I like Windows 10 for the most part.

gpx2pu,Dell,I bought my first Mac almost 6 years ago and I'm quite happy with it. Although I don't know if I'm going to stick with it or go back to Linux and I was thinking getting a Dell. What I find amazing with Macs is that you have Unix environment in a machine that just works from the get-to. I really don't miss the adventure of having to find a distro where everything works or at least one that I have to tweak just one or two things in order to have a fully functional laptop. And one thing that I've never seen done properly with Linux is the sleep state. With my current Mac I don't remember the last time I shut it down and everything just works perfectly. I just close the lid and open the next day without any performance issues. How's your experience with that? Did you had any issues with peripherals not working?

gqdzlc,Dell,For a spec of a similar XPS 15 the XPS 17 will be about 200 more expensive. Two benefits of the XPS 17 are the fact that it has vapor chambers for cooling and an optional RTX 2060 graphics card. With that said video editing tends to be more CPU intensive than GPU intensive so I personally bought the XPS 15 with the 10875 processor and I'll end up putting either 32GB or 64GB of RAM in mine when it gets here. I travel quite a bit so lugging around a 17 laptop wasn't particularly ideal for me either.,0.031,0.94,0.03,-0.0333,0

gqdv0a,Dell,I recently got a g7 7590 that had better hardware than yours but same issues with fps. I've built desktops for years so I had a bunch of monitoring apps to troubleshoot. My laptop was reaching 100C during bootup so anytime a program would run there was extreme thermal throttling and power throttling. You can get realtemp 3.70 and run realtempgt for the temps. Look up how to run an elevated command prompt to get it to start with windows. Also go get Intel XTU and run the benchmark quickly. It will show whether you have thermal or power throttling. Hwinfo64 is another good monitoring app that reads way more sensors than necessary. What you want to check with that though is what peaks and where your processor clocks stop and your gpu clocks stop. For example when you run gta 5 if the computer hits 100c before max performance it will thermal throttle with dells proprietary software to try and keep the temps down but it doesn't work as intended because the fans take too long to run. If you have a major overheating problem then start a chat with Dell do a remote session and show them the temps by opening up a program. If that's the case it's either a hardware issue or bad thermal paste application at the factory. Other things to try that I've read about my machine would be to undervolt with throttlestop or Intel xtu reinstall windows to get all the Dell bloatware and power management software out create your own power plans that best match how you want to use the machine.,0.049,0.874,0.076,0.6858,1

Also the Dell apps aren't really bloatware since they're useful for the most part. You can also uninstall them manually rather than doing a drive format.

gq19uf,Dell,I'd probably get one of the previous models. Btw do you have a .edu email address from your college yet? I think Dell has college discounts. You should also consider getting a computer off the outlet site too which might save you a few more bucks.,0.0,0.928,0.072,0.4939,1
gq19uf,Dell,If it helps I’m also in the same situation and in Canada. I also bought the new XPS 15 a week ago with the second lowest spec. I did have a few coupons like the 100 of a purchase of 2000 and a 15% coupon. One thing I don’t like is that the spec I chose comes only with 8gb ram and 256gb storage whereas with the old XPS 15 you’d get more than that for less. I’m sure you could get a decent discount with the 10% student discount although when I tried it said the were out of codes. I’d also heavily recommend using the dell chat feature when buying I was offered 100 off when I negotiated with them but I’m sure you can get more of a discount if you stress that you’re a student and are stretching your budget to get this laptop. I’ve also heard there might be a Memorial Day sale? Not sure. Speaking of the model I was considered the old one as well but things like the aspect ratio and smaller size drew me to the new one. In addition I hope there’ll be improved cooling with the new model. I’m sure the old model would be fine too there’s a ton of user troubleshooting already done with it and other positives.,0.024,0.81,0.166,0.981,1
gq19uf,Dell,Advice of experience try to save a bit more and get the new one. I have been on a similar situation and ended up waiting a bit to buy the better laptop. The waiting now would be just a bit and you will have the better laptop for the next 3-5 years or even more . Dell also constantly has site wide discounts and if you buy the laptop by contacting a sales agent they can get you an additional 4% just ask them what’s the best price that they can give you since you’re on a tight budget. The improved display ratio keyboard and especially the trackpad will have an important impact on the usability.,0.0,0.849,0.151,0.9524,1
gq19uf,Dell,Me too was thinking to upgrade my 6 years MacAir and I was looking at the new XPS 15! But I’ve seen many people complain about how noisy the machine is even with a basic apps! So I just changed my mind and decided to go for last year MacPro,0.098,0.902,0.0,-0.5837,-1
gq19uf,Dell,I’m transferring into a CS program this Fall and was in the same boat. I pulled the trigger and ordered the 2020 XPS 15 with the i5 FHD display 32GB ram 1TB ssd. I’m upgrading from a mid 2012 MacBook Pro 13 and the new XPS had everything I was looking for including a 16 10 display. Hopefully it will arrive sometime next week. Not sure if you are able to in Canada but if you can get financing through Dell you could get 10% or more off the list price like I did. If you go this route you’ll need to chat with an online rep on the Dell website and negotiate until they give you a deal.,0.013,0.943,0.044,0.5602,1
gq19uf,Dell,I own the 2019 model of the XPS 15 with i7 and 1650 16GB RAM which I upgraded from 8GB and FHD non-touch display. And I'll list out the things that you'd have if you went with the 2020 models. Better thermals/performance If you're not planning on playing video games then you don't have to worry about this or demanding tasks. But if you do plan on playing video games the 2020 model would better since it has better thermals and a little bit better chipset. But the main advantage is the better thermals. You can still game on the 2019 model it will just get warmer and throttle at certain situations such as newer AAA titles. You're fine with older or lighter games. Audio Gonna be honest the speakers on the 2019 ones are pretty bad. From the reviews that I've seen 2020 ones are really promising. Display/design You'll do fine with the display of the 2019 model. But 16 10 does look really sweet along with the gigantic trackpad. But on the other side you're going to lose some valuable ports. Windows hello facial recognition is a good bonus. If I were in 2019 about to buy the new XPS 15 but I also knew that the 2020 model would be a major redesign I would've waited another year and just stick with my old laptop for another year. I don't know how much you can manage with your current laptop but a year from now the XPS would be a lot cheaper and even if Dell comes up with a new laptop I doubt that it will be much different from this years model. Or can stick with your Macbook only until the winter semester. Dell laptop usually get cheaper around holiday season.,0.037,0.842,0.121,0.9565,1

gputnx,Dell,if you read the details of the recent bios update you just did intel removed the ability to undervolt. no undervolt awful thermal management in xps laptops lots of overheating which can lead to consistently high fan speeds. i personally downgraded my bios after finding out my undervolts no longer worked and you need to go into bios settings upon boot to restore back to defaults or else it will keep the undervolt restriction from the 1.16 update. you can find videos online or search google for others dealing with this issue. id recommend opening your laptop and cleaning it using pressurized air carefully . make sure to unplug the battery when you open it to be sure you dont damage any of the components incidentally. if there are thermal problems with your laptop id recommend repasting the thermal paste and replacing the thermal pads as well as adding thermal pads to the VRM's to transfer heat to the case of the laptop. i did this recently and saw a 20deg celcius decrease in overall temps. im now down to 40deg C idle and 60-70deg C while gaming. GTA V runs 70 fps high settings with peak CPU temps of 75 usually between 68-70. the xps lineup unfortunately has incredibly bad thermal throttling especially over time so it's worth looking into imo edit i know you said you dont want to undervolt or repaste but you are quite literally leaving yourself with no significant options to decrease temperatures if you rule out those off the bat,0.063,0.857,0.08,0.1395,1

gpxqgy,Dell,Why are you asking all of this after having bought the laptop already? I just don't want it to run extremely hot Laptops are designed to run hot. A laptop being hot isn't a bad thing it's doing exactly what it is intended running as fast as possible up to the designated thermal limit. There is no product-life-threatening aspect of it running hot. Will it run hotter if you cover the vents with your legs while playing a game? yes. duh. But you can run it hot all day and that won't do anything adverse to your device. I've probably logged over 400 hours on my 9570 doing 4k-video rendering where it's run flat-out for dozens of hours at a time. Nothing happens. I'm also wondering about the portability You can easily find out the dimensions of what you bought by looking online. Why didn't you do this before buying it? The XPS is designed to be a portable and powerful laptop. It's not a gaming laptop those are far less portable. Is it a laptop? Yes. It's very portable. I've heard that these tend to suffer from not the best thermals and some throttling Why does this matter to you? It throttles under heavy load. So what? it's not going to throttle while browsing watching movies or audio engineering. Will it throttle if you play a AAA game that absolutely maxes out the computer? Yes. It's going to run right up to the limit. As intended. Overwatch and The Sims it can play no problem at all. It can play Rise of the Tomb Raider 1080p at 50fps. It can play Far Cry 4 5. It can play most AAA games from a few years ago. ,0.059,0.829,0.111,0.9162,1
gpxqgy,Dell,Gaming shouldn't be an issue it'll get hot but that's every computer. It'll get a tad warm at most when doing simple web browsing. Using any laptop on a couch or bed will get warmer than normal because when it's not on a flat surface the air flow isn't optimal so give space for the fans.

gpl2ma,Dell,That website is incorrect. The Quadro RTX 3000 has equally as many shaders as does the GeForce RTX 2060 in fact they are exactly the same card I owned the Quadro RTX 3000 albeit in the thicker and heavier Precision 7530 here are some benchmarks vis-à-vis the Quadro P3200 same card as notebook GTX 1060 mobile and the Quadro RTX 5000 same card as desktop RTX 2080 SUPER . Open the three orange spoilers for the actual results. In fact the Quadro RTX 3000 and 5000 perform worse than they're supposed to because of the neutered power limit compared to the desktop cards. The RTX 5000 I currently own has 3072 shaders and 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM but the 80 W power limit means it performs like a desktop RTX 2060 SUPER achieving little more than 18000 in Fire Strike Graphics. The desktop RTX 5000 has as many shaders and as much VRAM and runs at a whopping 265 W TGP and destroys the RTX 2080 in benchmarks. To answer your other questions Programming robot simulations lil' gaming and a lil' machine learning majority I do in the cloud . This is precisely my use case. I run CUDA simulations write OpenGL D3D12 projects and am getting into 3D modelling rendering and ray-tracing too. I also play my fair share of games. AC Odyssey runs at high settings 60 FPS 1080p Witcher 3 runs at ultra settings 60-70 FPS 1080p Shadow of the Tomb Raider runs at 50-60 FPS Ultra settings 1080p Control before DLSS 2.0 runs at high settings no ray-tracing at 45-60 FPS 1080p Kingdom Come Deliverance runs at high settings 45-60 FPS 1080p. This is a variety of the games I am currently playing. Overall games are certainly playable at higher FPS if you turn down some settings and accept the quality drop. I wouldn't buy the Precisions just for the Quadro but rather for the incredible business-class customer support make sure you get ProSupport Plus with Accidental Damage for 3 years at least and generally better QC and QA than the XPS. They're exactly the same chassis but the Precision name is more important to Dell. That said if you are bent on getting a 17 machine with high performance why not get the 7750 instead? You get options to go up to the Quadro RTX 5000 can upgrade the memory displays SSDs M.2 WiFi cards you name it...,0.053,0.846,0.1,0.9685,1
gpl2ma,Dell,Considering you'll be equally thermally constrained in both setups I doubt you will see much of a performance gain from the Quadro RTX 3000 Mobile . It all depends on how well Dell has tuned these GPUs as it's highly unlikely that you will be able to hit 80W on the GPU as well as 35-100W on the CPU without crashing the limits of the cooling.,0.056,0.835,0.109,0.5719,1
gpl2ma,Dell,rtx 2060 and quadro rtx 3000 are the same core TU106 the quadro does not have more shaders or pipelines i'm not sure where you got that info from. They are going to perform nearly identically I would say with how nvidia's boost works. Also killer 1650 is just a rebranded intel chipset it likely works good in linux killer no longer uses qualcomm for their wifi6 generation. Even then you can just buy an AX200/201 intel card for 20 if you really want that instead. Just get the XPS 17 the precision has no advantages for your use case,0.132,0.783,0.085,-0.7406,-1

gpn6sv,Dell,Well...I hope you're trying other means to bring down the heat by placing the laptop in such a way that allows proper ventilation. They are just basic things which I have tried but still didn't help my overheating issue. I have contacted the customer service and I haven't even got to the part where they asked me to service yet..so seeing your situation..idk if that would work out too. Just got a message that since I bought my laptop from USA and now I'm in India the international warranty won't apply..if you know anything about checking that...Lemme know The other things the customer service helped me with is how we can disable the turboboost of the processor from the BIOS setup. That did help in maintaining the temperature. The gameplay won't be affected that much and I read elsewhere that it's actually better for it to be disabled but do read about those things on your own. I feel that I shouldn't have to pay extra for an i7 9750H when I'm not going to use it to it's full capacity...so I asked them to fix the issue in some other way...that's when I got the message about the international warranty. It's definitely a good solution and will help you get through the days till you get a proper solution from dell.

gphpdx,Dell,What I would do is to find out how much the battery wear is. I have BatteryBar and it displays it in their program all the time. If the battery wear is high you may just have a faulty battery replacing the battery with a new OEM one will be an easy fix if there isn't much battery wear it could be something else.,0.036,0.918,0.046,0.1531,1
gphpdx,Dell,Unfortunately the battery life on the 7390 is terrible. The one thing that is majorly flawed. You’ll have to be extremely conservative and maybe even make sacrifices to have anything near average battery life on one single full charge. I wish I could offer you a solution to your problem because I certainly searched for it every possible way. But as you said continue to play with the dell power management tool to optimize your laptop. Mix a little undervolting in there if you’ll like too.,0.086,0.752,0.162,0.743,1
gphpdx,Dell,I have the same model and 3 hours is too little. I get 5-6 with moderate use meaning things like listening to music browsing the web note taking and reading. This is also with the Better battery setting. I don't know too much about what can cause these kinds of issues but sometimes there are programs and services running in the background that are draining the battery. You might explore this possibility if you haven't already. Also check to make sure you're using the default Balanced power plan in Windows and that Thermal Management is set to Optimized in Dell Power Manager.,0.0,0.898,0.102,0.8641,1
gphpdx,Dell,It seems battery life widely varies per person. Mine was definitely 5-6 hours when new FHD I cannot imagine getting the same with the 4k version so 3 to 4 hours seems about accurate in case we use our laptops similarly. ThrottleStop and Dells Power Management features can definitely help extend the battery life a little however. Unfortunately my battery health just degraded in a weeks time with 32% and the battery life has been 3 hours max now after 5 months of usage . I am so disappointed.. Dells support is looking into it now but their first support agent said this was 'normal'.,0.033,0.844,0.123,0.8109,1
gphpdx,Dell,You battery life is terrible ! I previously had the 4K version and I agree the battery life is bad 5 ish hours . Run sleep study report after a sleep session to see exactly if the laptop was idle. Also try to undervolt it helps battery life and performance. Also check that you are not in max performance mode in dell power manager for battery life go in quiet mode . You should also check if you do not have any background apps that are active when using your laptop maybe something is taking some of your CPU usage. I now have the FHD model and the battery is way better around 7-8 hours for the same usage however i do notice the slight screen difference but you get used to it after couple of days. If you can i would suggest swapping for a FHD model buy and sell yours on ebay you might make a small profit out of it I do not regret at all my decision.,0.025,0.889,0.086,0.8477,1

Many enterprises I know rely on it for end user machines without issue. Macafees ok but its another program and its not as optimized or integrated w/ the OS. The Malwarebytes recommendation below is also good supplement. As for the torrent probably fine. If you're concerned I'd take advantage of one of the semi virtualization options in Windows. You could set up WSL and export an image with a torrent client and then delete and re-import it as necessary. Windows sandbox is a good option here. Or go as far as setting up a complete VM on Hyper-V for full isolation As for the phone discussion for you and the other poster suggest checking out Microsoft's Your Phone program if you haven't already.

gp6srg,Dell,Your title and wattage question is one thing. Not charging past 70% is something completely different. Either way regarding both the wattage question and not charging past 70% the answer is absolutely not . While slower charge cycles may help maintain your battery health you still MUST USE THE POWER ADAPTER THAT YOUR SYSTEM REQUIRES . The wattage is not only required for charging. It’s for running the rest of your system CPU RAM graphics display etc. Do not use a lower wattage power adapter. Long answer Always fully charge your battery whenever you plug it in. Never partially charge the battery. When you do plug it in to charge wait until the battery is fully charged before unplugging the charger and using the system on battery power again. Never use the “express” or “fast” charge options in the BIOS or in Windows. Always use the slowest charge method that is available. Faster charge cycles wear a battery out quicker. If the battery is easily removable removing it entirely once it is fully charged while the system is plugged and turned on will keep the battery from wearing. Systems can pull power from both battery and AC power simultaneously while the system is running hint this happens when you use aftermarket or undersized power adapters so your best bet is to simply disconnect the battery or turn off charging if this is at all possible. Most systems have a battery charge disable option. Do some research on how to disable battery charging. If you do need to charge the battery don’t do it while you are using the system. It’s always best to charge the battery whenever the system is not in use so try not to use the system while the battery is charging. If you need to use the system remove the battery or disable charging if you can. Try to wait until the battery has discharged at least 20% before recharging it. Short charge/discharge cycles quickly wear out the battery. It’s actually better to fully discharge your battery before charging it again to avoid those short discharge/charge cycles. You should also calibrate your battery once a month for heavy battery users or every other month if you use the battery less often. Follow this link for detailed instructions on how to properly calibrate your battery. As you can see proper battery charging techniques is only one step of many when it comes to battery maintenance and maximizing performance. However please use the adapter that your system shipped with and do not use a lower wattage or aftermarket adapter or you run the risk of not only destroying your battery but also burning the adapter and catching a fire. Simply don’t do it. And while we’re on the subject of aftermarket power adapters let me say repeat do not use aftermarket or undersized power adapters or they will turn your battery into an spicypillows,0.019,0.945,0.036,0.7299,1
gp6srg,Dell,No I don't see why it would work that way. Wattage is a measure of the rate of energy transfer i.e. capacity. A 130w power supply can supply 130w but the device will only draw up to what it needs to function and no more.,0.098,0.868,0.034,-0.431,-1

gor7gy,Dell,Hi I've got Vostro 7590 with WD19TB and LG 34GK950F-B with HDR VESA 400 . The monitor is connected to one of the Display Ports at the back of the docking station. I remember that after a clean install of Windows from a Microsoft iso I allowed the OS to install all the updates from the App Store plus I installed drivers suggested by Dell Update app together with the newest firmware mind the undervolting issues though . I once for giggles went to Display Settings and enabled two HDR options for both displays streaming and something else . It worked the LG OSD confirmed it was now working in the HDR mode but the image quality was so poor and the colors were so washed out and uncalibrated that I never bothered to enable it again and soon after I installed Linux. But yeah it has worked for me.,0.037,0.906,0.057,0.0016,0
gouygs,Dell,They look pretty much the same to me. They even have identical service manual images. I think the Vostro might have better support or something since it's geared towards small businesses instead of regular consumers. Also I think the colors are different - the Inspiron has a white logo instead of a black one on the Vostro and the textures might be different? Typically small business laptops are slightly better built than consumer laptops but I'm not sure if this is the case for Vostro vs. Inspiron and I know many of the Vostro models are the same as the Inspirons. If you don't see any differences in the spec sheet and the support is the same they're probably pretty much the same i.e. no differences in RAM CPU etc - just get whichever one is cheaper. Edit Also if you're buying from the website might be worth talking to support to see if you can get a price cut - I talked to the work customer support for my Latitude and got a fat discount. ,0.042,0.822,0.135,0.9456,1

They are completely the same apart from the cover material even the bios upgrades are called Inspiron/Vostro 7590. I don't remember which one is made of what but I prefer my Vostro to the carbon fiber on XPS laptops for sure - it's not leaving fingermarks on the surface so much after touching it. x200B Everything is of metal I think it is aluminum apart from the plastic display frame and with every day I'm getting happier with the laptop. The keys are made of metal too. It feels very solid in hands definitely not plastic-ish. x200B Please mind that I bought it from the business section of Dell website so it asked me to put company details.

gotro5,Dell,The most concerning points are the battery drain and text appearance. I’m owning a 4K version which gives 6h regular use according to batteryreport. If you are fine with the batter life or it is constantly on a charger then definitely go for 4K. About text on a 27 in monitor you can clearly see the difference in 1080p from that on a higher resolution screen. On win10 1080p on a 2k or higher res screen aka downsampling looks even worse and text looks a lot more blurred than on an original 1080p screen due to its rendering approach. So in my mind 4K could come better in your case.,0.027,0.863,0.109,0.8074,1

gotro5,Dell,I've had both FHD and 4K of the XPS 7390 2 in 1 and I can tell you there is a difference. Small difference but it is there. I had the 4K for 4 months and wanted to change for FHD to get more battery life. The 4K screen has much more details its visible dont get fooled by online reviews that say its not noticable . The 4K is better for visualising articles or webpages however watching videos its not really a big difference. However you get really used to the FHD and I think the trade off for the battery life is so much worth it. If you never had a 4K display before go for the FHD. If battery life is a concern go for FHD. Otherwise go for 4K.,0.0,0.927,0.073,0.8553,1

gosm40,Dell,To get a Bitlocker recovery code two options Open PowerShell or CommandPrompt as an admin and enter command manage-bde -protectors -get C swap the C if you have a different OS partition . The recovery code will be listed under numerical password. Go to Settings the modern Windows 10 one then Updates Security then the device encryption tab. On the right side under related settings it will say Bitlocker settings. Hit that then an option will pop up allowing you to print recovery key or save to a file. Possibly will also let you back up to a Microsoft account. If it doesn't I think your only option assuming Win 10 Home is turning off Bitlocker waiting for it to decrypt and then turning it back on. This will auto add the key a new different one to your MS account. And you have to check with the specific Linux distribution if it has Secure boot enabled.

gomlpm,Dell,XPS can even output 4K 60Hz if you get the right adapter. A dock has the advantage of giving your more ports ethernet and power delivery as well one cable to rule them all.

I hooked up an Gig ethernet USB adapter to the monitor for wired networking that works well with full speed.

Boy was I wrong - all I've had was issue after issue after issue - fingerprint sensor going out on me RAM issues headphone jack not working etc. I sent it in for repair twice and still had issues. Had muliple support sessions with Dell but they only helped me with the hardware because I only had a hardware warranty. They tried selling me a 300 software warranty but I told them I'd figure out the issue on my own and hung up. A few days ago I got the notification that my warranty was expiring in 10 days.

gop9jd,Dell,I had this problem and others relating to BIOS . Did it attempt a BIOS update right before this started happening? What I recall is that the installed BIOS didn't like to do firmware updates and it would get stuck on reboot trying to apply the same update AFAIK . You can try a few things 1. use the BIOS recovery process where you put the BIOS you want on a usb stick and use the special power-buton-key-combo to turn it on and into recovery mode then flash from that. 2. Let the computer sit in this hung state for 1-2 hours. Mine actually took that long to do whatever tf it needed to do to finish then it started normally. 3. As another poster said try resetting BIOS to default and then don't touch em. Defaults seems to be the only settings they actually test to be working because ordinary custom settings would create long hangs on a variety of operations. 4. You can try other versions of the BIOS including earlier than what you have but beware the Dell Command Update utility trying to patch it back to the version you're having the problem with and then more hangs .

gnyb68,Dell,I was aware of this stat before purchasing an XPS 13 recently. I was not terribly pleased with it but it seems to be an industry norm for non-Apple laptops. The upside of this is that the batteries in most Dell models really is pretty easy to swap out and replacements are not terribly expensive. If you can swap RAM or and SSD in your laptop you can do a battery replacement.,0.021,0.795,0.184,0.9338,1
gnyb68,Dell,Seems to be a lot of misunderstanding around what this rating means. 300 discharge/charge cycles the amount of times you can fully drain then fully charge the battery before capacity will noticeably start to degrade. ie if you've gone through 250 cycles you can still expect to have close to full battery capacity. 400 or 500 cycles the battery will be far below 100%. This is pretty standard across the industry across most devices. Notable exceptions are many mobile phones and some Apple products. I understand Dell and other OEMs also offer long-lifecycle batteries with 1 000 cycle rating on their commercial products. If you're really worried about battery longevity recommend disabling any 'fast-charge' settings.

Were any recent hardware software changes or updates performed on the system before the issue occurred? We can measure the system temperature via hardware diagnostics. You can visit the following link to find how to run it dell.to/30NTWxR Please keep the adapter connected to the computer while running the test. Also you don't need to run the extended memory test. Once completed click on the arrow mark on the bottom right side of the screen and go to System health to check the temperature readings.

goja64,Dell,If you're talking about the black carbon fiber vs the white glass fiber here's my thoughts. I have the white glass fiber. It feels like a textured hard plastic smooth but you can feel the weave. Reports say it stays surprisingly clean for being white. Fingerprints are not visible at all as far as I can tell. The backlight however can make the white keys difficult to see in certain lighting. I have not used the black carbon fiber but what I've read is that it's a more rubberized texture and it can show fingerprints and oils. Overall I'm happy with my white glass fiber version.,0.039,0.823,0.138,0.9072,1

goja64,Dell,I once had a silver Samsung laptop with silver key caps and every time the backlight came on it was nearly useless because you couldn’t see the lettering or lights because the backlight and keys were close to the same color. Everything else I loved about the laptop but they key color made me hate it. I eventually found a keyboard on eBay from a later model that had dark grey keys bought it for 35 and spent 2 hours carefully replacing the key caps with the dark ones. After that it was perfect. The entire keyboard assembly should have been easier to replace than the key apps but it was somehow riveted/glued to other components that made removing it very difficult.

go9eq3,Dell,Always create a restore point. A good idea to get the drivers updated. Didn't they update during the install process? You can always roll back a driver that isn't performing. And again create a restore point. I had to use one today because I'm having issues with my wifi. Been working on that all damn week! System restore only option that works but that's my problem. Intel kept giving me an update on the graphic driver and I lost scuzzy zoom in Adobe Illustrator. I reported it every time and finally they got a newer driver and it worked.

gobcl7,Dell,It's funny that people are complaining about that. Everyone I have talked to who has used a laptop with a number pad can't stand them because it means the keyboard is off center from the display which is a very unnatural typing position. I can see that some people might need it if they're doing 10-key or similar work but that is fairly unlikely on a laptop. Most people I know who want a number pad either have a full-sized external keyboard for their desk and/or have purchased a portable number pad to carry with the laptop.

go4lv0,Dell,More info needed on what cpu it has. The i7 9750h I have has an max turbo of 4 5ghz if only one core is active with all cores active the turbo is max 4 0ghz. It will be hard hard to keep it at 4 0ghz stable because of power limits and temperatures. As for as I know the 3590 doesn't come with cpu that can be overclocked so there is no way to set the minimal clock speed at 4 ghz. You can set speedshift to 0 in trottlestop so it will try to keep the speeds as high as possible but throttling will happen at some point. Thermals in the 3590 aren't that great with the shared heatpipes. I put max turbo speed at 3 2ghz on all cores and it manages to keep it that way for 95% of the time while gaming without going over 70 C.,0.056,0.888,0.055,-0.0446,0

It's not specific to your computer so it probably won't help to go through tech support unless they can recommend a driver or setting fix. As far as I can see I'm using the newest drivers and I've tried manipulating all the settings which there aren't very many of anyway. I've troubleshooted down to it being a bluetooth issue in some fashion. My mouse connects either through the computer blouetooth or through a USB receiver.

gnspk7,Dell,Significantly better screen and brightness. And this might sound stupid but you'd be surprised how many people care a lot about this - LOOKS. The sleek metallic clean finish matters a lot these days. Also significantly thinner bezels. The XPS 15 also comes with a 1650 Ti which is better than a 1650 Max Q in the ThinkPad and 10th gen Intel processors compared to the 9th gen of the ThinkPad,0.028,0.729,0.242,0.9408,1
gnspk7,Dell,I'm a big XPS hater here due to a mediocre experience with the 9570's QC and bad product design but objectively speaking there are solid tradeoffs while an updated X1E doesn't release. Major two points for the XPS would be 10th gen H series CPUs 45W with 8-core options and the 16 10 bezel-less form factor. Other than that there are a lot more good and bad things. For the good touchpad is huge and best-in-class class being not a Mac probably much better speakers finally but still no Macs dual M.2 not sure on the 15 . Also that dual Thunderbolt3 and right-side usb-c with DP and PD not a typo . Also eGPUs should be really nice on 10th gen. For the bad you can't get it in black Precision-line exclusive again metal frame makes it heavy despite smaller profile Wifi NIC is now soldered it didn't get significantly upgraded thermals like the 17's vapor chamber and worst of the worst vs a Thinkpad - the keyboard experience will be a downgrade you may not cope with. Oh and pricing so far seems pretty stupid but then again so is Thinkpad's X1 line. And you'll have to buy some legacy port adapters but well it's that Macbook-induced future now and I don't hate this change. As for the X1E there are probably promos since it's been out for a while it still has a trackpoint if you use it and that KILLER keyboard it's black and sleek-looking and the materials make it feel exactly the amount of light and rigid a laptop should be too much density makes laptops more fragile and harder to carry in hand . Screen has nice options particularly for pros who work under strong daylight or need privacy guard. I also personally believe QC and support are still better on Lenovo but that varies by region and of course how relevant you are for their reps individual vs large business purchase... . For the bad well everything not good from the Dell and likely price. But then again Thinkpads actually sell REALLY WELL and expensive even 2-4y after launch not something you can say for the 1.3k fully loaded 9560/70's original price double that on ebay with refurb warranty and all.

gnspk7,Dell,I'm looking to upgrade my Thinkpad X1 Carbon 5th gen. Ive realized that I'm using my laptop more and more and an Ultrabook is simply not able to cope with the workload I throw at it. I'm curious about what workloads your X1C isn't dealing with and if they're anything more than CPU limitations. My wife's laptop is a 5th gen X1C and my only real complaint about it is that it's only a dual core solved in Gen6 and later and the lack of an even moderately powerful GPU. The Gen7 and Gen8 X1C are pretty much indistinguishable other than some vPro-style enterprise features since the Gen8 won't be getting Ice Lake. TBH that's the only deal breaker for me. The X1C is the perfect size and weight the 14 display is big enough but not too big the SSDs are fast enough battery life is outstanding the hardware is solid port selection is great the trackpad is as good as the ones on my Surface and pretty close to the ones on the MacBooks I've had. I just need more GPU power than I get with the UHD 620. Ice Lake would do it. Ryzen 4000 would do it. Sadly it seems the X1C is getting neither this year. The XPS13 first caught my eye since it has Ice Lake but the slightly smaller screen even at 16 10 is a bit of a turnoff. The XPS15 looks much better and is barely larger than an X1C though much heavier. The flip side is you can buy it at 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD and then upgrade it yourself to save a lot of money. Anyway I ramble.,0.023,0.848,0.129,0.9861,1

In my opinion I don’t think it’s worth it just for a 1080p ips screen on a 12 inch laptop unless you’re doing work like photo/video editing that require color accurate screens but you probably won’t be doing that since it’s not that powerful of a laptop.,0.034,0.896,0.071,0.0777,1

My XPS with a 6 core i7 16 gb of ram and 512 gb SSD WAS 1850 to get a 9510 with the same specs is 2400 and that is also with slower DDR3 RAM no GPU a less bright screen 400 vs 500 nits and a smaller battery.

gnsie6,Dell,ProSupport is business-class support. 1. You get a 24/7 hotline that is still manned despite COVID-19 and you can talk to an agent that's local to your country or at least region and not a crappy outsourced one. 2. If you get Accidental Damage coverage ProSupport Plus they fix/replace your machines regardless of what you do to it coffee spills cracked screens broken hinges on purpose etc . 3. Any repairs are done on-site free of charge. If the warehouse in your country has the parts available locally you can get the repair person the next day and things can be fixed. If you want to repair things yourself that is perfectly possible too just ask for parts-only during your call to the CS officer when reporting a need to repair.

gnsie6,Dell,My experience has been great and i do always recommed ProSupportPlus with Next Business Day Repair. Experience in Ireland and Spain x200B I personally saw the difference between prosupportplus you speak with someone in the US that know his shit and they go for repair when asked for or necessary sending a engineer. Normal ProSupport im always speaking with someone in India. When you can for something they always send a engineers and may replace parts that you dont actually need to just in case. You call sometimes for a fan noise and end up with a whole new assembly. x200B Two different experience i prefer the profesionalisme of the US guys but indian guys are also pro and always email you solution few hours or days after. Dell hardware support is awesome. Software support is not as good. x200B If you need w10... definetly the way to go.

gnew91,Dell,I think you could make a case either way. I plan on doing mostly programming on mine and am leaning towards the 4K because I don’t usually use an external monitor so the 4k would let me see more lines of code at a time.

gnew91,Dell,Honestly I think the 1080 version is better if money is an issue. I don’t want to make any promises but if you can’t shake the bug of wanting a 4K screen it will always be possible to order one online and install it with relatively minimal effort. I did that when I found a second hand screen for a hundred bucks XPS 15 9650 . The process was surprisingly easy. Just disconnect and remove one screen and then connect the other.

gni5ad,Dell,I know the cards to some degree do share the load I've always assumed my discrete graphics focused on the heavier 3D lifting while the integrated handled more of the Windows Aero / Explorer load. That being said you should see the discrete card taking the number crunching on. If for some reason it isn't I think you might want to make sure that the necessary configuration is made to have the system prefer that card. I'm not sure of the verbiage on an ATI model as I have a NVIDIA card in all of my various systems. In NVIDIA it's something to the effect of Prefer High Performance Processor . Another possibility is thermal throttling occurring which you should be able to determine by getting the Intel XTU and monitoring your card during gameplay. For me I had to undervolt my Dell XPS 15 to some degree for more stable performance. Additionally and this may be contentious I disable TurboBoost in the BIOS. I find the short burst of performance overpowers the thermals on my Dell XPS and I'd rather have a steady clock speed and predictable thermal variables. Finally I found that I often had better performance using the Dell drivers for the video card. I know that is also somewhat sacrosanct in the PC world and I don't do the same thing on my Dell G5 gaming PC or on a Dell XPS or Alienware tower. For whatever reason I see better more predictable performance on my Dell XPS with the Dell provided ones. They seem to update enough that I don't feel left behind and I run into far less problems.

I also am having problems with my AUX connection where no sound will play out of the speakers after disconnecting and sometimes produces the BSOD. A technician came round yesterday to try and fix both problems - he replaced the mother and daughter board. Anyway long story short the issue is still there and my laptop has been damaged cosmetic in many ways as a result of poor work by the technician. The lid does not fully close on the RHS the trackpad R click gets stuck when pushed down and there are scratches all around the bottom casing from him using a screwdriver to pop the case off. I am really fed up as I thought both issues would be fixed or at best the issues would still be there but I did NOT expect to have my brand new laptop damaged by a certified dell technician.,0.158,0.79,0.052,-0.9688,-1

gn7lcf,Dell,Connected standby is consuming too much battery when the machine is turned off completely. If the computer is in connected modern standby then it's not off. It's largely business as usual but with the screen disabled. Certain services shut off and the hardware goes into a low power mode but it's still sitting there checking your email periodically listening for other notifications and generally doing stuff you didn't actually want when you put it in suspend in the first place. Microsoft claims a laptop can stay in this mode for a week or more but my experience is that every Monday morning your battery will be nearly dead. How am I sure the machine was off?

gmp6vs,Dell,I have both a Macbook Pro and an XPS and I prefer the carbon fiber on the XPS. It looks great imo. While the all-aluminium design on the Macbook also looks great but it's cold to the touch and feels slippery. My palms after shift while I'm typing on the Macbook and I've never had that problem while typing on the XPS. The Macbook excels in two main places the trackpad and the speakers. I have the butterfly keyboard model so I can't comment on the new Magic Keyboard . The trackpad is great it's large and it has a satisfying click that's not too obnoxious. The trackpad on the XPS is great for a Windows machine. Compared to the Macbook it's good but not great. It's a little too small for my liking and the click is a little too loud for me. The speakers on the Macbook are phenomenal. The XPS pales in comparison it just sounds worse. The thing is I almost never use the speakers. I have earbuds that I just plug and play. The only time I would ever use my speakers was if I was in a presentation and I needed to play a video to an audience - the XPS speakers are decent enough. Some might say but the Macbook build quality is SO much better than the XPS . There is 0 chassis flex on either machine both feel rigid and sturdy - something a 1000 laptop should feel like. How about the webcam! The nosecam is god-awful on the XPS The XPS has a nosecam but it also has Windows Hello and in my experience Hello works flawlessly even if the webcam is at the bottom of the screen. I use my laptop far away enough so that the nosecam isn't even a nosecam but more like a chincam which you can still see my face - perfectly acceptable for any conference call. Macbooks don't get viruses and are long-lasting machines that have 0 problems! Look at my comment below about QC control on the XPS lineup. As for the no-viruses a recent study by malwarebytes one of the world's leading antimalware company found that MacOS has more viruses than Windows As for the Windows gets viruses take a look at this Windows Defender is awesome and after using Windows machines for over 4 years I've had 0 malware/virus issues even after pirating/torrenting on sketchy sites. Windows Update has never updated without my permission even when it's a urgent security update. People forget there's a simple setting to turn off automatic updates. Because I don't want to rant more and I ran out of time the XPS lineup is on par with the Macbook. If you prefer MacOS you know what to do. If you prefer Windows you also know what to do. Both are excellent machines and I'm sure you'll do just fine if you go with either of them.,0.025,0.789,0.186,0.9982,1

gmp6vs,Dell,Wow I was thinking of getting an XPS laptop but your post made me sceptical. I have a 3-year-old Inspiron 5000 and I'm quite satisfied by it at the moment my only serious complaint is the screen which is quite terrible but I got incredible value for money when I was buying it so I overlook it to be honest. I was thinking of upgrading to a laptop with H-series processors so my simulations could run faster plus I want one with keyboard backlighting and a good screen.

gn3l83,Dell,Indesign in particular makes it sound like you're doing lots of visual work that lots of people are going to be seeing e.g customer facing maybe even stuff for print. So I'm going to second Lordship Mern's recommendation of UP2716D which notably gives full aRGB/NTSC coverage and much better DCI-P3 coverage. USB-C doesn't matter for XPS 15 since you can't charge the laptop properly with any monitor so you can just use a 10 USB-C dongle problem solved . If we're just comparing the P2720DC and U2719DC... Hmmm. Honestly no meaningful difference except that the U series supports Daisy Chain which could be handy if you ever want a second FHD or QHD monitor. P2720DC is overall very nice. Out of the box it'll give 100% sRGB/72% NTSC at 6500K with 2 dE. This is very good and calibration beyond this point will not matter. The U2719DC does not offer meaningful color advantages. Also U and P series have similarly high quality standards with the same warranties 3 year with advanced exchange the same dead pixel guarantees etc. P series is Dell's primary line of business monitors. In this market reliability is a very high priority . No difference here. But again with your described use case I would recommend a wide gamut monitor like the UP2716D over either of these choices.,0.058,0.796,0.146,0.9576,1

gmm3vx,Dell,I'm running the latest BIOS that patched the plundervolt exploit probably 2 updates ago and throttlestop still works but it quits once every few days now. Since Intel also puts out an undervolting/overclocking app Intel XTU I'm holding out hope that they won't completely block the ability to undervolt but instead create a workaround that limits or ideally addresses the security vulnerability that it poses while still allowing regular users the ability to undervolt.,0.039,0.7,0.26,0.9677,1
gmm3vx,Dell,Maybe. Ice Lake isn't affected by Plundervolt so as more 10nm chips are available there will be fewer systems where blocking undervolting is required but that doesn't mean that manufacturers won't do it anyway. Ideally manufacturers would just expose it as a BIOS option mitigated by default but with a user option to disable but that's not likely to happen.,0.059,0.862,0.079,0.3009,1

gmx5ps,Dell,If the battery is degrading work with Dell support. If that's not it... Based on my fans also seem to be running louder and more often I'm suspicious of some rogue application loading up your CPU all the time. Open your task manager when the machine should be idle but the fans are running and identify the process that's using the most CPU. Regarding even with CPU usage under 10% 10% is measured against the clock speed of your CPU. If the CPU is running full-tilt all the time then that at a 10% load indicates something is using the CPU when it should be idle which would drain the battery fast. OTOH if you're talking about 10% while the CPU is throttled way down and you're doing something else that would explain that 10% like watching a video then this might not be the culprit.,0.029,0.937,0.034,0.2067,1

gmh26m,Dell,This means the system during post cannot figure out what Charger is plugged in and adjust how it powers your system. The system will try and use the charger but it usually will not charge the battery at all in this state if it uses the power adapter at all you can just tell the system to continue and that will let it boot to the OS and what happens then is hoping it works fine. I would disconnect your charger from your computer and from the wall outlet check the charger for any damage anywhere. Move to a different wall outlet. Make sure it’s a dell charger that is at least 45 watts. You may need to do a bios update also but that needs a good charger to do so on dell systems. It’s possible the charger itself has gone bad or a connection on the motherboard/ within the charging circuit has failed.

gmh26m,Dell,I get this when I power it with a cigarette lighter adapter in the car. All it means is that the laptop is all startled not to be getting as much juice as usual but will make do with what's available. For example my adapter can put out 36W. The computer can take up to 45 so it's all like WTF. However it runs idle at 10W display on and can maybe get up to 40 when I'm playing games. So maybe when I'm playing games the laptop is discharging even though it's plugged. But most the time it's charging.

gmmuth,Dell,Are the prices really that close in Europe? A decent mbp 16 in the us is over 3k but I can configure a pretty solid xps 15 9500 for under 2 500. I’m trying to make the same decision but I’m also considering the xps 17. A couple things that are still making me lean towards xps are the discounts you can get at least here in the US—a 10% off coupon another 100 off for dell financing plus cash back through rakuten. And you can save money by upgrading parts of the xps later. I can do 16gb ram and 512gb ssd and upgrade them later myself if I end up needing more. For the mbp if you think you MIGHT need certain storage or specs you need to buy it that way because you can’t upgrade it yourself. And Apple is charging a truckload for those upgrades 400 extra to get 32gb ram instead of 16... seriously? Dell charges 147 for this. Edit Totally worth it over the 13. You should get way better performance out of the 15 especially with the dedicated gpu.,0.024,0.852,0.124,0.9676,1
gmmuth,Dell,In my case I can't decide between the XPS 15 and waiting for the XPS 17... but since there are no actual reviews yet I'll wait. Especially now that I've seen how long the wait is. Why not go for the FHD version? That would save you 400 Euros pre-discount without losing out on performance and gaining some battery life as well. Can someone weigh in on how much you actually get out of a 4k screen for a 15 inch laptop? All my laptops have been 1080p so far so I'm also considering whether I should get a 4k or 1080p one.,0.026,0.849,0.126,0.8998,1

gmmuzi,Dell,Lenovo Yoga C940 is probably your pick for Windows then literally the best speakers on a Windows laptop and I'd say solid competition for the MBP 16 no top click on the trackpad but that's because newer Macbooks don't have a physical click - it's pressure sensitive with a little haptic feedback buzzer under it - still a solid trackpad though no coil whine good fan performance and several power settings performance with lots of fans intelligent cooling that will auto balance and power saver with lower clocks fans and longer battery life keyboard that according to my Macbook-user SO is a bit different than but as good as the old Magic Keyboard. up there with Thinkpads a bit less travel sharper actuation and a bit clickier not like a nasty click just nice mechanical noises all aluminum with Macbook-level build quality 16 9 but it's a 14 so you're just getting more horizontal space than a 13 MBP Literally just like 3/4 longer than a MBP 13 Also a convertible with the pen built-in and it's a decent size to use as a large tablet for handwriting and sketching. Good battery life with the UHD display if that's your thing I get about 7-8 hours with the latest BIOS and driver updates on mine even better with the FHD display reports sit around 10 hours average up to 12ish if you're not pushing it . If the speakers are your big thing I do audio recording and I'd be pretty happy mixing anything on my C940 with no monitors or headphones.

gmgits,Dell,Sounds like they didn't apply thermal paste correctly at the factory. That's not normal for your laptop. Maybe there's a dust buildup too? But you've had it for less than a year so I doubt that. I recommend repasting your laptop - there are plenty of tutorials around for doing that since it's very common for the XPS 15.

If all tests come out good I would say contact dell and see if you can get them to agree that maybe thermal paste is not on there/ something is broken.

gmcdws,Dell,Limit your framerate to something sensible in CS. This stops your GPU working too hard. In console type fps max 60. From memory you have to do it on every start up but maybe that has changed. I guess you can also do this via the nvidia control panel these days. Also get Throttlestop and create a profile for gaming with Turbo boost set to off. You'll get a lower peak clock speed but will produce much less heat.

Once the chkdsk finished you need to open up cmd with administrator right and type in sfc /scannow this will take a couple of minutes but this will ensure that no drivesys file has been corrupted To update the drivers open the Run dialog Win R type in devmgmt.msc open the drivers section right click the graphic drivers click update drivers and follow the update instructions.

gmay4a,Dell,Sounds like a dead PSU or mainboard to me. The black button on the PSU is actually a PSU tester. If the mainboard itself works and you press that button you are providing power to the mainboard. The system itself won't power on fully but can be used to see whether 5V rails and devices attached are functioning. At least with the T5500 it early brother they were notorious for their bad PSU's.

gmbsz9,Dell,I had random freeze ups and occasionally blue screens on mine for ages. Wound up being related to the SSD. Replaced it recently and feels like a new machine. What state is your battery in? Could it be working overtime to charge it non stop? My 9560 is 3.5 years old and the battery is starting to die. It's charge capacity is about half of what it's rated to and its very unreliable when charge level drops below 30%. It's spent most of its like on AC power which likely hasn't done it any favours. There are dozens of other things you can do to keep the temps down including undervolting cpu igpu dgpu repasting tinkering with boost settings etc in Throttlestop. In my experience you have to dial it all in if you want to do any gaming. Probably also worth dumping the OS and installing again. There were some particularly problematic builds of windows in late 2018/early 2019. The way updates are layered on top of one another seems to cause issues on a lot of machines.,0.06,0.851,0.089,0.3542,1
gmbsz9,Dell,Cooling issues are never fun on computers and being in a laptop just makes it harder. Have you run the bios diagnostics to be sure everything is working as it should. This will also show your battery health with other specs. But if everything is working correctly then there is a few issues that can be left. Biggest will be thermal paste between the heat sink and the cpgpu also could be the heat sinks/heat pipes being broken could also be the issue. With the whole sleep issue with lid close that should work so an wipe/ reload can help as windows rot is real. Before you can try to run some commands to recover windows with scannow/sfc .

gmbnyc,Dell,1. Only GPU through a program like MSI Afterburner 2. I'm not an expert in this department but I would assume because the Dell laptops have NVIDIA Optimus the GPU doesn't render the screen 3. I'm not an expert in this I do remember seeing a Dave Lee video for some G7 model saying you could I forget which and it would depend on the panel you have 4. That's up to you if you're going for a spinning HDD don't settle for under 1TB. An SSD will be much faster but also more expensive. Pretty sure this model can run an m.2 and 2.5 drive at the same time which it seems you did note with 6 5. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut 6. Anything under 512GB is too tight for me even with an extra HDD.

gmbbch,Dell,Sounds like your battery is worn out. Seems like it is six years old at this point. Which is about what I would expect from a battery from daily use. It needs to be replaced. You can use it without the battery but as you have noticed it will completely lose power if it gets unplugged so be careful about that. A new one from Dell costs 125 !

glz2mh,Dell,I just set up an i7 1080p 7590 for my kid. My personal opinion is that they are overall great laptops that can use some tweaking due to the thermal design limits a common issue with thin and light laptops that include cpu and gpu chips that get hot and throttle when pushed. The biggest fix is to undervolt the cpu. With the latest bios undervolting may be blocked which forces you to roll back to an older bios. See my comments in this thread . While the discussion is about a 9560 it mostly still applies but the cpu repasting may not be worth doing since dell improved that somewhat.,0.031,0.91,0.059,0.6311,1
glz2mh,Dell,Well there is one general issue the laptop is not capable to keep the CPU temperatures within operational levels during full load so it throttles by lowering performance. You won’t use full load that often so it’s somewhat acceptable. The sleep mode does not simply work reliable and some users including me experience WiFi issues.

Of the 15 in 35xx line only goes up to 32 gb ram 5540 goes up to 64 gb ram 7540 goes up to 128 gb ram The big differences between these two are portability sustained performance and upgrades The 5540 is smaller and lighter but that means that although it can pack similar components as 7540 it overheats much more quickly and will severely throttle the performance in sustained hours processing. Because the 7540 is bigger and has a better cooling setup the maxed configurations do have more powerful silicon inside. A few more notes •The new line of xps is announced and all that there is a new line of precisions in the works but not out yet. •You mentioned tight budget - either look at refurbished Dell has superb quality control for refurbished products or look into price matching the system you want look up other computers with the same specs you want to find one that you can price match . •If you're doing lots of heavy computing if it's sustained over a long time or gpu-heavy then I'd suggest the 7540.

Some things that helped me repaste cpu and gpu shaved near 20 degrees off peak load temps no joke undervolting cpu and igpu maybe another 5 degrees or so turn off turbo boost when gaming caps clocks at 2.80ghz but produces much less heat in a much more controlled manner undervolting dgpu now able to hold a constant 70 degrees with consistent 1800mhz dgpu clock speeds Set ultra performance under thermal settings in dell power manager allows the fans to run a bit harder Literally pointing a desk fan at the laptop if I really want to push it.

glj4c8,Dell,Hello for information which computer? x200B Never keep the standard battery charge parameters in the BIOS modify them to avoid a too deep discharge and a too high load. The worst is when you are on the mains and the parameters ins BIOS or Setup require that you always charge the battery. My parameters in the BIOS or the Setup because I am under Linux are to never charge more than 85% and to charge the battery only from 50% of SOC on mains see also the parameter critical charge action in Windows or Linux and set this parameter to 15 or 20% of remaining SOC State of Charge in order to avoid producing lithium dendrites which will irreparably destroy the battery slowly very slowly but definitively. From time to time every 4-6 months change the parameters to obtain a full charge at 90-95% never 100% and discharge the battery up to the threshold of 15-20% SOC depending on settings to calibrate the inevitable wear of the Li-Ion battery in the battery manager. Avoid to use Rapid Charge too often. OK we will have a battery that will have a range of use of only 20% to 85% on battery but it will last longer except construction defect . My parameters mean that on the mains as long as the battery is not below 85% it never charges even I plug in the main AC the LED charge indicator turns on but stops and if it does charge it charges but stops at 85% max. I install lithium battery systems LFP or LiFePO4 technology and charge systems solar panels alternators and shore for sailing boats I know the problem well even LFP are more safe. For ThinkPad Lenovo and I believe HP the charge is optimized in this way which means that the batteries wear out much less quickly but the computer seems not to be able to last longer on battery since the range of use is less important. Dell and many other computers do not have this battery charge control software and hardware. Sorry for my english I'm French.,0.062,0.88,0.058,0.4925,1

glxfpn,Dell,Unfortunately the XPS 15 bragging-right specs listed at Dell sales pages don't include the cooling capacity which is unfortunately a poor match to the heat dissipation of the listed chips when put to a serious long-tem workload. Certain hardware in the form of heatpipes and cooling fins is lacking. The XPS 15 is a thin-and-light and throttling is essential to keep it from meltdown. As you notice there are guides how to make it cope with gaming loads better. Repasting may be needed if you find the CPU and/or GPU temperatures higher than normal see Notebookcheck review for references . Padding the mosfet VRMs is highly recomended because they tend to run too hot. The main thing is to make the laptop produce less heat while still running reasonably. Undervolting tends to help substantially. For gaming it is mostly advisable to restrict CPU performance disable turbo or restrict package power or lock max multiplier so that the GPU is more likely to run unrestricted.,0.083,0.872,0.044,-0.6908,-1

glws71,Dell,I'd only recommend upgrading the SSD and ram if this is the machine you're sticking with for the next 1-2years and money isn't an issue. Both will improve the quality of life for you in little ways but they won't improve performance if you laptops is already struggling with modern games. You said you can run ac 1 to unity so I can take away from that origins and odyssey can't or doesn't run well. Star citizen is a huge CPU hog but an SSD and 16gbs of ram would make it a little smoother I upgraded to 32gbs and it still used 21gbs at times. And a decent sized ssd that is compatible with your g7 model with enough space for multiple modern sized games is going to set you back a bit of money. None of these are going to increase your performance in a large way if you're already struggling. If you already have one of the current gen consoles just stick with that till next gen is out then sell it and use that and any money you were thinking about using for laptop upgrades to buy an ps5 or xbox series X,0.047,0.886,0.066,0.427,1

glofhg,Dell,I have been using my XPS 13 9300 for almost 2 weeks now and the complaints are always over-dramatic. There are no issues that I have noticed aside from some random stuff that almost every laptop has. If you want really in-depth overview of things that someone might find annoying here is a list The laptop will get pretty loud doing anything graphics intensive but there is no whining sound it just sounds like smaller fans spinning really fast. It will get fairly hot if your running anything graphics intensive after around 20 minutes. But remember this laptop is super thin and very light so it is to be expected. If you are planning to game on this frequently though I would not get any kind of ultrabook. If your not planning on running graphics too much then this laptop remains pretty cool and dell has optimized this laptop to have excellent battery life. I can go about 8-10 hours without needing to charge. Random Wi-Fi disconnects maybe once a day Screen Flashes something to do with auto-refresh I believe this is not a bad thing but it bothers some people Average quality speakers but definitely not bad they work just fine for most normal media consumption Software stuff implemented by Dell that I believe is related to battery life. Dell Power Manager that's installed seems to change speeds a little but you can tell this laptops power is being throttled a bit for sake of battery life. You can install a fresh version of Windows that may fix this but I didn't and don't think it's necessary Other than that stuff this laptop while a bit pricey is definitely gorgeously designed and is pretty much exactly what I thought it was going to be. It is probably the smallest 13 ultrabook but the nice 16 10 aspect ratio and borderless display make this laptop feel around a 14in while being crazy light and portable.,0.044,0.789,0.168,0.9938,1
glofhg,Dell,if you search this forum and also DellXPS you will notice 2 issues that many people are complaining about first major 2nd minor TB3 not working properly especially when trying to connect external monitor under Ubuntu screen goes blank for a 1-2s on some events Furthermore several people pointed that the following components are working but could be better quality webcam speakers Finally as all XPS 13 laptops and macbooks and probably many others to that matter it can't operate at maximum CPU frequency for more than few minutes which makes the name XPS eXtreme Performance System sound a bit like a grotesque... . After that it will throttle down CPU to stay cool. This is an obvious misdesign of the cooling system Lenvovo Thinkpads can operate for days on full throttle without even getting close to get hot but they have laughably little amount of RAM OTOH I'm considering purchasing this laptop also but I will definitely wait for the TB3 issue to be resolved specifically I'm waiting for Plugable to announce 9300 to be compatible with their TBT3-UDV dock Other than this it really depends what are you going to use this laptop for but comparing to other brands it has IMO outstanding quality specs /price ratio in 13 category it is the only 13 laptop with reasonably small display bezel reasonable amount of RAM although 64GB would be better TB3 support when they fix it duh... official Linux support and reasonable international warranty support I currently own 9360 model and often move between various South-East Asian countries and so far always managed to get Dell engineer to come fix whatever problems I had just waiting for parts to arrive was taking long ,0.016,0.855,0.129,0.9879,1

glv0yi,Dell,I think a better comparison would be between the XPS and the X1 Extreme Gen2. While similar the Extreme is for power-hungry users whereas the P1 is for professionals as its hardware e.g. graphics card is not geared towards gaming but rather is optimised to work with software like AutoCAD and Solidworks. If you care about the screen the OLED of the Extreme is significantly brighter than the P1. You can look more into them if you care. Now as far as the XPS with the i9 goes... You'd be avoiding all heating bills in the winter but you would be giving up your laptop. Seeing the thermal issues of the XPS lineup I would not trust it with the i9 even with undervolting and repasting. I've heard similar thermal issues on Lenovo's side though so make sure to do some digging in each subreddit to see if there are many thermal issues with your chose processor .

However keep in mind that the size of objects in a native 1080p Windows environment is perfectly rendered with a 100% scale factor and the matte treatment makes everything smooth for daily use.

gluizl,Dell,I haven't paired to an external display but there's enough knobs to turn that you should be able to get the volume to a reasonable place. Repasted with Arctic MX-4. I'm not brave enough to do liquid metal. You'll eventually thermally throttle but it shouldn't be at 56C. You'll want to undervolt. You can try reloading the defaults in the BIOS but that didn't work for me. Most are downgrading to 1.8.0 but you can use the information in to find the CFG Lock offset and re-enable undervolting on the latest BIOS. CFG Lock is offset 0x5C3 to save you some work. Once you have undervolting enabled click the TPL button in ThrottleStop and uncheck Clamp then go into FIVR and check Disable and Lock Turbo Power Limits. This will keep the system from lowering PL1 on you. Mine would limit the CPU down to 16W before I did that.,0.04,0.923,0.037,-0.1063,-1

glpfaz,Dell,I'd go with a Lenovo Yoga C940 - they're offered in 15 and 14 models use AES 2.0 digitizers generally preferred over the MPP digitizers in the Spectre line and have much more modern specs than the XPS 15 2-in-1 which also isn't set to get an update anytime soon . My C940 14 does really well in Sketchbook and Krita and if you find the built-in pen a bit small it's roughly pencil-sized if you're more used to that then there's a lot of other options for it check out stylus under the AES 2.0 heading in the wiki to see what will work . The 14 has one of the new Ice Lake chips which will be great for lighter gaming Minecraft older AAA stuff or indies maybe not ARMA 3 and even my UHD model gets me around 8 hours of battery life pretty easily. The 15 has a more powerful processor and dedicated graphics so it'll be better at gaming but the battery is the same size for more power-hungry component so if longer battery life is your priority the 14 might be a better pick. Both the 14 and 15 models have Thunderbolt 3 ports though so you could go for the 14 and add an external GPU later if you need the extra horsepower. As far as how they compare to a Wacom tab generally they'll have a bit more wobble on diagonal lines especially slow ones a higher initial activation force though it's still pretty good compared to MPP and in general feel a bit less like working on paper or canvas - you kinda have to learn the system and its issues and work with it as opposed to just doing what you want and it coming out with no issues. It's a pretty great compromise compared to having a laptop or desktop and a separate tablet though because you can take it with you anywhere - I had some work for classes that required a visit to the Met so I took all my notes some sketches and a quick map by hand on my laptop.,0.008,0.868,0.124,0.9908,1

I will end up going for the Macbook even though I prefer windows as overall the Macbook is the superior machine for me as it has 100wh battery software that allows you to control the fans and very solid resale value in the future unlike the Dell which will depreciate significantly after one year after which you can purchase it for a very good price.,0.0,0.9,0.1,0.882,1

glh92c,Dell,You probably know that fan speed is controlled by temperature. So do all fans rotate as they should?

glh92c,Dell,I have the 9380 bought it last year as a contractor to do development in a quiet office. I have never been so disappointed in a product. The XPS line universally has people complain about the fan noise all the while Dell claims space age cooling design in their marketing material. Dell lock people out of fan control and force people to use a horrible piece of Dell bloatware to control their fans. I have mine set to quiet right now and it's producing more noise at idle than other laptops I've owned have at full load. This is while the temps are only at 55 C even! Edit this was also at better performance instead of best performance. 2GHz instead of 4... Performing basic tasks such browsing the web/email pushes the CPU temp to 99 C. Simply try to play a Youtube video and it gets even worse. I'm stuck with this machine and so I've been thinking about opening it up and repasting it etc. But I will never buy a Dell machine again. This is a universal issue with the XPS line there is no solution to it regardless of what their braindead support people say. They need to completely redesign their cooling solution and they need to let people customise/control it.

glecri,Dell,Likely samsung wouldnt play ball and make them a custom panel or it was too expensive too. Maybe it was an engineering issue as they'd likely have a custom production line just for this panel and wasn't worth the effort or the yields weren't right. Oled in screens bigger than a smartphone has provem to have alot of issues with scaling. I think we will see a return of oled in some shape or form but given apple is looking at micro led backlit panels that offer oled like black levels and much higher brightness levels its possible dell will go this route. Oled on a laptop just has too many burn in issues cost and longevity. I feel its a bit of a dead end display technology as much as I like it.,0.064,0.863,0.072,0.273,1
glecri,Dell,Yeah I also wanted an OLED version. Haven't seen OLED on a laptop personally but have seen it on Samsung smartphones and heard about it on YT reviews. As others have mentioned in other threads no manufacturer currently manufactures 16 10 OLEDs.,0.066,0.896,0.038,-0.296,-1
glecri,Dell,There isn't a 16 10 OLED panel yet. x200B I own the XPS 15 7590 4K OLED and it's really such a beautiful screen. I often watch 4K movies on it you do not want anything else anymore.,0.033,0.856,0.112,0.6068,1
glecri,Dell,Here's my take. I got the 7590 with OLED last week a day before the release of the 9500. Knowing that OLED isn't available yet? in 16 10 has made that pill a whole lot easier to swallow. Now that I've seen what OLED offers going to UHD even if 16 10 is simply not enticing especially at the price of the upgrade . I got my 7590 for 1 030 CAD less than the 9500 see relevant specs below . Right now the dividends of an upgrade are simply not there for me. Maybe in a couple of years when the 17 XPS becomes more affordable and they iron out what I can only assume will be kinks in this new machine that prospect will be much more enticing?

glklh3,Dell,Not worth it... Get 1080p will do just fine. I think you will get better 4k experience on TV or monitor on desktop due to battery life and HDR and setting whatnot. Other than watch movie in 4k you doesn't really use the 4k for anything else. The image is more vivid but not worth it on laptop. Not all software made for scaling and you will definitely see the flaw easily namely winRar or settings in Control Panel. UWP software will scales nicely because of the architecture. Unless you are photographer you need to see your picture in the exact scale for panning and zoom then you need to get this 4k resolution.,0.027,0.861,0.112,0.889,1
glklh3,Dell,1080p will be a lot more problem-free but 4K isn't a huge issue anymore.

I dont mind 5/6hrs on the battery since I mainly work from offices where I can plug in but the visual side the window real estate size the crispness of icons fonts sharpness - all totally worth it speaking from xps 9560 perspective with 4k display . Of course all that said I am running 150% dpi settings.

glk2y9,Dell,Hi I had the 16gb 1tb oled i7 model and sold it a few days ago. I really regretted buying it because of several reasons. It had coilwhine which really annoyed me. The thermals were just awful even after repasting. The fans were almost always audible and when doing heavier duty work really loud. The case also got very hot. Battery life was subpar The oled had screen banding Now to be fair I think most laptops with that generation of Intel laptops have problems with keeping the CPU cool. But if I spend so much money for a laptop I just can't live with so many problems. I'm also a programmer and personally I'm going to get the new x13 with a ryzen cpu when it comes out. It may take a while though because those puppies are gonna sell really good. But since I have a x260 lying around I can wait Hope I could help!,0.109,0.81,0.082,-0.6689,-1
glk2y9,Dell,You should get i7 with possible lowest RAM and possible lowest SSD storage. So you can slowly learn to upgrade these hardware yourself. They don't teach you this in computer science. ComSci is for you to learn how software works on certain hardware like machine code to x86 or ARM. It is more on explaining why a computer is working and how it begin. Taking this course will allowed you to get broad knowledge about data science electrical signal architecture design software engineering and mathematics.,0.058,0.891,0.051,-0.1531,-1

gle0pq,Dell,Have you done a diagnostics check by pressing F12 at boot? There should be a seperate test for the integrated webcam. If it doesn't show up in there it is most likely a hardware fault. I've had a similar issue before with a customer's laptop.,0.071,0.929,0.0,-0.4522,-1
gljgez,Dell,Dell's been pretty clear that the last 15 2-in-1 was a flop and they're not revisiting it for a while. There's a leaked XPS roadmap that predicted the 9500 and 9700 but had no mention of a new 15 2-in-1 so I wouldn't expect one until at least 2021.,0.125,0.795,0.08,-0.3071,-1
gljgez,Dell,I think anything larger than the 13” in 2 in 1 format is not as practical. Machine becomes heavier and larger to handle as a tablet. Will it work? I think it could if you’re willing to deal with this. A lot of things go into play though as far as dell offering the new 15 in a 2-1 format but demand is the greatest contributor to its return.,0.026,0.864,0.11,0.775,1

glhh6h,Dell,The audio crackling seems to be a perpetual problem with Dell. It's the result of a number of design decisions. These include - the Killer chipset dodgy video drivers poor power management and poor thermals. Undercooling helps turning off turbo boot helps running on mains power helps changing the audio drivers helps but... all the fixes published only address one of the contributing factors so things get better but not perfect. To be fair it's difficult to replicate because it depends on network activity graphics activity ambient temperature charging/battery status and how good the thermal pasting is but despite promises Dell haven't really tried that hard either or I'm sure they would have fixed it. Maybe there is a cost implication or the problem needs to affect more people? I finally gave up because audio is really important to me sent my new XPS 15 back and bought a MacBook Pro. I still use my 3 year old Latitude for writing email browsing CAD and because I like Windows - but use the Mac for anything that needs real-time low latency performance.

gldh22,Dell,I'm having the same problem undervolting on my G7 7790 17 . Which is a pain since the i7 9750 is actually as hotter than the surface of the sun. The settings never apply through throttlestop and the undervolting settings in intel extreme tuning thingy are greyed out.

glf9kr,Dell,The anti reflective coating on the macbook is the best out of any glossy display in the industry but its not as good as a matte display. Why are you looking at the xps 15? Shouldn't you be looking at the 13 inch? If your just coding I think the xps wins.,0.081,0.783,0.136,0.6429,1
glf9kr,Dell,Which model of the XPS 15 are you looking at? I would avoid the base i5 model at all costs. It seems to literally be an XPS 13 inside the body of an XPS 15. It has a smaller battery and integrated graphics. Battery life will be much better on a matte XPS 13 than the base XPS 15 and the 13 is cheaper too. The fact that you are looking at the 13 Pro indicates to me that you probably don't need dedicated graphics. In that case why not just look at the XPS 13? The 13 is an amazing machine in its own right.,0.042,0.894,0.064,0.5236,1
glf9kr,Dell,If i had more money i'd get the uhd display config Msi Prestige 15. I use it for coding so i get to read text all day. The 1080p screen is not bad at all but for coding a higher res display is greatly appreciated since sometimes i can differentiate pixels around letters very easily while starring at the display from around 60cm. If you haven't used matte screens before you have no idea how helpful they are in removing almost all the glare way better than the anti reflective glossy screens on any macbook or other laptops. Afaik the new matte screens don't interfere with display's color accuracy sharpness color gamut contrast brightness so that's good. If you can afford it i'd highly suggest you the uhd config Xps 15 9500 also get a matte screen protector for it search somehwere on ebay amazon or aliexpress. If they aren't out yet they will be in the upcoming weeks. Usually they're very thin 1mm or thinner so tjey won't touch the keyboard when you close the laptop's lid. I'd highly suggest you get this combo uhd and matte screen protector . The Macbook pro 13 is weaker and smaller not in the same category but its screen is still noticeably reflective even though it has an antireflective coating. Even if you decide to get the mbp 13 i'd still recommend you get a matte screen protector for it.,0.037,0.843,0.119,0.9693,1

gl2l7y,Dell,It's not a gimmick. I'm a grad student and I use the current 7390 2-in-1 for note taking when I'm in class. The handwriting recognition is very good and the sensitivity of the pen allows you to write in very small spaces legibly. I have the version with a 4k screen and I get around 6 hours of battery life. As far as other benefit tent mode comes in handy when I'm playing games. Also when I'm eating lunch and reading I like to flip it so that the keyboard is flat against the table and the screen is angled towards me. This way I don't need to worry about crumbs falling into the keyboard ,0.014,0.873,0.113,0.8833,1
gl2l7y,Dell,I use my C940 in the foldy modes about as much as I use it as a regular laptop. Handwriting notes is great in tablet mode especially if you're working with a lot of diagrams or want to have a more accurate representation of what your professors are putting on the board if they're write-on-the-board kind of people . I use it in the stand mode when I'm in bed to have some youtube playing on the side too which is nice don't really use the tent thing too much but it's there if you have limited space . As far as battery life the 9500 has a bigger battery but also has higher-powered components so it's bigger partly to compensate for that. If you're going with the 13 I'd say definitely skip the UHD screen because it's very much not worth the hit to your battery - my C940 is 14 and I could barely notice the difference vs. the FHD one the only reason I went for UHD was because that's what was available with the specs I wanted. I'm not too mad because I still get like 8ish hours of battery life pretty easily with the latest bios and driver updates but realistically with the FHD display I'd be hitting 10 hours regularly. I will say that if you're not set on an XPS you can get 15 2-in-1s the HP Spectre x360 just got a refresh that looks really sweet and it's designed from the ground up with a UHD screen so it has a 97Wh battery or a 14 like the Lenovo Yoga C940 that I have - built as well as a Macbook IMO great screen the best audio on a Windows laptop solid keyboard pen built in and good battery life even with a UHD screen if you're set on that . You'll get a bit of extra real estate if you're worried that a 13 will be too small coming from your Macbook but I'll just say that 14 is about as big a 2-in-1 as I'd be comfortable using - they get heavy they get big and it's just kind of a clunky experience to use them as a tablet.,0.02,0.832,0.148,0.994,1

Someone mentioned their battery degraded after a short time. Of course for me after 4 years I can't really use it without a cable but it only began after 1 5 or 2 years. I might replace the battery to get over this issue but I'm planning to change my laptop. Mine is an older model so the webcam is at the bottom of the screen and this has been the biggest problem for me. When I'm on a call my hands are practically blocking the webcam while I'm typing. But they finally put the camera where it belongs so it is not a problem.

They are currently doing a second opinion. Also I got to have my screen replaced because of noticable bleeding and it has some coil whine. I know others don't have these issues but it shows you quality control is pretty poor.

gkvq18,Dell,Sounds like a botched explanation. Nvidia G-Sync is the name of the dynamic refresh rate feature. Nvidia PhysX is the physics acceleration feature for video games. Nvidia Optimus is the feature that switches between internal graphics card the Intel GPU and the external graphics card the Nvidia GPU . They are trying to say that G-Sync is dynamically setting the refresh rate. The part about PhysX is wrong. I have a Dell G5 5590 with a 144hz display. It does not have dynamic refresh rate G-Sync . I don't know if there are possible configs with G-Sync. My display always runs at 144hz.,0.03,0.872,0.098,0.7269,1
gkvq18,Dell,Are you sure your G5 5590 has a 144Hz display? There are models where the screen is only 60Hz e.g. the one with the i5-9300H on Dell's site . Yes the explanation makes no sense. ChadValijean is right in that Nvidia PhysX has nothing to do with framerate but I also want to add that G-Sync or FreesSync does not limit your display's refresh rate in any way. It dynamically syncs your monitor's refresh rate with a game's FPS to eliminate screen tearing. But when you're on your desktop or doing any other sort of tasks your screen should be running at 144Hz. Optimus technology also shouldn't have any impact on your display's refresh rate. That offloads work to your iGPU if your discrete GPU is not needed so your laptop can extend its battery life. Both GPUs should support 144Hz. Edit Have you gone into your Nvidia Control Panel to check the refresh rate there?,0.01,0.902,0.088,0.89,1
gkvq18,Dell,Are you trying to set the refresh rate for the built-in intel gpu which might not support 144hz? You might have to check and set any nvidia-specific display parameters from an nvidia app not the windows control panel or from the app/game you're trying to use.,0.048,0.952,0.0,-0.3089,-1

Honestly I'm waiting to buy my 9500 on other threads in this sub a lot of redditors talk about dell support suggesting about the release the 8-core in the next weeks. It's nosense to sell this processor only in US when all the XPS where shipped from the same place in China directly to you.

gkpyl0,Dell,i7-10875H is an 8-core processor already with hyperthreading so 16 threads . It seems to replace the i9-9980H from the previous gen 7590. I'm interested about the thermals since the 9500 doesn't have the vapor chamber like the 9700 will. The single-core performance will probably be faster on the 6-core 10750H though so if you don't regularly need 8 cores I would get the 6-core model.

gkurx7,Dell,Hi! Thanks for reaching out to us. I’m Deepti from the Dell Social Media team. I understand that you're facing an issue with the heating. Please be assured that I will look into this and help you with the best available options to have this resolved for you at the earliest. Before we proceed I have a couple of questions to understand the issue better 1. How long have you been facing the issue? 2. Have you made any recent hardware/software changes to the system? 3. Did you notice any Windows update that took place recently? Follow any of the below videos and disable the Turbo Boost. Disable Turbo Boost within BIOS Disable Turbo Boost within Windows If the system still heats after the above steps then I’d request you to run a basic hardware test. This test to check if all the hardware components in the system are working well. Here’s a video on how to run this test. Let us know the results of this hardware test and service tag via private message. You could even share a picture of the result screen. -Deepti,0.0,0.828,0.172,0.984,1
gknwnx,Dell,I use an Akitio Node and a GTX 1080 connected to a TB16. Originally I had external monitors connected to the eGPU but my dock would keep dropping USB connections possibly a bandwidth limit? . I haven't done concrete benchmarks but the GTX 1080 does boost my games. It also turns off the built-in NVIDIA GPU and allows the CPU to run at MUCH lower temps 60-70 versus 80-90 deg C . And not connecting the monitors to the eGPU means that the GTX 1080 can also be turned off when not gaming.,0.032,0.928,0.04,0.1901,1

gkmmzg,Dell,Yeah looks like your CPU is being thermal throttled hard. SMH 800mhz on the CPU. Unplugging the battery won't do much because the cooling design and Dell's thermal management are inherently flawed. The biggest culprit seems to be the uncooled Mosfet VRMs on top of both the CPU and GPU. It's a well known issue among the XPS 15 lines that none of the paid reviews out there address about it. Undervolting won't help much throttling will eventually occur under sustained load. Disabling turbo boost is not a proper solution that's like throwing your money out of the window. Dell finally addresses this in the new XPS 15 2020 by actually covering the Mosfet VRMs under the heat sink. Though only through stress test that we can tell. I would say once thermal review for the new XPS 15/17 comes out you should ditch this piece of junk that is the XPS 15 9560.

gkktad,Dell,The other people mentioned very good points. For day to day use 15 is much more usable over 13 . However.. you mentioned you had a egpu and a monitor. 1. Personally I chose the 13 because I have a 24 monitor desktop and the 13 is much nicer for portability. If I didn't have the monitodesktop I would've chosen the 15 for much better day to day use. It'll definitely depend on your personal use case. If you mainly use the system at home w/ the monitor definitely the 13 . If you use it fairly mobile the 15 . 2. It'll depend on which cpu on the 13 and the 15 you're comparing. However compare it with the cpu that you currently have. Even if you go with the 13 it'll still be an improvement. If that's enough for you I'd go for 13 . If you found you're current cpu lacking then consider the 15 .,0.0,0.89,0.11,0.9468,1

gkk5lg,Dell,I think that people can be a little dramatic when it comes to the xps laptops.

gkk5lg,Dell,I don't think there is an easy answer to it. Expectations Price one pay and experience decides the answer mostly. I bought the first touch XPS 13 6-7 years back and I still use it till I got precision 5540 through work I know it's an XPS 7590 with different name and nvidia card. XPS 13 touch works well intel 7290 gave away and had to replace it fan replaced... Thermal paste replaced twice. I always believe in taking care of issues immediately instead of pushing it till one gets frustrated and hence I don't have much issues. I also keep internals of the laptop clean. When shit hits the fan you can always send an email to an executive and get these things taken care off! Unless you are unreasonable ofcourse.

A few things like the speakers trackpad are also not as good as the ones on a macbook 16 inch.

gkeaog,Dell,I'm in similar situation as you are right now as I believe my motherboard died on my XPS 15 9570 i7 as well as there are no signs of power anywhere on the laptop. The issue I have is likely a short somewhere on the board as I replaced the cmos battery which did not do anything. I thought about purchasing a new motherboard as new ones on eBay cost only about 550 and replacing my shorted motherboard but I decided otherwise because I plan to purchase an i9 16inch Macbook for around 2 200 on eBay after I either scrap my 9570 for parts or try to get the motherboard repaired at a specialist shop. Currently my Inspiron 1545 with an ssd upgrade is serving me well.,0.032,0.933,0.035,0.0772,1

gkheak,Dell,If you've had it for a year or more you may want to try to re-paste the CPU. I recently did that on my Dell Latitude 7390 2-in-1. It had idle temp in the 70's and frequently gets throttled due to heat. I repasted the CPU with Artic Silver 5 and now it idles in the upper 40 to lower 50 and reaches high 80's low 90's under load and almost never throttles anymore.

gkr9yc,Dell,Hi! Thank you for reaching the Dell Reddit Support. I understand that you're facing an issue with the speakers and LCD. Please be assured that I will look into this and help you with the best available options to have this resolved for you at the earliest. Before we proceed I have a couple of questions to understand the issue better 1. How long have you been facing the issue? 2. Have you made any recent hardware/software changes to the system? 3. Can you share a video of the issue? Let’s run the hardware diagnostics to understand if there is any hardware failure in the system. To do so 1 Restart the system. 2 Keep tapping F12 key when the Dell logo appears during the startup. 3 Select diagnostics from the one-time boot menu and run the initial test. 4 Once done do let me know if you receive any error code and validation code. You can skip the extended memory test. You can also refer to the link Share the results and service tag via private message. -Deepti,0.031,0.819,0.15,0.9623,1

gkk80w,Dell,Hey guys. Purchased my xps a bit less than a month ago. Recently noticed this finger print line on the touch pad. Im very cautious about using laptops and not using greasy fingers while working on it and considering covid - hands are washed regularly. Can see this line under an angle with light tried using the fiber cloth to gently wipe it a bit but it doesnt look like this line is even a “dirt” on the outside surface. I tried wiping it with a slightly wet cloth - and you can see how the wet spot on the outside just shapes around the “greasy line shape”.

BUT they will also always give a satisfactory service in the end with their in site repair as well as sending parts when needed. Also Dell offers One Business Days Repairs. I dont think HP does that.

gjyis8,Dell,They're not shady so much as understaffed due to what I'm assuming is significant call increases from COVID purchases and outsourced either pre-COVID as a matter of cost savings or more recently as a method of trying to keep up with the call volume . That results in a large number of reps being unqualified script-readers which also makes the calls take longer as well as introduces more scrutiny than normal on metrics. Management knows they're underwater and any CSR who is below par will get replaced quickly to try and bring things up overall. Dropped calls lost sales It's no different than shopping at a local department store and being asked 17 times if you want to sign up for a store credit card so you can save 15% today. They get a small bonus for every signup or sometimes for passing a threshold and get fired if they don't hit particular numbers. I don't consider the checkout person to be shady nor really the company as most are upfront with the employees about what will happen to them if they miss the numbers though I do find it distasteful. EDIT On the new order number thing there are two possibilities there. First the rep did it to get their name attached for metrics. As long as there's no cost increase or order delay to you this shouldn't really matter. Second if the order was canceled because your payment didn't go though it's entirely possible that the system considered it dead and forced a reorder.

Pro users who mostly don't even pay for the machines they praise - their companies do should learn their place in this forum. Dell consumer isn't what you're used to in your huge corporate or academic campuses. You don't get half the pampering even of you buy premium support . And PRE-SALES are especially stupid as any company these days especially Dell has low-to-no interest in spending CS-hours in a process they already spent millions on a direct-to-consumer webshop or that they outsource to B M.

Imagine Mercedes returning a broken car claiming that they repaired it and that you are now out of warranty - thats what happened to me with Dell. I think the main reason for this destructive development is that most of the venture capital that invest in US companies is located in flaky California where most people mainly care about surfing or smoking joints with movie stars.,0.097,0.846,0.057,-0.6232,-1

gkfdqe,Dell,I think your laptop is basically overheating and switching off is it's way of protecting itself. What i would do if i was you. A . Send the laptop back if it's still in warranty or let it be repaired by Dell. B . Open up the laptop repaste the thermal. Try undervolting the CPU a but usually -0.125mv or so use ThrottleStop if undervolting does not work try downgrading your BIOS to a earlier version. Also using ThrottleStop turn off Turbo Boost yes you will lose some performance but the CPU will run a lot cooler and draw less power. Edit Open up the laptop repaste the CPU with new thermal paste.,0.032,0.904,0.064,0.5499,1

gk9zu1,Dell,The ThrottleStop FIVR window has a monitoring table in the top right corner. Look in the Offset column. If your undervolt is working it will show in that column.

gk9zu1,Dell,It's still blocked probably. Install HWINFO and check the voltage offset. You can do factory reset on bios to get back undervolt. You should set turbo bootst power long and short max to 25 - 30 in order to give enough temperature room for GPU. There is no need to undervolt your GPU but if you'd like it to be quieter and less heat. Undervolt it to 0.7v and cap the frequency to 1500Mhz.

gk96mo,Dell,They're basically the same computer. The 2-in-1 was launched as the 7390 before Dell decided to change all their model numbers again.,0.0,0.933,0.067,0.128,1
gk96mo,Dell,The 2-in-1 has a soldered ssd. That's a big difference for me.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gk96mo,Dell,The 7390 2-in-1 came out at the end of September and was the first of the XPS lineup with the updated build 16 10 display with minimal bezels . They changed the naming convention with that model away from the 9XXX numbers to the 7XXX numbers because they claimed they wanted all of their premium laptops to start with the 7XXX numbers. Then when they launched the new XPS 13 9300 they decided to change the numbers back to the old naming convention. To answer your question here are the differences between the 2-in-1 and the 9300 7390 2-in-1 has soldered RAM and SSD presumably to make the device thinner 9300 only has soldered RAM SSD is replaceable They both use the same 10th-gen Ice Lake processors They both have 16 10 display ratios with identical displays including the touch They both have similar batteries and similar battery life the FHD models have significantly better battery life than the UHD displays The 7390 2-in-1 has the new vapor change cooling system that just looks like a plastic cover placed over the heatsinks The 9300 does not have the new cooling system but reviews says that the performance on it still better than the 7390 2-in-1 in some benchmarks although it does run hotter. One review said that the increased performance may be due to updated system settings on the 9300 since the specs were otherwise the same. I personally noticed that my 7390 2-in-1 was faster to boot and more responsive after the latest Intel UHD drivers and the most recent BIOS The 9300 has an updated keyboard with more key travel than the 7390 2-in-1 but they also got rid of the separate pg up and pg down keys instead making the left and right arrows larger and placing the pg up and pg down keys as function activated keys. They both have the same trackpad. Obvious but might as well point it out The 7390 2-in-1's keyboard can be folded back completely and be used as a tablet. The ports are identical on both models while the 9300 is slightly smaller almost imperceptibly thinner and weighs slightly less. Big difference 9300 has Windows Hello facial recognition support and a better webcam. The 7390 2-in-1 has no Windows Hello facial recognition and a potato web cam. They both have fingerprint readers. I think everything else is the same.,0.007,0.932,0.061,0.9656,1

gk3kec,Dell,We don't know yet how the base XPS 15 performs especially regarding screen as historically the FHD panels in the XPS 15s are all shitty or mediocre at best for all the iterations before. On the contrary the Surface Laptop 3 got a gorgeous panel which is also extremely bright. It's a wonderful but super expensive machine. But it's got very little rendering power especially compared to a way bigger XPS 15. Batterylife is most certainly quite similar as the 13 is smaller but got way higher quality panel and the higher resolution sucks more power. The SL3 is at around 9 hours the baseline i5 XPS 15 with the FHD panel might be around that figure as well - when we assume it will remain the way it always been a low-lit mediocre FHD panel. nbsp Yet the base models are usually just marketing methods to be able to design a pricing strategy around starting at to catch first touch points. Though again we don't know about this particular iteration as there are no reviews out yet. The Surface Laptop 3 13 is a very refined machine and the panel alone make it way more versatile for using it in multitude of places.

gk0xmj,Dell,When I experienced this back in 2015 I had to replace my RAM but that's not always the case. I'll just give you some generic things to look out for... Is the CPU running overly hot? Grab CoreTemp to see in excess of 100c the power will be cut so I think this is unlikely. Plus the laptop would practically burn you depending on how you use it... Is there any bloatware on the machine you can afford to cut? Eliminating potential causes is probably the only way to troubleshoot and it can be tedious. Booting into safe mode is an idea if you don't encounter the same problem then you can more confidently blame software since safe mode will only allow core services to start. Remove whatever software you think is sketchy and just rinse and repeat. If it's still buggered you'd generally want to remove some memory and see how it goes. Then your GPU and so on for each piece of hardware again just eliminating possible causes . Not so easy with a laptop.

gjw1kz,Dell,I've bought 2 refurbished XPS's through the Dell Outlet and both were in excellent condition 9.9/10 and no battery wear. My experience is that Dell does a good job inspecting their refurbished devices to make sure they are in like new condition.,0.045,0.72,0.235,0.8481,1
gjw1kz,Dell,It’s unfortunate that they raised the prices on the old model as soon as the new one came out. I ordered mine a week before base model graphics card and got it for 1180 using few coupon codes and the dell chat they give good discounts!!! . If you’re not up for the chat it should go down eventually but I’ve also heard good things about the dell outlet although I didn’t order from it because at the time they didn’t have the model I wanted Good luck!,0.021,0.823,0.156,0.9302,1
gjw1kz,Dell,So many people miss out complaining about refurbs when they are actually tested better than a new one. I find it hilarious when people say I paid good money for my laptop 11 months ago and they have the BALLS to offer a refurb! LOL... Most of the time they are returns with nothing wrong with them. I just got a scratch and dent refurb XPS 13 2-in-1 and there is literally just the tiniest scuff on one of the hinges that you really really have to try hard to see and I saved 400!,0.051,0.804,0.145,0.8853,1
gjtncx,Dell,I just got my XPS 13 Monday with the lowest CPU for better battery life i5 1035G1 . It says it runs at only 1ghz but that things flies all day long even on the lowest power setting constantly chilling at 1.3ghz and jumping to around 3ghz when opening stuff. It's quad core I don't think you'll have any issue with computing power and the vast majority of tasks.,0.09,0.882,0.028,-0.5267,-1
gjtncx,Dell,I just got the 7390 2-in-1 and it has the 16 10 and Ice Lake like the 9300 and it's worth it. Not sure where you are hearing slower there are maybe some certain benchmarks it's a few percent slower but 10x as many that trounce the older one especially once graphics are involved. They are both same generation processor but Comet Lake is on the older 14nm process it's more like the 9th gen they never launched while Ice Lake is on the new 10nm process and more efficient and double the graphics power.,0.03,0.85,0.12,0.8444,1
gjtncx,Dell,They improved alot of things to the newer model. The base model now has a much brighter 500 nit screen as standard. The old one hit 300 nits. The newer one has a 100% srgb display. Older one hit around 65%. The speakers have been improved. The track pad is much bigger. The processors are not slower. Ghz clock speed isn't the only way to measure perfomance. What also matter is instructions per clock or ipc which has improved alot on the newer models. Graphics even on the i5 has also seen a bit of a bump with the i7 having the biggest jump. The older models also have big issues with overheating yes they may be advertised as hitting 4ghz or more but in reality that's an up to speed they hit it for a few seconds but actual sustained performance is far far lower.,0.019,0.908,0.073,0.6187,1
gjtncx,Dell,The new CPU in the 9300 is... hmmm. In CPU performance it's slightly better than the 4 core CPUs in the older XPS models e.g i7-10510U . Long story short the frequency is lower but they can do more calculations in a single clock cycle Hz so it balances out. There are some use-case specific differences. For example the Ice Lake 10th gen G parts are better for vectorized workloads. But if you're dealing with intensive multithreaded workloads then the 6-core i7-10710U is usually better. For most people I would say... this isn't a big deal. But it is worth noting the G4 and G7 configurations have much better integrated GPU performance 50% so this is a big plus for the 9300 much better for any e.g light gaming . Anyway overall I would say the 9300 is a better machine. I don't think it's worth the extra money in an objective sense - the improvements are nice but they aren't essential or game changing in any way. If you go to Dell Factory Outlet and get an older XPS or a Latitude 7400 you can save hundreds of dollars and it'll do everything you'd need for many years to come. But subjectively speaking... if you want the 16 10 aspect ratio upgraded iGPU etc and you can comfortably afford the 9300... well yeah... You do you I guess.,0.007,0.82,0.173,0.9904,1

gjum7g,Dell,Yeah that's how Optimus system works. When you tab out to check the dGPU's usage on task manager the game stops rendering in the background so... there is not much works for the dGPU to do hence low usage. And when you're watching video it's considered to be light task so the system will automatically use your iGPU to do the decoding instead of using your dGPU. The frame rate drops you're describing is thermal throttling/power throttling and has nothing to do with GPU's usage. This is caused by the CPU/GPU/any other components on the motherboard overheating and the laptop has to intentionally gimp the performance to prevent itself from catching on fire lol. Fixing this ain't easy because the cooling design thermal management are inherently flawed and not suit for gaming.

gjkbjg,Dell,I agree about the pricing it's ridiculous. I was almost certain that I was going to buy the new XPS but after seeing the EU prices I am having second thoughts. Even the 16 inch MacBook Pro seems more reasonably priced than the XPS.,0.042,0.883,0.075,0.1036,1
gjkbjg,Dell,Same szenario for the EU/DE store... I really dont get it. Everyone Dell Thinkpad is trying to be like apple but they are nowhere nearly like apple.

gjkbjg,Dell,There are indeed a couple of compounded issues here. Price hike in UK / Europe compared to USA and also the Apple comparison. Here are some comparisons and spec for spec the difference is vast even if you go to checkout in the US stores and add Sales Tax. If we actually look at the prices of models equivalent to a high grade MBP.

Cali sales tax 3475 2840 I find this quite telling. The UK customers are generally getting shafted on exchange rates European customers most likely too. All in all it does make sense to probably fly to the USA to buy the laptop you want back when international travel resumes. In terms of the MBP comparison I think Dell probably are setting the prices proportionally behind Apple. They'll always be cheaper but as Apple increase their prices so will Dell.

gjkbjg,Dell,I'm having this same issue I was so excited to get the new XPS but the pricing is no where near what I was anticipating after seeing it on the US website.,0.085,0.852,0.063,-0.1881,-1
gjkbjg,Dell,was looking at the uk site and thought it wasn't too bad then noticed they're displaying the price excluding VAT. That's a bullshit trick. I want the 17 so definitely going to wait for sales too close in price to the macbook pro,0.103,0.74,0.157,0.3902,1
gjkbjg,Dell,The prices aren’t really disappointing but the configs are. If we had some decent customization options getting i7 with 8gb ram 86Wh and 256 ssd for example we could get a cheaper xps and upgrade it along the way. But there are two things to note 1 This laptop looks very expensive the screen panels are Dell only new speakers bigger touchpad double thunderbolts double ssd better build/cooling. These things cost money. 2 Dell knows we would buy the cheaper one and upgrade it ourselves which means they earn less. They wont want that at least for now people are ready to pay the premium to get these asap. Another reason why they look so expensive is the fact that Apple’s MBP16 exists and Apple has for once priced it correctly. It is a better laptop than 15 and a lighter option to 17 with better speakers and build. For the platform agnostic amongst us the Macbook makes this a very weird situation. I will probably wait for sales on the XPS and decide between MBP16 and XPS.,0.034,0.88,0.086,0.8892,1
gjkbjg,Dell,I read in another post in this sub that in June-July there's a price-drop thanks to sales and you can also save up to 60%. Obviously you can't have a 60% discount on the new XPS but even a 15/20% discount would be great. I'm looking for the i7/16/512 FHD model to replace my MacBook Pro 13 w/ Touch Bar but the price is too high for now I'll wait🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️,0.0,0.867,0.133,0.8658,1

gjkbjg,Dell,I think it's ridiculous. I didn't check for the others EU countrys but here in France the dell XPS 15 starts at € 1798.80. When you go to the US store you can have an upgraded one for this price ! I understand it's because of the VAT but come on brands couldn't do anything to make their products more affordable ? Almost all big tech brands do that thinking people in Europe will be ok buying a new device € 500 more expensive than their neighbour from across the Atlantic... It will nearly be cheaper to take a trip to the US and buy your brand new device there.

gjkbjg,Dell,Just pulled the trigger on the XPS 15 France store . 32GB FHD 1TB QWERTY .

gjnjf4,Dell,I have the 2019 base i5 model . It has the smaller 56wh battery. Note that I have the igpu only model. IIRC if I added the GPU upgrade the battery would automatically bump upto the 97wh. But I had to option to upgrade the battery without the need to get the GPU upgrade. I bought mine because I wanted the extra HDD bay. The new one has 2 NVMe option. So no need for that HDD bay IMO.,0.034,0.966,0.0,-0.3597,-1
gjnjf4,Dell,It is expected to be worse than the equivalent 7590 in terms of specs i5 8gb ram xxx gb ssd 1200p display. Since the new screen has the same 15.6 diagonal but now it is 16 10 it is actually bigger than the previous 16 9 15.6 display around 5.2% bigger as a result if the display tech is the same it will have a bit more power consumption talking just about the size . Also now the res is 1920x1200 compared to the slightly lower 1080p of last gen. Inlcuding all these changes and also the fact that 10th gen intel cpus don't offer any improvements in terms of power consumption the batterylife will the noticeably worse with the 56whr battery compared to last years base config with 56whr battery. If you see batterylife results of last year's base config anywhere online i've seen some that stated around 5-8 hours expect around 10-20% worse batterylife under the same conditions with the new 9500 base config.,0.088,0.912,0.0,-0.9343,-1
gjgqyg,Dell,Unfortunately there are less options no 8GB/256GB model with the 1650Ti and less options to customize compared to the US-store.

Therefore XPS 15 looks even more expensive than Apple in that configuration currently . I hope we will start seeing discounts on some models soon.

gjqoo9,Dell,1 - I ordered the same model and got it delivered to Perth Australia. No the delivery date was not accurate. The unit arrived over three weeks after the date specified - I think this severe delay was due to the Covid-19 situation though so it is understandable. Also Perth is one of the most isolated cities in the world so deliveries are always delayed. 2 - I am unable to answer this as this is my first XPS I have always owned Macs before this. From doing some research they seem to be well built machines. However with any windows PC you might need to fresh install windows every once in a while to keep things running smoothly.,0.101,0.862,0.037,-0.7645,-1

gju5pf,Dell,1. The issue you're speaking of is not common but alas mine doesn't sit flat with that same problem as well. I've been coding with this issue for a week and it isn't a deal breaker at all. 2. Keyboard is AMAZING. My gf and I both have our fastest WPM times on this keyboard. It's honestly awesome to use. 3. Reliable but since the laptop has Windows Hello you'll never use it. 4. All types of start-up have been very snappy for me so far even restarts. It's not something I think about at all. 5. I've only heard the fan once since I got it while updating like 45 Windows apps. Not loud at all. Honestly dude I don't think you're previous experience with Dells bodes at all with how these things perform they are awesome. The people that are loving their machines generally don't post about it. With that being said I'm not doing any heavy lifting with mine so maybe the fans would get a tiny bit loud?,0.018,0.772,0.211,0.9915,1
gju5pf,Dell,I will do my best to answer your questions from my experience with my XPS 9300 i7 / 16GB Ram / 512GB SSD / FHD non-touch. 1 - No my unit is completely stable. I have read a few people complaining of this issue on the new models however it seems the majority of people do not seem to be experiencing this problem myself included . 2- IMO the keyboard is fantastic. Having come from a Macbook this keyboard is a joy to use. Only slight issue if the positioning of the home / end / delete / arrow keys but its easy once you get used to it. If you are not sure get your self down to an electronic store and try typing on one in person! 3- The new models have windows hello so you can use Face ID to log on - it works very well in my experience i have not had to use the fingerprint scanner or pin once. Having tested the FP scanner it seems to work well. 4- This is an interesting one. The laptop wakes up pretty much instantly from sleep. HOWEVER if my laptop is not used for a while 30min - 1hr then when i open the lid the dell logo appears for approx 10-15 seconds before i can log in. I am not sure if this is meant to happen as a power saving option or if my laptop is defective but it is slightly annoying. I am sure with a bit of digging in the power management settings this can be fixed.... 5- For me I very rarely hear the fan - only when i first got the unit for a day or two whilst it was indexing and when installing software or updating the system - even then it is not super loud. I have heard that some people will have the fan on full throttle even when watching a HD youtube videos however this is something i have not experienced. I do not use it for gaming or heavy CPU usage therefore i would not be able to give a truly accurate answer. 6- Currently using the info provided from a battery report my battery's average is 7.5 hours however others are getting around the 8-10 mark. I am not sure as to why mine is under performing - I only use it for surfing the web and writing work documents....? This is something i need to look into. Other issues - i have been having problems with my BT audio - the audio stutters every 10-15 seconds. This is VERY annoying. I have tried re-installing audio driver but no fix. I suspect the issue may lie with MaxxAudio Pro Waves. - when on full volume the keys will vibrate at certain frequencies. This is slightly annoying also but i rarely have my laptop on full vol so i don't mind. Again i am not sure if this is a design floor or my unit being defective. I have a technician due to come out at the end of this month to investigate / fix both issues. Many of my posts on here fell on deaf ears so i made an effort to try and help you - I hope this helps ,0.099,0.82,0.08,-0.7601,-1

Working in TV HDMI is a must for me. I sometimes use my laptop as a VTR source for livestreams and again not having to look for a dongle is great. 16 10 I see how it could be useful for some people but pretty much everything I make and consume is 16 9.

gizo8a,Dell,Looks okay but not enough of an upgrade over the 7590 for me to justify getting it particularly with this new one still having the same graphics card. 🤔 Screen quality same ok so it's 16 10 nice but meh. Most people doing serious or prolonged work have a docking station and dual display setup so no laptop screen will ever replace that. Speaker upgrade again nice but meh wireless earbuds are very affordable and convenient and if anybody wants better sound for the odd occasion then a decent bluetooth speaker does make sense. Doesn't mean we've all been carrying around a bluetooth speaker everywhere in the past few years... If you're working on a laptop it's because you usually have to do work in a public place in a cafe bus train plane... you're going to be using headphones. If you're at home you're hooking up your laptop to your speakers. Not a fan of the irreplaceable wifi card especially if it does turn out to be Killer WiFi... I've replaced the Killer WiFi in my last two Dell laptops because of numerous issues and just the annoyance of having Killer bloat wanting to be installed i know i know i've used the Uninstaller but it still ends up coming back and just frustrating to deal with . Have they solved the heat issues? I guess we'll have to wait and see. Obviously if someone has a 9550 or older and looking to get a new laptop then for sure this would make sense. But people on a 7590 or even 9570 then these new ones are absolutely nothing special. IMO.,0.139,0.791,0.07,-0.9712,-1

gjpk8z,Dell,I’ve been looking at the same thing as well from what I can tell the answer is yes but with some caveats. For the non 2020 XPS models gaming is possible and you can run even AAA titles okay however you’ll run into thermal issues soon because the chassis isn’t equipped to handle the heat. This includes thermal throttling which will drop the FPS of your game. Apparently this can be solved by undervolting and other modifications but to a certain extent. There’s a bunch of posts on the subject I recently made one since people are drawn to the slim form factor and decent gpu so I’d advise looking through here and the forums. Not sure how the newest XPS 15 will preform but apparently it does have some improved cooling. The new XPS 17 will have a new vapour chamber which is apparently a bigger improvement on cooling.,0.032,0.847,0.121,0.9202,1

Factor in an aftermarket 100USD 1TB drive to replace the stock 256GB an upgrade they charge around double the price and you'd still get a rainbow luck of the draw NVMe drive as they don't ensure high-performance ones . Not bad for 1900USD and you have a spare 256GB drive or sell it for around 40usd . As I said else where the touch model also seems adequately priced but would really benefit from having the 8-core CPU stock.

To check this select Start Settings Ease of Access Display Adjust the text slider to 100% under Make text bigger Choose the 100% option from the drop-down menu under Make everything bigger Did you have to adjust any of these settings? Having said that the reason it's going to look blurry is because your display is set to have a specific 2560 x 1440 resolution. LCD panels like to run in at their native resolution and trying to adjust this without a dedicated graphics card to a lower resolution simply zooms in on the image which makes it look blurry. You also will not be taking full advantage of your display quality. If it's simply too small for you try leaving the display at the higher resolution and adjusting those make everything bigger and text size slider settings to fit your personal preference.

gjdtph,Dell,Sounds like a funky OS. You'll need to attempt a Windows repair. Tap F11 as soon as your BIOS completes POST and keep tapping F11 slowly until Windows 10 Advanced Startup Options shows up. Then select Troubleshoot Advanced Options and run Startup Repair. If you are still receiving BSOD or other boot failure errors during boot after the startup repair is complete go back into the Advanced Startup Options doing the same method as before except this time under Advanced Options select Command Prompt In Command Prompt type sfc /scannow and press Enter Once system file checker is complete attempt to reboot. If you're still having problems I would strongly recommend shipping the system back for a fresh wipe and reinstall of Windows since it is only weeks old. It's better for the factory to do this as they have an image of your original hard drive and they will pre-load all the necessary drivers. I mean unless of course you're feeling adventurous. In which case go for it but don't say I didn't warn you. Every driver has to be installed in a specific order and you run the risk of deleting the Dell Diagnostics partition if you reinstall Windows and end up formatting the drive. If this wasn't a new system I would say let's do it. But it's not. It's brand new. Just get them to wipe and reinstall that boot drive and you'll be good to go.,0.058,0.843,0.098,0.7145,1

I think I’ll try to hold out on ordering anything until I see some user reviews. What other laptops are you considering? I’ve been eyeing the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. I’m not sure if I want to actually get a “gaming laptop” but it looks pretty subdued and would likely outperform the xps while saving a few hundred dollars. Unfortunately it doesn’t have a webcam.

As indy runner15 suggests you could go with the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. That seems nice dave2d review .

gj4os4,Dell,I think with the XPS line it's really a hit or a miss. I currently have the 7590 and have had no problems at all save for some thermal throttling and thermal issues. I was able to fix all of that through a proper undervolt process I tested each undervolt until I would BSOD . I haven't really experienced any other issues other than that though. I'm not sure if it has to do with quality control or if I don't know much about computers but my unit has been amazing!

giq99c,Dell,This sounds more like a software issue instead of a hardware issue. I would recommend backing up your laptop to an external drive with software like Acronis True Image and completely reinstall Win10. When reinstalling Win10 there's a few things you should do. Beforehand go to the dell support website and download ALL drivers/software packages for your laptop and stick it on a USB drive or something. I'd recommend NOT connecting to the internet during the installation process because a It will force you to create a microsoft account which you don't want your PC to be attached to and b it will auto-install drivers that are likely to be out of date compared to the ones you got from Dell's website. So reinstall win10 install all drivers from the USB. I also recommend using PC decrapifyer to uninstall dell bloatware and please use Win10Debloater to uninstall default Win10 bloat Office trial candy crush Minecraft netflix etc... This will ensure the cleanest installation of Win10 possible. After you're done I recommend imaging your hard drive again so you can restore to that state later if you run into problems again. Ninja edit -- I will add These were the first steps I followed when I received my 7590 this past January. It was plagued with software issues sleep issues windows explorer 1909 bug bloat issues internet issues . Reinstalling Windows the stable 1903 update fixed all of these for me. ALSO Look up how to disable S1 Modern Sleep. It's a sleep mode designed for Surface tablets that for some reason Dell enables on their laptops causing weird sleep behavior and major battery drainage.,0.031,0.85,0.12,0.9727,1
giq99c,Dell,Your first step is to ensure your system is configured properly. There are settings in BIOS and OS that prevents S3 sleep. FYI. There are only 2 sleep states S3 sleep S4 hibernate and S5 power off. S1/S2 refers different working states unrelated to this issue. Navigate the power option in control panel and go into advanced setting to ensure everything is correct. Google it if you need to. I will not repeat those available on Google. 1 your first step is to ensure you have a healthy sleep state. Set your sleep timer to 1min boot clean then observe your system goes to S3 sleep then wake it up. You want to do this a few times to make sure you don't have a intermittent sleep problem. If necessary use CMD to run 'powercfg -requests' to troubleshoot anything prevent S3. You need to unplug everything when do this - some USB/other devices may wake the system up in wake-on-LAN or other similar events. 2 repeat step 1 with power connected. This verifies your S3 is healthy even when power is plugged. Note the system has different setting when adapter is connected. 3 Leave the system in S3 for 10-20mins observe any screen lit or temperature rise on keyboard the hot spot is near the F9 key which suggests OS secretly wake up due to some events. If you have a Fluke meter with thermal probe you can do this fairly easily. 4 If you have gone through 1 - 3 then you are sure your OS is OK. Now get to the software part. Open browser Office and everything you could think of. Then leave system idle to trigger S3 and let it sit to observe abnormal screen/thermal events. This normally happen in 10-20mins if it happens. 5 if system overheats in step 4 use binary search to identify which software/element is causing this. This would take a few hours but it will systematically find out what causes your problem.,0.023,0.897,0.079,0.8531,1
giq99c,Dell,If you’re tech savvy enough to go through all those troubleshooting steps it’s safe to assume you also undervolt your 9570? I say this because I’ve done that to mine and experience the same thing when I go high enough to keep stable during use but not enough to supply the processor enough juice to wake from sleep. If not the undervolt then it definitely has to do with one of Dell’s crapware messing with the system. I couldn’t recall if it was a fresh format that I did to my machine or a BIOS update that I applied that fixed the issue but seeing that you’ve already gone through the helpful troubleshooting I’d guess the former.,0.0,0.857,0.143,0.9343,1

gj5aur,Dell,This is a good question and one I've been asking myself although from a different perspective. I have a 4K 9550 i7-6600HQ and have always found it a bit sluggish which I've always thought was the hardware struggling to drive the high resolution display. Yes it's nice to know that the display is amazing but I can honestly say that for me I think it's been more trouble than it's worth. Support for HiDPI in a few applications that I use has been a bit ropey and I can't be doing with workarounds and hacks just so I can see things properly. Four years on I have no doubt that there's now sufficient performance to push all those pixels around but I'm asking myself if I'd miss it if speccing a replacement with a FHD panel. I certainly don't look at the 24 FHD displays I use with my desktop and think that they look crap and there are way fewer DPI there. So go FHD in a new 9500 and save myself a few hundred and hopefully release more performance for the things I really care about being snappy?,0.094,0.751,0.155,0.9062,1
gj5aur,Dell,In the software world we're not going to see loss of lo-dpi support for a very long time things are mostly just moving toward being able to nicely scale. It almost entirely depends on what battery life tradeoffs you want to make whether you want to sometimes deal with stuff being scaled incorrectly on the 4k display and whether you care about the extra pixel density.,0.032,0.812,0.157,0.7964,1

gj231s,Dell,AMD is a big gamble when you need to rebuild the laptop's internals from the ground up and lose Thunderbolt. Not only that but you get a problem where a good portion of consumers are stuck in the mindset of AMD can't compete with Intel on desktop let alone mobile. All of this makes it a very dangerous proposition to put AMD in your flagship laptop. I've seen the poll results heavily favoring AMD at the moment and it's pretty clear that this community is eager to see the new stuff. That's good but there are going to be teething issues. What if there's worse stuff than it's a bit of a fireball and some issues can't be fixed? Would you still buy it? The other issue is AMD's power management isn't quite as fine-tuned as Intels so we're going to see higher idle utilization on AMD as well which means we won't get the battery life we expect out of the same battery sizes. All in all it'd be great to see AMD in there but I think that Dell would be delivering a rushed unfinished platform if they'd done that.,0.087,0.766,0.148,0.9379,1

In anything like this class of system tiny laptop with Intel-U processor there will be no meaningful difference from upgrading to DDR4 even LPDDR4-4266 it simply won't matter period. The sole exception is for iGPU performance when e.g gaming but if you care much about this then a laptop with Intel HD 620 is probably not the right choice from the outset and you should wait for the refresh anyway Ice Lake has a much better iGPU which is already much more significant than the RAM anyway .,0.054,0.837,0.109,0.8929,1

ginhql,Dell,Most Dell machines come with 10% factory wear which is actually intended bad calibration. Li-Po batteries degrade faster when charging the 90-100% of their true capacity along with trickle charging at 99-100%. Some companies feel the bite on customer support. Knowing the typical consumer will not wisely avoid those limitations or program his charge schedule to compensate for them they just ship with 10% wear. Of course all claims of battery longevity in marketing material do not account for the synthetic wear and reviewers get models without this most of the times. There are ways to manually remove the 10% wear. Google it for your model. The 1% off is either real wear or within margin of error of sensors.,0.087,0.857,0.056,-0.6179,-1

Both machines still work great and are going strong. Downside is the weight but with a professional machine and power it carries wouldn’t mind. At least it doesn’t look like a gaming laptop and build quality is also there to appeal instead of these plastic laptops.

gi8m7h,Dell,Undervolting is unlickely to void warranty but will advice to be discrete on that aspect. Youve many options. One could be to call Dell and explain the overheating issues they will run a couple of test and probably help you with a solution. Even a huge repair like a motherboard replacement or fan replacement can not be the solution. If youve a working machine now you will have the same issues in the future and have to find what software wise works for you. Tweaking Dell devices can sometimes be a huge pain. First of all youve to know more about why your CPU temps are so high. What are your iddle temps max temps max clocks etc... Have you tried cleaning the fans ? Or repasting with a quality paste ? That can make miracles. I would go for a fresh windows 10 install make sure all drivers are working properly and repaste the thing could make a huge difference as well as some pads on vrms etc if possible. x200B Also make sure your undervolt is really effective and see if you can increase it if possible how much undervolt youre running right now ?

giat2p,Dell,How are you using it? Are you using it plugged in 90% of the time? If so you should change the Dell Power Plan setting from Adaptive to Primarily AC use.

Well I know it's some small spec for big games but whatever I can run them smooth and I'm fine with it Of course battery life isn't good but I doesn't really care since I always plug it whenever I go Idk if yours has higher spec but I think you can give it a try Also I don't have any thermal / throttling issue I usually clean the fan every 3-4 month ,0.098,0.763,0.139,0.4321,1

giemnr,Dell,incoming rant... My laptop i got in user tag years after I graduated bought laptop in 2019 graduated 2017 . That said I'd suggest looking elsewhere before considering a dell g7/g5. The BIOS has been a CONSTANT issue for many people with this laptop and pending on what version you get will determine how unhappy you will be. Issues include but not limited to stuttering/freezing bad thermal performance fan curves lack of options for powefan profiles etc. Look into some other brands and see if you can get opinions on how users feel with that model like you are here. As far as battery goes you can reasonably expect poor life with just about any gaming laptop as far as I am aware. This line I'd say you can reasonably expect 2 maybe 3 hours mild use. Performance on battery will be heavily reduced. With full tweaking you can expect enough performance to watch 1080p 60 fps youtube but thats pushing it. If you DO decide to get one heres what I did with my laptop which is a slight upgrade and/or different from the g5 to mitigate most of the issues and max performance thermal i redid my thermal paste for CPU/GPU screen color upgraded to a 120hz panel storage replaced HDD with 1TB SSD ram upgraded from 16 to 32GB bios stopped updating after 1.9 wish i could go back to 1.3 i hear its the best for my model power options tweaked settings so CPU doesn't throttle as bad on battery can disable nvidia GPU in device manager for a more performance. surface temp i rigged a fan setup at my desk to cool everything down just that bit extra. unless they fixed issues after my model made in 2018 doubt it you can expect similar fun times All said and done however for the price I got mine 880 300 in upgrades it isn't a bad laptop that does great while plugged in and is adequate enough for short stints on battery. Desktop performance lets me run Destiny 2 1080p 60fps highest settings etc. TL DR look elsewhere before considering dell IMO. Linus Tech Tips constantly does laptop reviews. If you're serious about using for classes I suggest getting a more battery friendly laptop not gaming ,0.08,0.821,0.099,0.874,1

gi8bmf,Dell,I have 9360 and I agree it's generally a great laptop but I must say that the Wireless card I had in my top-end build was complete garbage. Had lots of disconnects and slow downs. After I replaced it with Intel 9260 I had no more wifi issues whatsoever. Another thing was coil whine. Disabling C-states in the BIOS resolved the issue. Then sleep issues on Windows but not Linux this resolved the issue And finally audio popping also only on Windows resolved with the help of this thread Now the only issues I have is the lack of a trackpoint like on Thinkpads or trackball as I despise touchpads and that the keyboard is just okay as opposed to keyboard on Thinkpads which is usually good but since I do no longer work on my personal computer therefore XPS is a solid device I'd buy again at that time especially considering that with external GPU and monitor it runs even new games very well I'm playing M B Bannerlord on it recently .

gi6r5p,Dell,Of course it will work and charge your laptop. It will also display up to 1 4k screen or 2 1080p screens.If you want it only to charge the laptop there are cheaper options docks from dell that can do the work these high end WD19 make sense only for dual 4k monitor etc... and this option is only de 180W option. Basicly the same as a WD15 i think You can also use the OEM portable battery from dells that use usb C. You could connect the battery to the charger and charge the battery with de dell power brick you have. Im not 100% sure but i think you can charge both at a time. 2nd hand docks sells for way cheaper. Any dell dock will do the trick if you need a dock. If you need to be on the go portable battery is better with the advantage that can always have a power bank with you in case you need one. Try posting in dell oficial forum. Prepared people there might help you with much more details than me. Ps. The laptops fans are runing at 2500rpms constantly while docked. So you intend to you it use normally without external monitor keyboard etc... only charging it might get noisy ... I can still get up to 10 hours of battery from a single cycle. Portable battery charges the device up to 80%. Just confirm you can charge your laptop while charging the battery but im pretty sure you can Wish you luck,0.037,0.855,0.109,0.9706,1

See Exceptions to consumer guarantees If you have a minor problem with a product or service the business can choose to give you a free repair instead of a replacement or refund. When you have a major problem with a product you have the right to ask for your choice of a replacement or refund. For a major problem with a service you can choose to receive compensation for the drop in value below the price paid or a refund. Read your own laws.

gi2sjt,Dell,I'm in Victoria Australia and have had a similar experience to you twice I had to take Dell to VCAT. If you are the complainant it only costs about 200 non-refundable to get a hearing but it's a small price to pay if you've forked out 4k for a premium laptop which you expect to work for many years. Not unreasonable. We have one of the best consumer laws in the world. Under Australian Consumer Law all goods are expected to last a reasonable amount of time. And that reasonable amount of time is SEVEN years. Period. Anyways as soon as a hearing date was set Dell immediately gave me a full refund. I'm assuming it would've cost them more than just the refund if they had to defend themselves court costs 'strike' against their name etc. Most people don't take it this far and Dell know this so they get away with it! But if more people stood up to these giants they would think twice about making products that don't last. We've all heard of planned obsolescence. Don't give up mate! Sooner or later they will give you your money back. Cheers hopefully I've been of help.,0.014,0.9,0.086,0.9564,1
gi2sjt,Dell,You can tell them you want an onsite technician. I am not convinced these mobile contracted workers are the best but the motherboard replacement is straight forward just make sure there aren't any screws left over. Honestly it would be irrational for a company to give you a refund after so long. For all they know you've had your laptop on your bed being smothered by a heavy comforter the entire time of its ownership. I had my motherboard replaced because it overheated evidently it is common and the part that goes bad was fixed coming from the repair contractor not a reliable source . If you call them and tell them you would like an onsite repair they are allowed to give you one onsite repair as a freebie. That will cut the repair time down to less than a week instead of 2 .,0.09,0.75,0.161,0.888,1

gi4yu0,Dell,The SL3 screen ratio is excellent for productivity I didn't think I'd notice the extra vertical space but you really do,0.0,0.89,0.11,0.3291,1
gi4yu0,Dell,I have the 2-in-1 and I use my notebook for coding and it works perfectly well and I love the clarity of UHD display--I've never gotten eye strain in the 8 months I've owned this notebook while I used to get eyestrain from my previous notebooks constantly. That being said the SL3 has a taller 3 2 display ratio so if you're coding you'll be able to see more lines of code on it than the XPS 13 9300. I think the SL3 is a fantastic notebook but it has more dated I/O ports than the XPS 13 9300. If you're comparing the FHD XPS 13 9300 to the SL3 the SL3 has the taller higher resolution display less eye strain but the 9300 has slimmer bezels more modern ports and better battery life only with the FHD display . I think both are great notebooks and you'll be happy with either. Also hashtags don't work on reddit.,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.977,1
ghz3zu,Dell,Yes you can undervolt to keep the Laptop from throttling but your best bet also is to set the the Turbo Boost power long and short to 25 watts which even at 3.0-3.2 ghz will still give good performance whilst lowering temperatures to those more less depending on the ambient temp also I would suggest undervolting the dGPU too to allow it to maintain higher boost clocks as when it reaches 75 degrees it will reduce somewhat. I wouldnt necessarily recommend disabling turbo also especially when the game you are playing can have a performance hit due to a cpu capped lower and your better off with 25 watts again,0.057,0.703,0.239,0.9752,1
gi3xt5,Dell,HDMI does go above 60 just depends on which version. Some monitors only have HDMI 1.4 port but yet they still work with 144hz.

gi3sej,Dell,Some conflicting info on the spec sheet for that one... Says Power through the work day with the latest Intel i7 Quad Core™ processor option but then also only mentions Intel Core™ i3 i5 and i7 processors up to i7-35x0M which wouldn't actually include any quad cores. I'm assuming that at some point a BIOS update added quad support so I'd definitely start there. EDIT Does the BIOS identify all 4 cores?,0.024,0.877,0.098,0.7696,1

gi3sej,Dell,Update I think I figured it out. When the laptop is plugged in or docked ie on AC power it recognizes all cores and threads. Confirmed in dxdiag cpu-z and CB15 and CB20. 4 cores 8 threads when plugged in. On battery power it seems to disable hyperthreading. Only 4 processes run and from what I can tell it is using 4 cores just no HT. I could be wrong though our cups be disabling two cores on battery. Now I get to muck about in battery settings to see if I can disable that lovely /s feature.,0.087,0.873,0.04,-0.5574,-1
gi3n0c,Dell,I have same configuration as you I can tell you what helped me reduce temps. Undervolting using ThrottleStop Turning off HyperThreading in BIOS Yes I know that by turning off HyperThreading you will reduce cores from 8 to 4 but this gives me much more higher and stable performance and reduced temps. As for undervolt it decreased my temps by about 5 degrees which is not much but was just enough to stop it from thermal throttling the GPU. Good luck!,0.037,0.81,0.153,0.8735,1

ghw8nc,Dell,It's a known issue. It happened to me once your CPU is stuck at 800Mhz.

Did a windows system reset update and security reset Screenpad still black. Only the touchpad function works 2. Updated Intel display driver devices update driver 3. Went to Asus site to download latest screenpad drivers and installed them using powershell in admin mode screenpad precision touchbar driver and screenpad display driver pnputil -i -a path to inf file 4. Downloaded screenpad upgrader tool from the same site 5. Ran the upgrader tool again. This time it didn't stop at 35% yay! . It restarts the laptop several times. 6. Once it's done the upgrader tool asks you to install Asus hotkeys from Microsoft store already installed for me 7. It also asks you to install screenxpert app from the store. This app is somehow not reachable through Google or store search. But this is the link Someone shared this on reddit. After all this my screenpad started working again.,0.0,0.928,0.072,0.9249,1

gpnhql,ASUS,I own this laptop with the exact specs you have. It's true that this laptop heats up like crazy and has aggressive fan profiles. Another redditor and I both swapped out our thermal paste for liquid metal. Turns out the GPU and CPU dies and heatsinks are quite optimal for dealing with liquid metal. Both of us experienced 10 C drops in idle and peak temps under load. Unfortunately due to the way this laptop draws most of its air from the grille above the keyboard a laptop cooler just won't yield effective results. Hope this helps somewhat 👍🏾,0.081,0.771,0.148,0.8095,1
gpnhql,ASUS,I have the ASUS Zephryus GA502 w/ 1660ti Max Q and Ryzen 7 3750H. On idle I am at around 45C-50C. On some load like with Photoshop for 3 hours I am hovering 70C-80C. With a simple elevation stand 15 that raises the laptop one inch off the surface I was seeing 5C-10C decrease and on load as well. With a cooling pad I was seeing the same results. The way my laptop was designed air flow circulation is limited to the area above they keyboard. The cooling pad helped but not as much as I would like due to the design of my asus laptop. NOTE I also like my 15 stand over my laptop ran cooler because it is portable. It folds nearly and I can put it in my laptop bag. I use this set up with me everywhere. GOOD AIRFLOW ON THE GO 🙂. Feel free to check out this video. This helped me a lot on determining whether or not a laptop cooler is best for me.

gpnhql,ASUS,Now usually raising the laptop by a couple of degrees can help out. Just having a laptop stand could help performance a bit but it varies of course. I got the GA502DU and put a cooling pad underneath it and the temps stayed about the same but the performance actually increased. I don't know about yours but when I took mine apart to add another SSD I noticed the vents for the fans were blocked off. Probably to keep dust from the fans. I took off the metal plates and paper and my temps went from around 90-93 C to about 78-84 C when gaming. Hope any of this helps.,0.024,0.847,0.129,0.8898,1

gpnhql,ASUS,Watercool it,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gpnhql,ASUS,No need for additional cooling just undervolt your cpu and set your fan speed to 100%. If you want you could also replace thermal paste for a better one but not necessarily at all. And better buy something like rubber legs for laptop or small stand just so laptop is rised above the table a little so it could take more air in but really there is no reason to buy cooling pad with fans for your laptop as they work good only for some laptops which designs allows laptop to take more air from cooling pad and also it would at BEST decrease your temperatures by about -5 compared to just a little stand without coolers. Hope this information would help you! ,0.055,0.76,0.184,0.9614,1
gpwyak,ASUS,Okay so you need to specify the exact temperatures of your CPU/GPU. 80-90c is absolutely fine for a CPU in a thin gaming laptop however it's not okay if you're GPU is hitting those temps. Anything above 84c for the GPU and like 92-93c for the CPU is considered bad. So download Afterburner and monitor your temps properly first. There are a few things you can do before repasting. You can undervolt your CPU undervolt your GPU and even limit your CPU turbo boost. Make sure you know how to do these things first. Also since it's a new laptop you can send it in for them to repaste it for you if you don't wanna void the warranty. Otherwise if you're confident enough just repaste it yourself! If the laptop was in fact just sitting there for 2 years there always a probability that the thermal paste degraded.,0.051,0.854,0.095,0.7201,1

gppo22,ASUS,I also have the Asus TUF a15 but I must disagree. Performance is better than expected.

gppo22,ASUS,Im getting an rtx version soon too. But it might be due to the ram not having another stick for dual channel. that alone bumps the fps by 30-40 percent. Another thing is that laptops tend to run slower if not plugged in.,0.045,0.955,0.0,-0.25,-1
gppo22,ASUS,I'm not experienced with Fortnite but I heared it's quite a heavy game surprisingly. Anyways try the following things Basics - Make sure you're playing while the laptop is charging you're probably doing this already . The battery can't deliver enough power for a powerful GPU thus lowering the performance. Windows settings - Right click the battery icon in the taskbar down below and click Windows Mobility Center . One of the tiles shows an image of a battery and probably have balanced in that same tile. Click on the balanced and set that to High Performance . This will increase the maximum power delivered to your laptop which means more performance but will lower battery life. NVidia Control Panel - Right click the desktop then NVidia Control Panel. In the menu on the left click Manage 3D Settings . In the list of settings scroll down to Power Management Mode . Set this to Prefer maximum performance . This tells the GPU that performance is more important than battery life. Now on that same page go to Program Settings . Check if Fortnite is in the list of programs. If this is not the case click Add Browse and go to wherever fortnite is installed possibly C Program Files Epic Games Fortnite . Add whatever starts Fortnite I expect this to be Fortnite or Fortnite.exe . If it is in the list ignore that part. Set the power management in this list also if this is not on prefer maximum performance . - Make sure it uses High Performance NVidia Processor how however it's called and not Integrated Graphics or Auto Select . This forces the game to run on the NVidia GPU. - In the control panel click Adjust image settings with preview in the left menu. Select Use my performance emphasizing and set this to performance. This will reduce the graphics a bit there's a preview so you can see the effects directly for a bit of extra performance. Fans I do not know where to change this in an ASUS laptop so somebody or the interwebs else might be able to help out. Your fans cool down your device. It could be that the temperatures in the laptop might be too high to squeeze out extra performance. Setting the fan curve to a more aggressive one fans blow earlier and harder might get some extra performance but you'll have to check if that is possible with that laptop I assume it is and how to do that. This should help a lot already. Do keep in mind that advertised performance is measured in a perfect scenario possibly with overclocked hardware which I absolutely do not recommend doing in a laptop or that it was measured with the strongest GPU that is in that series. There should be a list of specs somewhere on which version of the laptop this was tested on.,0.028,0.885,0.086,0.9827,1

gpfhbq,ASUS,Well depending on what failed you might be able to fix the laptop yourself. If it's just heat re-pasting installing a fresh Windows image and then undervolting responsibly may help. If it's the battery you can replace those from online stores depending on the model. Keep in mind just like re-pasting this could require a lot of work on your part but to save a 3000 investment I believe it's worth it. As for other suggestions to find better quality unfortunately many modern laptops follow the recent trend of going as thin and light as possible... Which of course leads to stability issues on more powerful hardware. You should check out Jarrod's Tech on YouTube. He gives unbiased reviews on hardware and isn't afraid to lay into a system if it doesn't meet his standards. The machines he reviews tend to be gaming laptops. Keep in mind more often than not on this forum even you're more likely to run into people who have problems with a product because if it's working fine most people don't have an interest in participating with the forums. But if there is a problem they'll let everybody know. Of course in th case of ASUS the general consensus is they're shit now. The G14 might buy them some praise but I don't expect it'll be long before thermal issues start to pop up with that thing. The new Alienware M15 R3 features vapor chamber cooling which has been known to be handy but since it just launched it'll be some time before we know if it helps much... Plus the Alienware price jump is something to be concerned about. Overall just research machines before you buy them.

You'll need to buy ram kit like 8x2 or 16x2 or just buy 1 more stick of ram with same specs to your ones. Because when ram is in dual channel mode it will increase fps by about 40% or more because 1 stick of ram becomes bottleneck. I can recommend buying Corsair Vengeance ram 2666mhz.,0.0,0.869,0.131,0.8316,1

gp4y97,ASUS,The 706II is listed as having the R5 not R7 when I google it. x200B I have the 706Iu and it has the R7 4800. After getting settled into it I'm loving the snappyness of it. I play Battlefield V CS GO Which is CPU driven an flies Planetside2 and couple other titles and it handles sessions no problem. It does get loud during a AAA game session but after enabling vsync an locking monitor to 60hz for power saving and locking in fps to 60 max its very manageable sound wise with the fans. So the 15 incher might be easier to tote around but loses a couple inches of screen estate to the bigger brother 706 and if you like gaming or watching HDR movies etc I'd grab the 17. Registering at Asus forums is a pia make sure to do it after getting one to get into Rog fourms. Also as Ive learned have a couple flash drives for troubleshooting an restoring they recommend having at least 8gb flashdrive for making a reinstall media and another flashdrive to back up eSupport folder on SSD that holds all the first run and basic drivers the laptop needs to be returned to stock form as well as anything else you may aquire along way you want to install immediately after a wipe if needed. Something i noticed is a lot of the 15 inch Tufs come with one stick of ram which means the system runs in single channel mode. The 17s come with pairs of ram modules so they are in dual channel out of the box. x200B Hope it helps and you enjoy your new laptop either one. Report back which way you roll. x200B Edit to add the 17 in my case comes with a 90whr battery and most 15 come with a 48 to 76whr it will be a noticeable difference there when away from a plug in.,0.024,0.853,0.123,0.9866,1

goega1,ASUS,The G75 and that whole jet engine design series was so badass. Now all ASUS machines are these flimsy super thin ultrabook style machines that favor aesthetics over consistent internal cooling. They use these crappy AMD-in-tandem-with-GPU systems that share heat pipes between the two and crappy buggy software to regulate temps and voltages software that mind you breaks half the time under the most normal of circumstances. All this results in temps that regularly climb into the mid to high 90s which for modern processing architectures is actually within spec but still hot enough for concern when the failure threshold is just above 100 degrees Celsius. The fear of having these software systems break and fail to cool the processors in time to prevent damage is one of the many reasons I hardly ever touch my GA502. All this could be avoided if they just nut up and make the machines a little thicker with better pasting dedicated heat pipes and bigger fans and the jet engine series as I like to call them is proof they can do this and still have the laptops looking quite nice and very portable. In fact I favor the old aesthetic from a purely visual standpoint as well. I don't know what it is about gaming PC manufacturers feeling like everything has to be as thin and light as possible. This is a tangent frankly this whole comment is but the cell phone industry did this excessively until like three years ago when they realized they simply can't pack all these features into an ultra-slim ultra-light design without making concessions on the battery and heat yes phones and tablets can overheat and it happens more often than many think . Now you'll notice cell phones are getting bigger and heavier with better displays tonplacate the ignorant masses who thought slim-and-light was just the bee's knees. The big difference with cell phones is that if your battery gets too hot expands punctures itself on an internal component and ignites your handheld device just turned into a chemical bomb. On a laptop however the thing will just fail to operate before anything gets hot enough to physically harm the user... But you'll still have lost some expensive hardware. So why haven't PC manufacturers taken notes on this? It's not just an ASUS issue Dell has the same fixation with their Alienware M15/M17 series being super thin and while those do actually function better under most circumstances even while hot 90 Celsius range they can control the throttling and still deliver consistent performance they shouldn't be getting that hot in the first place.

gnr09e,ASUS,That's a sign of a dying ROM or even the flash chip itself. I fixed some Motorolas in the past who had similar problems booting up and/or crashing and fixed it by reinstalling the ROM on the phone. You'll need a Windows PC the ROM for that specific ASUS device and a flash tool. Every manufacturer has its own tools. By googling it's likely that you'll find a tutorial on how to flash ASUS phones or even THAT specific phone. After reinstalling the ROM completely the problem should be gone. If it STILL happens it's a hardware failure Though unlikely since your phone boots up Since you go through the steps of flashing a complete ROM you could check out LineageOS. It's an Android that doesn't come with bloatware and is 100% pure even the Play Store you must flash manually. Currently it's on Android 10 Would be an upgrade for you faster than ASUS lol Plus points by installing this ROM mentioned above The tutorial has you 100% covered and you just need to follow the steps. If you want to revert later it's possible. Just search for the stock ROM Little caveat By flashing Lineage you might void your warranty.,0.044,0.924,0.032,-0.539,-1

go3967,ASUS,Use HWMonitor to check your voltages and temps. Sometimes the ASUS Armoury Crate 'performance' profile fixes this by maxing out the fans and regulating clock speed. Of you don't have Armoury Crate installed just know you need to. It is absolutely essential for the function of any gaming on most ASUS laptops. Arpiry Crate tends to break itself under the most mundane circumstances however so make sure if you're installing it to reboot after the install is finished and also have all the AMD/Chipset/Vega drivers installed. AMD handles cooperation with graphics cards in a weird kind of 'sharing' mode which can sometimes read usually cause issues unless the workload environment is perfectly within the variables Armoury Crate and the Vega drivers expect to receive.,0.013,0.934,0.053,0.7251,1

If the fan is clean and you have inspected that there are no broken or chipped fan blades the most likely thing is the bearing is/has failed. Just replace the fan. Most have an ID or part number of some sort Google/EBay/Amazon that. New fan is usually a few dollars. Unplug the old a couple screws replace with the new.

gnd34s,ASUS,That’s literally what heat pipes are supposed to do but if your exhaust vents are clogged or fans are not moving air either not spinning fast enough or have blockages then the heat pipes can’t TRANSFER the heat away. Replacing the thermal compound as other suggested will only transfer more heat from the chip to the heat pipes but if the heat transfer after that is the actual problem it won’t make any difference and may even make that spot hotter as more heat can be transferred in to the pipe from the chip.,0.065,0.935,0.0,-0.7469,-1

gnd34s,ASUS,Are you seeing high temps on your CPU and GPU using HWINFO64 to check. Also check to make sure the radiators just behind those fans arent clogged with dust if they are then likely thats the problem. You can clean them out using compressed air if you want the quick and easy way. Or for a proper clean you can remove the heat pipes and radiators and give it a proper clean its simple enough to do and so long as you dont go bashing about trying to force things you wont break anything whilst you have the heat pipes and radiators up you could swap out the thermal paste to some arctic silver stuff doubt it will make a great deal of measurable difference though .,0.038,0.827,0.136,0.91,1

gnd34s,ASUS,those should get hot they are transferring heat from your components that need heat dissipation to the back of your laptop to be dissipated by your fans. the only way to make them cooler is to have the fans run fastelouder. don't listen to anyone telling you to replace your thermal compound the job of the compound is to form a seal between the copper heatsink and the component you are transferring heat from. better compound more heat transferred to pipe. hot pipe good transfer good compound. the pipe SHOULD feel hot to you. it is not hot to the components. heck it's probably only 50 celsius which would feel like it is burning you but is completely fine for your pc. if you want it to run cooler turn up the fans. that's your only real option. this is just a problem when it comes to putting high performance in a thin chassis. you don't have much buffer room between the heatsinks and your lap and will feel that heat.,0.02,0.914,0.066,0.6297,1

gnd34s,ASUS,Well they are heat pipes they will get hot because of the amount of heat transferred inside them.

gmsi0c,ASUS,Undervolt the GPU in MSI afterburner unfortunately no undervolt can be done on mobile AMD chips run fans at max speed limit fps to match the refreshrate of your screen so the GPU doesn't have to work overtime. And that would be it i think softwarewise if you don't want to sacrifice the performance ofc. You can also check the new BIOS changelog on ASUS website maybe they adjusted fan profiles. Repaste the CPU and GPU with better thermal compund not sure if that will void the warranty . Check if the heatsink is properly seated. I'm afraid that these high temps are caused by the maxed thermal headroom on ASUS part. You are getting crazy performance in a very compact chassis. The result is high thermals unfortunately. 90-95C is within spec however i would avoid running in these temps as it will shorten your G14's lifespan.,0.096,0.87,0.034,-0.7639,-1
gmsi0c,ASUS,Follow my guide to properly disable boosting. I’ve actually used M B Bannerlord myself to test different power modes and profiles and with the 2.9/3GHz cap from boosting disabled you are looking at a minimal performance loss with a 10-20 degrees Celsius cooler.

gmmnyx,ASUS,Idk have never seen benchmarks of the 4800h but with modern laptops in gaming it's usually the gpu that's the bottleneck.,0.057,0.943,0.0,-0.0516,-1
gmmnyx,ASUS,i have the same cpu but i have rtx 2060,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gmmnyx,ASUS,No matter what GPU you choose with that CPU all of them will be bottlenecked. Most of the games don't use the CPU that much so in 99% of the cases you'll see your CPU utilisation at 30% while the GPU is at 99%. That doesn't mean you won't get some good performance out of it. It's about that in terms of graphic intensive games the CPU will always wait for the GPU no matter if it's an 2080ti or a 1650ti it's only about what performance that graphics card can push in the end. To give you an example with the CPU at 30% utilisation and the 1650ti at 100% utilisation you will get 60FPS in a specific game While in the same scenario but with an 2080ti will get 100fps at 100% GPU utilisation.

Instead of giving supervisor access to the SATA options like in the tutorial enable supervisor access on Overclocking Performance Menu and then flash it. Make sure you keep a backup if you do it because if something goes wrong you’ll be able to revert it. When you go back into BIOS this menu will be there go into it and enable XTU interface now you’ll be able to undervolt in throttlestop or XTU. I hope this helps!

In my experience and I prefer to do everything by e-mail! it takes at least 3-4 days for most major companies to reply to e-mail messages. I've actually been quite impressed with ASUS Australia's customer service - I sent them an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and much to my surprise I got an e-mail back in about two days... They referred me onto another department ASUS Australia and having sent a fresh e-mail i.e. my enquiry was not referred internally I got a reply just one day later! I wouldn't go as far as saying ASUS Australia has the best customer service - that honor should probably go to Brother Australia who officially support Linux users I might add! - but their customer service standard has definitely been one of the better ones whenever I've had to deal with ASUS Australia in the past...

ASUS here's an idea. Here's what you used to do. Ship the PC with hardware that gets recognized and controlled by Windows and BIOS so we don't have the rancid incompatibility performance and stability issues like we do with the new ones. You know... Like Dell Alienware MSI Lenovo... They don't force us to use this bullshit and their machines work fine. And on top of that the shitty software solutions ASUS makes us use don't even fucking work half the time. Why do I need to have ASUS's spyware/adware/bloatware installed on my laptop just to use it for its primary purpose which is gaming? Why does the software not even function without literally dozens of end user workarounds? What the fuck happened? Why do I need to do your job for you ASUS? Don't you have engineers that can figure this shit out before release?

Their response was to offer an RMA repair and then to tell me that because I've removed the bottom panel of the laptop which you're supposed to do if you want to expand storage and some of the screws pushed 'dimples' into the shitty plastic frame that it may be considered physical damage and the warranty revoked. I mean what the fuck? ASUS used to be a fantastic brand. The ASUS G75VW was an incredible machine back in 2013. And now I've got this 1 200 flimsy plastic inherently flawed laptop and I'm not even guaranteed it'll get looked at when I submit it for RMA beyond those aforementioned dimples.

gjg0u7,ASUS,I have one in use for about 2 weeks and at first I was really disappointed. This device really has a problem with temperatures when in stock conditions. At first battery run time was not near to those values represented in youtube reviews but with the newest firmware 5 to 6 1/2 hours with below mentioned office tasks are realistic which is pretty sweet in my opinion. Overall build quality is more than OK for the price available ports are also decent and I like the look because it looks not gamey . I ve bought mine for 1350 EUR 4800HS 1660TI 16GB RAM 1 TB NVME incl. Taxes compared to the G14 in the same configuration rougly 2000 EUR incl. Taxes this notebook offers good value. Coming from a desktop I ve always found it somewhat strange that temperatures from 85 - 95 C are considered normal for a notebook. I personally can accept temperatures around 80 C if they occur under heavy performance duties aka gaming. Average CPU GPU Temperatures with below tweaks Office tasks like browsing coding watching videos 41 - 54 C Gaming Bannerlord Total War Warhammer 2 65 - 72 C Unfortunately the fans are not software controllable yet so when doing office tasks my temps will slowly increase from 40 to 54 C and the fans then will start working. Software related Probably the most f upped power plan settings I ve ever seen did result the device to deliver a minimum 100 % of power to the cpu - CPU temps when browsing avg. 65 - 67 C Can be solved by reducing minimum wattage to 3 - 5 % the device will constantly boost the cpu under heavy conditions like gaming even if it is not even close to necessary set maximum wattage to 99 % this will cause lower base clock speeds which is not what you want or modify one entry in the registry so you can disabling CPU-boost in the power plan settings. As this CPU is game changing powerful I did not notice any differences. the Armoury Crate Performance Settings do some really strange things on my device so I ve set the mode to Windows and modified two power plan settings that I am comfortable with Hardware related the pasting is really poor I estimate the Dies have been covered by about 95 % I have repasted every chip that is cooled by the heatpipe with one tube of 3.5g Gelid GC extreme - really solid improvement. Just be aware that different screws have been used so take notes or pictures. Even when unscrewed the heatpipe does not come off easily you will need to apply some reasonable force. Before this process I ve only done some mods on desktops so this whole thing felt like a operation to me D When correctly done this should not remove your warranty in most countries afaik The air vents of the CPU GPU fan are blocked by what I call it AMD paper. Removing this paper will again decrease your temperatures by a lot. This will void your warranty so do it as you are comfortable with it or not. ASUS states this is to improve air flow to other mainboard components see youtube reviews but I call that bullshit. The exact same chassis has been used for a new Intel version of this notebook and guess what despite the exact same components the air intakes are not blocked. I did take a risk here because I feel this way the notebook has a chance to reach a respectable life span otherwise I think with those temperatures it will be case of warranty runs out and it destroys itself. There is a temperature sensor for the NVME present and the temperatures now are the same or even lower I did not make any notes for this unfortunately.,0.086,0.797,0.117,0.9741,1

gjiikh,ASUS,sorry not answering all of your post but 1 when you try to boot it s always go to the bios ? even in sata mode ? i think so from what you writted but i want to be sure. because you could boot on one of your devices with an error... in the doc of your motherboard i can see you can enable/disable SATA6 G1 to SATA6 G6 and then hotplug enable/disable for each sata port ? is this the same in your bios version ? Optane CSM must be disable CSM to disable save reboot go to bios . the you can see the new parameters to set UEFI to enable. in Boot devices control set to uefi only or uefi and legacy oprom If you know how to configure optane sorry else see video here the video is in english x200B 2 had you try to boot with your OS boot device alone ? could you pulg off other devices and boot with it alone ? hdd and optane off.. ? 3 did you update bios firmware 0805 to 2401 directly or had you used other firmware between ? if nothing else is ok at the end you could downgrade bios to older version if your bios allows it. perhaps you have to update with another version before. just wondering i could be wrong here for exemple Version 20012019/05/1510.31 MBytes PRIME Z370-A BIOS 2001 Updated IRST for the latest Intel processors to support Intel Optane memory. Please make sure to update RST driver to 17.2.6.1027 version or later for better compatibility. 4 the procedure i gave you was for the same issue but the last step was for a second issue you don t get. plus the procedure can t be the same because of motherboard/bios differences but could be helping by trying something close. so sorry because i had the same issue with my nvme boot device after a bios update and could fix it. i have to look in my bios parameters to help you further but i have no optane,0.052,0.853,0.095,0.9594,1

gj3k8t,ASUS,I don't have this particular model but I have a rog laptop and I'd suggest you stay far away from the brand. The quality of their products are questionable and customer support is a nightmare.,0.079,0.82,0.1,0.1901,1
gj3k8t,ASUS,Well it's a lottery. I got my Rog Strix g531gu on last week and i haven't any major problems so far. I also asked people on Reddit what they think about that laptop and some of them were really disappointed but also many of them said that it's quite good laptop. What i can tell you is that this laptop is good not terrible not nice just good. It does have some software problems but it's acceptable for that price. I would recommend you to buy it but you MUST check it before buying i mean turn it on in a store run some stress tests and if everything will be fine then take it. Good luck if you would buy this laptop i would like to hear your review so text me in direct if you want.,0.036,0.685,0.279,0.9897,1
gj3k8t,ASUS,I say go for the new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 if you want processing power that isn't only for productivity but ultra settings gaming as well. The thing is a beast and provides more than enough power for everyday tasks in a thin and light package as well as boasting a 10-hour battery life doing everyday tasks such as browsing which really is impressive for a mobile gaming solution. The new Ryzen 9 chip absolutely dominates any other mobile processer and it's packed with an RTX 2060 as well. The whole thing comes with a 1tb ssd and 16gb of ram for 1450 which is really solid. I believe the most impressive aspect of the laptop is its thermal solution which was so well thought out pretty rare for ASUS to be honest . Inside there is a dual heat sink with dual fans and ample vents on the side center and bottom. The ergonomic lift allows for greater airflow and a solid typing angle. The keyboard is fantastic although the backlighting is a bit uneven. Because of this design flaw I would go for the black model. The screen has a 120 hz refresh rate and a really even rgb gradient as well as solid nits in the brightness. Response time is a tab bit off but its barely noticeable and really solid for gaming manageable ghosting as well. Build quality is really good as well lots of thought and care went into a very sleek design. It outdoes previous ROG iterations 10 fold. I believe the only available buy link is on Best Buy but you might be in luck and find it in stock on the ASUS website.,0.0,0.736,0.264,0.9979,1

gj3k8t,ASUS,I personally have a rog and its 531gu .. i think its just differs in the ssd coz i have only 256gb. i wont say to stay away from this brand it performs really well for 3D MODELLING WITH REAL TIME RENDERING IN ARNOLD VIDEO EDITING FX in AFTER EFFECTS nuke or whatever and also FOR GAMING because I personally did all these and still doing it. regarding the brand i love it. with the price asus is providing better configuration. im not much concerned with the plastic. coz every brand is providing plastic only .plastic is plastic. . if you are concerned with the performance and spec go for rog. it gives awesome gaming spec. if you need better build quality than rog go for dell lenovo. but there you most probably have to compromise on gpu you wont get 1660 ti. 1660/1650/1060 otherwise you might have to pay more. or the processor might change from intel to amd it is not so bad thou . As far as i know laptops are compromised in spec and performance compared to PC because there is a need for limiting the heat. but if we really need a laptop we have to go for the laptop not the pc even if we get better configuration and performance. so regarding the fan sound. if you need less fan sound less heat compact size and incredible performance. its hard to get altogether. with the amount of money we have compromise on some. and these days quality of every brand is almost same even the alienware. some guy is already mentioned it in the comments. for the heating you can get an external laptop cooler fan . it'll help the laptop to cool faster. a little bit but it counts that too after the intense gaming is done dont expect it to be ice cool even during the gaming. external fan will help little with the air flow around the laptop. so finally if you have enough money go for this model because 1660ti is really awesome mobile gpu its far better than other 16 series and way better than 1060. and im not even gonna compare 1080 its legend in market. and new RTX graphics are way too overpriced. sorry for my bad english ,0.011,0.831,0.158,0.9961,1

Personally those things were more important to me then over all performance which is why I bought a g14. But I also had been looking at thin and lights with no dgpu as my next laptop before the g14 was announced. The only really comparable machine to the g14 is the razor blade stealth.

giujx9,ASUS,I have the same laptop. The Armoury Crate profiles are kind of messed up in how they approach power. Manual is broken. It just doesn't work so ignore it. Performance and Turbo deliver full power at all times with the latter ramping up the fan speed to a greater degree. Even if I manually set the minimum processor state to 5% done through the advanced power profile options in the Windows control panel in either profile the CPU never downclocks remaining in the 4.0-4.2 GHz range. In Silent mode the processor downclocks properly. There's a registry tweak for the power options that exposes a separate option to disable turbo boost all together so the CPU's maximum frequency will top out at 2.6 GHz. I did this for the Silent profile and it's been working out really well. It's my primary gaming profile since most of the games I'm playing are older and/or not particularly demanding. It should work well for Oblivion in your case and it's also surprisingly capable for newer releases. With the optimized silent profile the system can still average more than 90 fps in Forza Motorsport 7 with a minimum of about 75.

ghd2pi,ASUS,This may be too simple if so I apologize in advance. ☺ When the router shows the internet status as disconnected hook a wired device laptop with wired network port is good directly to the modem powered box between the router and cable that goes out of the house . If the wired device connects the router has issues if it does not connect most likely is your internet service provider has issues. One thing I do when I get the disconnected response is to check the modem status. Depends on model modem manuals are available for download typically that show what the lights mean but if the lights on the front of the modem are mostly off a problem with your provider is likely the issue. Also most modems have a reset button that can be pushed with a toothpick or paper clip. If the internet is disconnected resetting the modem sometimes helps.

ggova1,ASUS,Sorry you're dealing with this I've had to deal with it on a Strix Hero 2 GL504GM. Basically I had the laptop for a while and it worked but then the fans decided they're gonna be full blast for the rest of time. Sent it in and they replaced the motherboard which worked for a bit then it started doing whatever it wanted again. I have no solution because I built a new PC about a month ago. I know this is strange and doesn't make sense at all but I took the 2.5in hard drive out of my laptop and stuck it in my new PC and stuck the old m.2 back in the laptop so I could have the 1tb m.2 for my PC and now the fan runs silent. I can't explain it and honestly I don't care because I only rarely use my laptop now but figured I'd mention that it works properly with no 2.5 hdd in it. Good luck I might even just suggest returning the thing and getting something from Acer I know the predator Helios 300 has manual fan control as I had one before my Strix 2 but I returned the Helios because the thing literally could not cool itself and throttled every 3 seconds. I believe that to be an individual issue just like the fans on Asus laptops simply being luck of the draw.,0.087,0.795,0.118,0.8889,1

ggova1,ASUS,I feel your pain when I first bought my ROG SCAR 2 the fan noise didn't bother me as much because I was playing games all the time.

gh7ktd,ASUS,I just got an A15 a couple days ago. I only use it connected to my TV as an HTPC and for living room gaming so I can't comment much on its suitability as an everyday laptop. That said my impressions are I think the design looks nice and the build quality is pretty good. The keys and trackpad feel good to me. The screen is kinda washed out but considering the insane amount of CPU and GPU power you're getting at this price point it's hard to complain. It feels lightweight considering how big it is. The lid for the screen looks pretty classy and it opens with surprisingly little effort. The cooling solution is good. Temperatures stay low and nothing throttles. It could be quieter but you could say that about any gaming laptop probably. I've never owned a gaming laptop before but I've been reading a lot of reviews. Using it in Silent mode will often allow it to completely stop the fan and then it's obviously completely silent although when it does occasionally spin up it's kind of annoying. The minimum fan speed is 2200 RPM which is audible and it has kind of a whine to it. Depending on what you're doing the fan will also sometimes speed up and slow down and that's noticeable. I don't have much experience with Windows laptops so I don't know if this amount of noise is common. I think the bottom line is if you're looking for a laptop that's thin lightweight classy super-quiet and has a super-great screen get a MacBook. You're going to be pretty disappointed with this laptop. But the A15 is pretty inexpensive it has lots of RAM and fast storage it's upgradeable it has probably the best mobile CPU money can buy right now it has a strong GPU and it has a nice keyboard and trackpad. So there are pros and cons. I think the A15 is definitely a great value for sure though.,0.067,0.726,0.207,0.9949,1

gh3zxn,ASUS,You've replaced the SSD and the SATA data cables and verified the SATA power cables are working. If you've been tinkering with overclocking it would be a good idea to clear CMOS and see if the drive even the old one is detected in BIOS again. If not consider flashing BIOS again just to rule that out. If all of that still does not restore drive functionality you'll probably have to RMA the board. BTW It's a remote possibility but it could be that the old drive died and the new drive was DOA two dead drives.

ggxiez,ASUS,Install the drive you want as C under the heat sink first install Windows. It will be the boot drive going forward. Add the second M.2 later and it will be assigned D. You can always go in and change or re-assign things later and there are ways to know which is which from BIOS but it can be a bit daunting trying to figure it out. Motherboard manual will also tell you. I have found it is just simpler to do it as above install the drive you want to boot from under the heat sink and you are good to go.

ggxiez,ASUS,M.2 slots are connected differently on motherboard. The one between CPU and PCIe 16x is connected to CPU directly and the second M.2 slot is connected through Northbridge chip. If you got really high speed M.2 like 5000Mb/sec Sabrent drive you might get better speed with top M.2 slot than bottom M.2 slot. I can't find 100% verifiable and reliable source but it seems like some random testing I saw on Youtube reported about 5% speed difference between that 2 M.2 slots.,0.0,0.9,0.1,0.7469,1
ggxiez,ASUS,for those who read this in the future it turns out - it doesnt matter since the Corsair Force Series MP600 NVMe PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 I bought for it have their own heat sinks and so dont even fit unless you remove the heatsink that comes with the motherboard... this didnt even occur to me until i was installing them. the heatsink that came with the mobo is now in trashcan. Sidenote - the M.2s do not come with screws or little posts - they assume your motherboard provides those which this ASUS board did so I was fine but had a moment of panic when opening the Corsairs. In addition the answer i found is a little more complicated than I thought - the M.2 next to the CPU is listed and 1 but it is only PCIe 4.0 if you have a 3rd gen chip otherwise it is 3.0 - the M.2 with heatsink next to the northbridge chipset labeled 2 in the manual is 4.0 regardless of your CPU.

ggjlul,ASUS,Found this looking for a fix for my situation which is the similar. I have the AX89X and had it set up as a solo router for the house for about a week. I ordered two of the 86U routers to try and set them up as AiMesh nodes to help strengthen the signal at either ends of the house so the AX89U would be in the middle. Currently testing has only been to use one 86U at a time. The problem I’m experiencing is not with the initial set up. Link a node to the main router and devices connect to and I’m getting great speeds through the mesh. The 86U node router will at least once a day just say its offline. Pull the power cord and put it back in a boom back to working again. Or if I have a device connected to the node and everything is working good and I put it down to take the dog for a walk when I come back I have a connection to the node router but no internet connection. Some time toggling the devices wifi off and back on will fix the internet connection. Some times it requires restarting the router even through it doesn’t show as being offline to fix it. Seems most times it is some but not all devices connected to the node that are having a problem. Last night I was watching a movie on my iPad which was connected to the node and half way through I had just lost my connection and had to toggle wifi on and off to get the connection back. So while at first I thought it was it just couldn’t make the reconnection after sleeping I am having an issue with an active connection. There shouldn’t need to be this much restarting toggling powering off to get the mesh to work. This set up is replacing the two Apple Airport Extremes I’ve been using for years.,0.044,0.92,0.036,-0.3818,-1

ggjkdp,ASUS,I have this same laptop purchased for 1 300 when Best Buy had it as one of its daily deals a couple weeks ago. Out of the box the Armoury Crate software was saying one of its components needed an update. It would download and install but the update notification would still come back. It wasn't really affecting anything so I left it alone. I tried to undervolt using ThrottleStop but my settings were too aggressive causing an endless BSOD boot loop. Tried using the built-in recovery partition but it got stuck in the middle. I ended up wiping the drive completely and starting over with a bootable USB. After some initial trouble getting Armoury Crate and the SSD cache set up properly it's been working fine - for the most part. I love the feel of the keyboard the hardware packs a punch and I can achieve 4-5 hours of battery life in Silent mode doing basic tasks without an undervolt which is great for a laptop with a high-power six-core CPU. Haven't done a ton of gaming yet but in Performance mode it has no problems maintaining a solid 144 fps in Doom 2016 at a mix of high and ultra settings. Temps seem to stabilize in the 70-75 range when the fans ramp up which can get a bit loud but this is a characteristic you have to expect from a thin and light gaming laptop. The screen is amazing. You can charge it via USB-C which can be handy if you need a bit of extra juice in a pinch. The fact that it comes with a 1 TB SSD out of the box is nice and you can add more via a second M.2 slot. Note that the standard 16 GB of RAM is soldered to the motherboard and runs only in single-channel mode. I would recommend ponying up another 60- 70 on a second 16 GB stick to put in the free available slot as you'll see a noticeable bump in CPU performance by moving to dual channel. The only thing about the physical design that I really find negative is the fact that the WiFi card is also soldered to the motherboard. At least it's an Intel 9560 which is an excellent unit but moving up to WiFi 6 later is out of the question unless you get an external dongle. Their decision to do this on the GU502GV is even more baffling when you consider that you can upgrade the WiFi hardware in the cheaper GA502DU which has a virtually identical form factor. Overall I'm satisfied with it. At its current sale price of 1 450 as of this writing I think it's a bit overpriced but if it comes back down to 1 300 again I would say it's worth it.,0.064,0.842,0.094,0.949,1

ggdrme,ASUS,I have the same constant issues with my RGB lighting running a Crosshair VIII but I have a ROG Thor PSU G.Skill Trident Z Neo memory AMD Wraith CPU cooler and a Strix 2080 Super without the keyboard and mouse. Lighting profile not sinking on startup so I actually have to go into Armoury Crate to get the correct RGB to kick in. Then the MB not being recognized in armoury crate when I do but the RGB changes. I tried deleting armoury crate to try and fix the issues but it seems there is a bug and it doesn’t get deleted all the way. So when you try to reinstall armoury crate it does not install all the way. No matter what I tried I could not get it to reinstall. I literally had to reinstall windows to get armoury crate back on my system. So now I want to try to avoid uninstalling armoury crate. From the icue comment I actually think the icue software makes the issues worse because icue and aura are fighting over control of the MB plus icue only recognizes your MB and none of you other Asus parts so what’s the point. I only have a Corsair K70 LUX so I just ended up deleting the icue altogether. Unfortunately I still was having problems so I reinstalled windows again and did not install icue on the fresh copy. Now I am actually thinking of getting a different keyboard so I can actually use the lighting and set macros. I was actually thinking of getting an aura sync keyboard and mouse so I can make it easy and just use one program to control all the RGB lighting. After reading your comments though it looks like you still have to use two different programs to control all your stuff with the Scope and the Spartha plus having issues on top of that. So I will be staying away from buying a ROG mouse and keyboard and just go another direction. It’s shitty because there really isn’t much better out there then Corsair keyboards. Bottom line I love the build quality of all of my ROG products but having the constant software issues is just more and more disappointing because it seems like I spend more time trying to get them to work correctly over actually using them. Has me thinking twice about using them in future builds. I know it may be too much to ask but I would really really just like to have one program to control everything. All the lighting mouse profiles keyboard profiles...and actually have all of it work. You are also super right about the shutdown white LED’s on the motherboard and the two on the graphics card they could light up a runway which is completely unnecessary. Plus the only way to turn them off is by shutting off the power supply.,0.059,0.857,0.084,0.9157,1

gg2xw7,ASUS,For one thing you are best off buying a kit of 2 sticks of DDR so a 2x8GB kit if you want 16GB as the sticks are likely to be better matched that way. Second thing is 32gb kits are less likely to overclock well due to them having dual rank chips. Third is that a 3200 rated kit will have been tested at that speed on intel and is less likely to run stable at that speed on AMD. So if you want it to run 3200 buy a 3400 kit.

I already sent the card to RMA as it also had some memory issues but I included this problem as well but nothing came out of it. Though many others on the internet seem to have the same problem and you can easily find examples of this from even 2017! Edit I should also mention that I‘ve once had the GPU running with the fans on both FanConnect II headers so each fan got it’s own header but the same thing occurred. Sometimes even both fans don‘t work which results into overheating problems.,0.064,0.85,0.086,-0.1323,-1

gfd3r0,ASUS,So about two years ago I bought a vg278 144hz tn monitor within 2 months the infamous fully white screen of death happened to me. Because of life being busy at the time I wasn't able to rma it at and eventually just assumed the monitor was out of warranty. So I switched back to my old cheapo monitor and used it for 2 years while my asus vg278 sat IN THE BOX AND PACKAGED for 2 years. When I discovered that asus offers a 3 year warranty I hurried to send it in for rma. Now this is where things get interesting. That monitor didn't have a single scratch ding or dent when I sent it in due to it being in my closet packed and untouched for 2 years. I know I didn't scratch it within the 2 months I used it. Now they're refusing to fix my monitor over this scratch. The thing that infuriates me the most is that 1. The scratch isn't from me I'm guessing its from shipping even though the monitor was packed good. 2. The white screen of death is a known issue with the monitors and is NOT caused by a scratch anyway. So even if I did scratch the monitor the scratch isn't deep enough to cause any damage much less the white screen of death. What should I do now? How do I fight something like this? Theyre now asking that I pay MORE to get it fixed than I did when I bought it.,0.101,0.867,0.032,-0.9549,-1

gebiq3,ASUS,Ive been having the same problem awhile now. I think its caused by the cpu thermal throttling as there are pieces of paper at the bottom air intake for absolutely no reason.

IMO if u can return the laptop then return it but it would be a massive headache knowing how asus support is...

gduior,ASUS,have you previously used like a gaming laptop because these are heavy and not like ultrabook. Its just my opinion that ultrabook would be better because they are not bulky and closed whereas gaming are always a lil heavy and would have areas exposed due to heat flow. So but i think your priority is gaming so either buy a console or wait for ps5 or if you are going for this laptop i would suggest don't carry it around like a ultrabook.

gduior,ASUS,Hi there thanks so much for reaching out to our team and we're happy to advise. Unfortunately the standard ASUS warranty doesn't cover physical damages therefore the warranty would've been voided. However it all depends on the unit and the coverage it comes with. You could send us your unit's serial number via private message so that we can advise you if the unit comes with ADP Accidental Damage Protection which can only be utilized once throughout the 1 year warranty. Your serial number can be found at the bottom of the unit right above the barcode it is listed as S/N or SSN.,0.06,0.82,0.119,0.6975,1
gduior,ASUS,if you spill water on it in the US you might as well just buy a new one without accidental damage warranty. the repair center won't repair only replace which means about 90% of MSRP quote and you only get a refurbished unit and not a new one. other non water damages that don't touch mainboard would probably be 300-500,0.047,0.857,0.096,0.2617,1

gdnsf9,ASUS,One major thing that irritates me about PC usage is keeping drivers up-to-date. But honestly I wouldn't depend on a application to keep all my drivers current.

gcoqy4,ASUS,I have the TUF505 laptop with the same GTX 1660Ti GPU 16GB ram but a Ryzen 7 chip. So I can't say from experience but I heard that the Ryzen 7 chips perform better than Intel chips. I also noticed this laptop only has a 512GB SSD. In my opinion that's not a lot of space and you will likely be doing a lot of uninstalling and moving things around to try to make space for games. I have a 256GB SSD and 1TB HDD and I am STILL frequently moving things off my HDD to an external drive to make space. The 17 screen is nice. I wish I had 17 unfortunately some jackass thought a 15 would be just fine for a TUF laptop but it's not a deal breaker.,0.053,0.843,0.104,0.7579,1
gcoqy4,ASUS,I have the version with i7 !The only thing I would recommen you is to buy 16 gb of ram if it doesn't have already!Otherwise is a very powerfull laptop very good for gaming!I don't regret buying it!,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.7713,1
gcoqy4,ASUS,I bought 2 of this exact laptop one for me and one for my wife. We love them! We aren't super techy so take my advice as a casual user. They run cool for us. Even heavy gaming the fans ramp up well but not very loud at all. The screen looks great the machine seems plenty fast to me feels solid built. I haven't had any issues. Had them for 4 months or so. I researched a while before buying. Not disappointed.,0.023,0.769,0.208,0.936,1
gcoqy4,ASUS,I have this laptop but if you are going to get it upgrade it's RAM from 8GB to 16GB. It underperforms in games with only 8GB but gets double the FPS once you upgrade it.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

gcoqy4,ASUS,I had a very similar model ROG Strix it was very good and ran most games well. However after a year or 2 i started having some circuit issues because it got quite hot.

gcoqy4,ASUS,It looks similar to the zephyrs M GU502 I have with the 9850 ? but without the 2060. It’s capable to game on. I used the hdmi out to my desktop monitor with keyboard and mouse and then put it up like a tent so the vents are pointing out and I didn’t have an overheating problem on turbo mode. What I would do is get a laptop cooler if you’re not going to use an external monitor.,0.046,0.868,0.086,0.4767,1
gcoqy4,ASUS,I would recommend taking a look at some of the new ryzen 4000 series gaming laptops since they have better performance than all of Intel's current mobile parts at a lower power consumption and significantly less heat. Most of those laptops you can even use on battery not gaming for 8 hours too which means you can actually use it for school and work too.,0.034,0.884,0.082,0.4939,1

gd2okx,ASUS,Hi Destroyer10super thanks for reaching out to our team. We do apologize for any inconvenience and we'll be more than happy to assist. Was this issue always present or did it recently develop? Also were there any software or hardware changes around the time this issue started? We'd recommend that you factory reset your device. However before doing that reset Be sure that your device has at least %50 charge life and Logout from your Google Account to remove the FRP Lock. Also just to be advised your data will be wiped. Any information that's not backed you will not be able to retrieve. - Power off your device and wait a few seconds. - Press and hold Volume Up Power buttons together until recovery mode screen appears. These button combinations can change on different modals. - When you see the Asus logo release the Power button but keep holding Volume Up until the recovery mode screen comes. - Leave all the buttons when Recovery Mode screen appears. - Go to Wipe Data/Factory Reset option using Volume Down and press Power button to confirm it. - Go to Yes –Delete All User Data using Volume Down and press Power button to continue. - After the process finishes go to Reboot System Now and press Power button.,0.019,0.915,0.066,0.8505,1
gcwiys,ASUS,On the zenbook pro duo Windows sees the monitor as just another secondary monitor rather than as one giant screen so you can disconnect/disable it like as if you had a monitor connected externally. There's even a shortcut key on the keyboard to disable the secondary screen. I imagine the zephyrus will be similar. There's also a fan intake or exhaust not sure which under the screen so it'll be interesting to see how temps are if running it with the screen closed and docked to external monitors,0.046,0.869,0.085,0.5576,1

gcon8s,ASUS,Well everyone always has a nagging doubt about their choice after they’ve bought anything! For me I don’t do any note taking etc so the pen and touch screen was worthless. In any case there seems to be no palm rejection as it’s not an active pen so you’re gonna have to write with your hand hovering above the screen! I use mine with graphic design and photo editing apps Affinity Suite and on these apps I can place all the panels on the small screen and have all the content on the bigger screen. This effectively gives me far more space than any other small laptop so that’s pretty neat. I would have liked to get the pro version but I didn’t want to carry around something the size of a paving slab with a 3 -4 hr battery life not to mention that it would have cost almost double for the i7 model let alone the i9!

gbqzt4,ASUS,Congrats man! I recently bought a very similar system. Z390 MOBO as people recommended in here with the i9-9900KF CPU. Same Graphics card CPU cooler and PSU but the 1000W version . Runs really smooth. I'm pretty sure there is a built in WIFI module in the Z390 motherboard so maybe you don't need that as an extra unit. From what I've read about the 10th gen CPU's coming out in a few months there is no real big difference in gaming performance between the 9th gen and 10th gen so you should be more than good man. You can always save a couple of hundred dollars or get 5% extra performance for the same price if you just wait a liiitle longer. Who cares if you need it now Enjoy,0.019,0.787,0.194,0.979,1
gbqzt4,ASUS,Did someone put that together for you? The two-fan corsair AIO is shit. There are fan coolers that have higher TDP potential and are cheaper.

gbiu5m,ASUS,Switching the disk interface to AHCI from IDE or RAID changed the way your computer interfaces your storage devices with your operating system. Likely what happened was that Windows was still expecting your disks to be connected to the IDE/RAID controller and tried to communicate with them but was failing. Somewhere along that chain of reboots it installed the drivers for the AHCI controller and was able to boot again. To answer your question no it's unlikely that setting a BIOS password had anything to do with preventing Windows to boot. Although I highly recommend against setting a BIOS password unless you know what you're doing as it adds needless complication for barely any security gain whatsoever.,0.066,0.851,0.083,0.4899,1

gba2zq,ASUS,That link you posted is specifically for M.2 SSDs. If that’s the storage you have then you can physically remove the M.2 from the dead machine and like you said use it like a USB drive to access the data. If you have a SATA SSD you will need a similar device that’s for SATA interface not M.2. I have personally used similar devices for SATA and IDE hard drives to recover data they work well.,0.071,0.84,0.089,0.1027,1
gb8x6w,ASUS,Product Link Hi I need to find a laptop that is under 400 has enough specs to run remote office programs during Corona can last for years able to handle 12 hours a day office workload and potential capability for 2 monitor screen hookup option down the road. If you could recommend me a laptop that fits our criteria I'd really appreciate it. Thank you,0.0,0.873,0.127,0.8051,1

gb8kjy,ASUS,The screen is lackluster if you need to do some photo/video color grading. At least according to reviewers and considering they edit videos for a living that's a valuable spec to them hence their harshness on displays/color accuracy. I think I saw a few reviews saying the response time was pretty slow so if you need top notch response time for FPS games to hit Master in competitive you'll probably dislike this display. Thermals seem to be average compared to other mid-range gaming laptops. Nothing stands out good or bad which I think is fine. From what I've seen the Strix comes with single channel 8GB 2666MHz RAM. Not sure how that effects the Intel processors unit but the A15 comes with dual channel 16GB 3200MHz. Another spec to consider might be battery. The A15 has 90Whr and the Strix 66Whr. If you plan to use your laptop for browsing/working for a while the A15 might last a bit longer unplugged. Personally I went with the A17 the 17in version . Would have gone A15 but saw that the 17in was in stock. I know I'm going to be disappointed with the display because I really love responsive screens but the value for the 4800H battery size and the RAM config made it worth it. I don't think I can wait any longer for the 4000 series as Lenovo upped their base 4600H Legion 5 model from 760 to more than 1k. If you don't need the laptop now do as others are and wait it out for the next 2-3 months.,0.042,0.869,0.088,0.9057,1
gb4e9x,ASUS,Same thing happened on my x570 tuf gaming plus. Nothing but problems with these asus mobos. Problem after problem after problem. There should be a class action lawsuit against these defective motherboards. Seems like everyone and their brothers are having issues of one sort or another on the Asus x570 lineup.,0.255,0.652,0.093,-0.8937,-1
gb4e9x,ASUS,Yep seems that this is the case. I have the same motherboard x570-E and I have been searching for answers to this particular issue since the ROG Strix logo stays lit on shutdown. There is no way to configure the shutdown effects anymore or at least turn them off. This happens despite the fact that I have set Stealth Mode under shutdown on onboard devices configuration in BIOS. I guess that we have to wait for an update or something.,0.044,0.928,0.028,-0.0772,-1
gb7a80,ASUS,I had this happen to me the first day with my Scar 3 it died and I sent it back to Amazon to be replaced. You're gonna need to RMA. I'm learning these laptops are extremely prone to breaking.,0.092,0.865,0.043,-0.4404,-1
gavtqc,ASUS,The 502DU is a decent option as long as you can get it for less than 1 000. I got one when it was 900 a couple weeks ago. The keyboard was one of the best I've ever used and I've owned plenty of laptops. Out of the box the Performance and Turbo modes in Armoury Crate set the CPU to 100% performance at all times which caused idle temperatures to hover in the 55-60 degree range. Setting the minimum to 5% while plugged in or on battery dropped those readings to a far more manageable 38-43. I disabled turbo boost on mine as I didn't encounter a situation where I felt it was necessary. The newest game I tried to play on it was Doom 2016 and with the Vulkan API it had no problems maintaining a 100 fps average at 1080p and high settings. The stock WiFi card was horrendous but that was easy enough to swap for an Intel AX200. You could even go with an Intel 9560 if you wanted to save a few bucks - I've seen it as low as 10- 13 online. nbsp All this said I'm going to be swapping out this system for the GU502GV since Best Buy put it on sale for 1 300 as one of its daily deals and the store nearest me has it in stock. The better specifications 6-core CPU RTX GPU 1 TB SSD 144 Hz screen RGB keyboard are worth that much of a price premium.,0.04,0.859,0.101,0.9581,1
gavtqc,ASUS,I just wanna point out something for others if they had or are having the same problem I did. I agree with a lot of what OP says but the unit I got had a major problem with thermal throttling. Tried to play Star Wars BF2 2017 and The Outer Worlds and it took just a couple minutes for it to reach max temp on the cpu where it dropped to about 400MHZ. Frame rate drop usually 8-15 and audio distortion. Took me hours to find a common fix. Update the BIOS to 300. It has been working great ever since. Also how did you take off the vent blockers? I saw them when I added another SSD but I wasn't sure how to go about taking it off. Just take a guitar pick or something and it'll just pry off?,0.107,0.814,0.079,-0.6253,-1

gb36ps,ASUS,1. I've got an Asus Prime x 570 P and in my bios there's a quick key to change aura settings f4 i think? and in there they have a few settings and one of them is to shut it off. I'd imagine other Aura-enabled boards have similar settings. You can still use in-os software like armory crate or etc to turn it on or off while in the os though if you want. If you just wanted to get rid of it completely you could just not plug in the rgb headers for stuff like fans and etc... suppose that might not work for stuff like motherboard lights and ram though. 2. Aura does allow for some selecting of devices such as mobo ram and individual headers. if you chain all your fans together and put them on one header they control as one device in my experience but i haven't tried to change that so maybe there's a way but i doubt it. 3. no idea - haven't tried and aura is so finicky that now that i have it in a workable setup i'm not going to tinker with it too much.,0.032,0.927,0.041,-0.296,-1

gafyca,ASUS,TUF is the better option even as an ROG fan . Display has a higher refresh rate and you get the Ryzen CPU. Both are solid laptops. If you're looking for aesthetics go with the ROG though.

gafyca,ASUS,The ryzen is better in every way man. the cpu is simply MORE POWERFUL than the equivalent of intel. and thanks to the new CEO Lisa they are designing great chips now that dont burn your lap and have amazing performance! also i noticed you mention about being told ROG TUF. whoever is telling you that you can go back to them and tell them to get educated... because you should never put a brand name before the product itself. Seriously this is a no brainer Ryzen all the way in this choice. the ryzen cpu has nearly double the cores is 100mhz faster i know its very little almost nothing has better L2 AND L3 cache.,0.03,0.806,0.165,0.9615,1

gafyca,ASUS,My friend has the ROG one it has good cooling and good colors on the screen i have TUF with GTX 1060 and its better than the ROG since GTX 1650 is weaker than GTX 1060.

gafyca,ASUS,I'm definitely a ROG guy but in this case the TUF is the clear winner. If it's possible for you to save about 300 more you could go for a Asus Zephyrus G14. That's a Ryzen9 with an RTX2060.,0.0,0.684,0.316,0.9408,1

gafyca,ASUS,Edit after looking up these models they both appear to only be available outside the US I found the listing primarily in Vietnam and Thailand . Based on that information my original post doesn't really work. But after some google searching I found what appears to be the Xgear website which is in Vietnam and it shows the TUF model actually being 50US equivalent cheaper. Original At that price don't get either assuming these are USD in the US market . There are better options at around that price if you can wait... the TUF506IU-ES74 is generally sold out at MSRP except XoticPC if you trust them for 999 you get the 4800H and a GTX 1660 Ti... if you can find it. Also if you want to get one from a bigger retailer like Newegg there is the MSI Bravo 15 with a 4800H and AMD 5500M GPU... the GPU is not as good as 1660 but should be better than the 1650's. If you can wait you should wait for one of the better models to be in stock. I checked Best Buy everyday for 2 weeks but was eventually able to order the model I wanted.,0.008,0.875,0.116,0.9643,1

Media consumption writing taskmanagement and so on. The whole MacOS user experience and a set of app that have no equivalent on any other OS. After a day on Windows it always feels like an escape. Hate the keyboard so i use an external Magic Keyboard. During the last 10 years i bought a few high-end Windows laptop Dell Vaio Toshiba to see if i can get a feel for it and have a more mobile lifestyle. It never satisfies me and quickly decide i cant work on it..i have about 10k worth of machines collecting dust around the house. Last year i bought a Thinkpad Carbon X1. The weight and the keyboard and the good deal made me pull the trigger. I must say for the first time i really enjoy working on a Windows laptop. It's so light sturdy fast and the keyboard.... unfortunately it doesnt give me the MacOS ecosystem but other than that its a delight to work on.

gqtwe1,thinkpad,There's no reason that you should be afraid to brick your computer just because you install another OS onto it. Linux runs well on most Thinkpads.

gqtwe1,thinkpad,My T440s works perfectly with Linux one issue with trackpad - see below . It's a very similar machine to yours so I would imagine that should also be fine.

gqtwe1,thinkpad,I wouldn't worry about bricking your computer simply by installing Linux. You're basically only writing data to your hard drive this way and not much can go wrong with that.

I just DD an image from one linux machine to another. The older ones with Classic Keyboards and no dGPU need tweaks but you can't brick your laptop just by installing an OS. You can make it temporarily non-bootable but there's nothing you can do that would prevent reinstall of Windows or Linux. I recommend getting a USB drive or second SSD/HDD and boot a LiveOS version of something like Ubuntu Pop!OS or MX. There are plenty of HowTos to guide you.

gqrh7c,thinkpad,In terms of performance the T480 has all the other machines you've listed beat. As for it being sluggish that really depends on what you intend to use it for. I wouldn't really bother with the L and E series if you've got a T series budget. As for the 7490 it's built well and has a better panel than the stock FHD panel on the T480 but yes the 7490 and it's successor the 7400 do run hot. The T480 still has the edge in terms of performance that one notebookcheck review with the T480 and the i7 8650U has some strange numbers .,0.038,0.858,0.104,0.7164,1
gqrh7c,thinkpad,If you'd like something fast for a limited budget go AMD - they're faster and cheaper than Intel offerings. As for the build quality current day E series is decent and L series is now practically on par with T series so don't be too afraid to prioritize performance. Considering that you're willing to be far from picky I vote for E495 with the best spec Ryzen you can obtain for it as I don't know your budget from my personal experience even budget ThinkPads of the past were pretty heckin' solid so you won't be losing much in this department by buying a current day E series.

gpy637,thinkpad,As a fun weekend project I tried to get as much of Windows 98 SE working on my ThinkPad T60 as I could. The laptop officially only supports Windows XP and later and a lot of things like network access couldn't work. That said I did find a generic VGA driver capable of driving higher resolutions and colors and a USB 2.0 driver that let me transfer files off and on albeit unreliably . I was able to install Office 97 and Photoshop 5.5 and get some real offline work done! Tried to play games as well some like Midtown Madness 2 worked great others like NFS 2 SE and DOOM worked but in 256 color mode which is messed up in this generic driver. I wish there were a driver for the ATi X1400 for Win9x but I wasn't able to find any. Overall it was pretty fun one-time experience!

You should not let yourself be blinded by the keyboard look at everything else these three models have to offer and make a decision based on that instead. x220 will probably be cheapest and actually quite fast for the money with average to below average battery life . x250 can be a bit sluggish depending on what processor you end up with but good battery life and nice screen options out of the box but also very sucky ones .

gqixxj,thinkpad,Is the x250 a quality machine compared to the x220? Any handicaps that should be noted? I have both well it's a x230 . The x230 feel sturdier than the x250 but that's also because the x250 is thinner which is probably what's giving me that impression. There's been some threads here that said the x250/x260 suffers from bad internals eg. the RAM module shifts when the laptop is held on one end but I have not experienced this. x200B Is the KB horrendous or meh or good for a modern KB? As I'm going to be a student soon it's fairly important. It has a nice travel to it so it still feels tactile which is great for typing. I recently measured the key size for another poster compared x250 vs x230 chicklet KB . The size of the lettenumber keys are the same but the other keys are smaller. The spacing is also a little off. From Q to P the x250 KB was shorter by about 0.5inch. If you're only using the x250 you'll get used to it.

gqixxj,thinkpad,X250 or a T450s is what I would recommend not the 2nd gen x1 carbon Lenovo kinda sh t the bed with its keyboard layout for that generation . The keyboard will be a change from the x220 mostly just slicker keys and a bit less efficient layout. Personally got used to it and don't mind as much anymore better than most other brands keyboards still. Just make sure to look for a fhd panel as otherwise you will get less than great tn panels.

Well I had a T440s as my main machine which is basically the same sans TrackPoint buttons . What I loved about this one is that design wise it is very similar to the regular T series – non-wedge design straight edges boxy look. That makes it unique among the newer T4xxs since the T460s switched to an X1 Carbon inspired wedge-design. It just oozes that classic ThinkPad feeling more but unlike the regular T450 it has much better materials Magnesium base cover instead of plastic and it also has smaller bezels so it is more compact. It also retains the Powerbridge which was certainly nice to have in the pre-USB-C era. T440s and T450s along with the T440p also were the first T ThinkPads since the T60 to feature an IPS screen.

gqgoaw,thinkpad,I made the switch from a Surface Book to my current X1C5 a few years ago. The primary reason for the switch was the fact that I simply can't live with Windows and Thinkpad's generally have great Linux support but to sum it all up The Thinkpad comes out on top as the better laptop by far in my opinion. The Surface Book is cool but unless you really need the detachable tablet as a feature I don't see a sensible reason to buy one. The Thinkpad wins in the following areas for me - Better keyboard - Trackpoint - More durable - More servicable - Linux support - Much better IO - Much faster SSDs - Better WiFi Intel - Native ethernet - Integrated WWAN I use it so much! - Matte display - Lighter smaller and the hinge is far better. Stiff no wobble and can rotate a full 180 degrees. x200B The Surface Book has a few things going for it though especially if you use your computer for media consumption primarily. - 3 2 aspect ratio - Better speakers - Detachable tablet and great pen support - dGPU optional in the base x200B The only thing I miss about the Surface Book was the fact that the design was so unique and the tactile feeling of detaching the screen even if the awesome click sound is artificial was so satisfying. In the end though the Thinkpad is much more comfortable to use as a pure laptop. I feel Lenovo has pretty much perfected the conventional laptop at this point and I don't really understand why people go for XPS's and Macbooks that give you 2 USB-C ports and a headphone jack and that's it.,0.015,0.738,0.247,0.9975,1

gqer65,thinkpad,'Decade long' is going to be pretty much impossible to predict. You can google what 10 year old machines are still in use today but they are unlikely to live for another 10 however if you want to you can replace every dying component one at a time as long as you can find replacements making it at least a theoretical possibility . We have no idea how current machines will age we will know in 10 years but thats not really useful now. Modern machines will not allow component replacements like the old ones did so as long as you keep throwing new motherboards at a laptop you could probably make a modern thinkpad last 10 years but i dont think thats what you are after here. Going for a decent workstation and buying all the extended warranty you can will probably give you the most long lasting experience.

gqe0ur,thinkpad,Lenovo uses multiple suppliers for most parts which means that the performance of a particular part be it display keyboard trackpad top lid SSD whatever varies more from manufacturer to manufacturer than model to model.

gqe0ur,thinkpad,Key travel differs in different series. The T480s for instance has 0.2mm less travel than the T480 by design. I would assume the new T490 which is of same shape factor as the T480s and as such much thinner than the T480 to have the same limited key travel. The P50 on the other hand being a full workstation would have a longer key travel same as my T460p which clearly has longer than both the T480 and the T480s.,0.023,0.905,0.072,0.6124,1

The t460p also has a dgu and the t480 seems to not have one. I personally use a t480s with the 8250U wich also us a quadcore and 16 gb DDR4 RAM.

gqcqs3,thinkpad,The T470s has a dual core cpu so it will perform a lot worse than the other options so you can eliminate that immediately unless you're looking for thin and light. I would go for the T480 and I have a T460p. Both machines are roughly in the same CPU performance class although the T460p is a little faster. The T460p also has better graphics and a better screen but this comes at the expense of battery life. It only has the external battery vs internal and external on the T480 and on top of that it uses more power because of the H series cpu and dedicated GPU. Do not expect it to make it through a day on a charge even with the extended battery. Also the T480 is thinner lighter and it has a thunderbolt port. The combination of weight thickness battery life and thunderbolt would push me to the T480 but YMMV.,0.013,0.92,0.066,0.7935,1
gqcqs3,thinkpad,Get the T480. I have the T480s with the i5 8250 and the T460p same as listed NVMe and I can barely tell the difference in performance and only when there are sustained loads rendering video . The T480 will also have ask warranty left that can be extended further the T460p even with extended like mine will expire next year.

gqcbun,thinkpad,If you're going to be doing design with your laptop make sure its screen covers at least 90-95% of sRGB that's not the only factor that matters but from what I can tell screens with good sRGB coverage tend to generally be good . Oh and if there would be an OLED screen as an option I can guarantee that this specific type of display is not future-proof by design as it would gather burn-ins from sheer usage so I'd avoid it. X1 Extreme won't be much more compact than your Nitro 5 as both are 15 inch laptops. Maybe X1 Extreme would be somewhat thinner. Yet it should handle your tasks just fine. Anything more compact however won't be as future-proof as X1 Extreme as they'd be using weaker ULV processors and will most likely lack discrete GPUs which will also negatively impact video rendering times .,0.065,0.84,0.095,0.3949,1

gqcbcu,thinkpad,Most if not all SD card readers in thinkpads are PCI based not USB. As such you can not boot from them.

I’m just gonna paste it here because i can’t find the link anymore i had this text saved How To Install Ubuntu To A USB Drive Insert the Ubuntu Live CD/DVD switch on the computer and tell it to boot from CD/DVD using your 'BIOS'. It will take a couple of minutes to load and you will be presented with two choices. 'Try Ubuntu' or 'Install Ubuntu' you should select 'Install Ubuntu' You will then be presented with a number of options. You need to select the bottom option 'Something Else'. This will bring you to the partitioning menu. Your Primary hard drive will be listed as 'Sda' followed by any partitions that are on it like Sda1 or Sda2. Below this will be your usb drive it will be listed as 'Sdb'. Click on 'Sdb1' which is the only partition on the drive and select 'change'. You need to select 'use this partition as Ext4 File System' some distributions such as Mint reqiure you to manually select 'format' at this point . Then you need to set the 'mount point' as '/' which is the root file system and click OK. You will be taken back to the previous menu and that partition will have a tick next to it. Now click on 'Sdb' just above that partition this selects it as the device to install to. Now just below is an option for where the bootloader is to be installed. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you CHANGE THIS OPTION. THE BOOTLOADER MUST BE INSTALLED TO YOUR DEVICE listed as '/dev/Sdb'. If you do not do this the bootloader will be installed to your internal drive. You are now ready to install to your external device simply click 'Install'. You will need to answer a few simple questions like 'name' and 'create password' then you can sit back and relax.,0.004,0.916,0.08,0.9698,1

gqb1ih,thinkpad,I'm assuming by good modern kernel you actually mean a good modern Linux distribution ? With Linux there are so many choices and what distribution you prefer depends on your preference. Ubuntu and it's derivatives are a safe bet but I'd argue Fedora strikes a better balance between bleeding edge software and stability and provides the best Gnome Desktop experience out of the box. Furthermore you get SELinux built in which is one of the few significant security mechanisms available for Linux today. I also generally just prefer Fedora's way of doing things and I find that they generally favor technologies that I prefer also. Of course Arch Linux will always be a great alternative if you want to live on the edge but you will have to live with the occasional breakage which can almost always be easily fixed . x200B In the end though there are so many Linux distro's out there that you really should just experiment and figure out which one appeals to you.

gq5dox,thinkpad,Hello! What is maximum T450 supported RAM DDR3L frequency? You can use a program called HWiNFO to see what it supports for RAM speeds. I'd suggest going with G.Skill but if you don't mind a gamble HyperX might work. As far as i know some of Thinkpads like T430 or T440p can handle 2133MHz higher then official spec. Yup that's accurate except the T430 would require an Ivy-Bridge CPU to be installed. Some of them shipped with Sandy-Bridge chips which can always be swapped out for IB but my guess is it would limit the speeds to 1333 1600MHz could be wrong though no SB chip handy to test with .

gpx2h2,thinkpad,I hate the position of Ctrl key though hopefully I will get used to it. There is a BIOS option to swap the Fn/Ctrl keys forgot the exact wording but just dig around and it should be obvious . As for the throttling it is supposed to be fixed in Linux in the recent firmware updates but I've still seen mixed results with it sometimes can hit 90C but sometimes throttles around 65C . It is supposed to do some kind of lap/desk detection and only allow higher temps on a desk but I still see throttling sometimes even when it is perfectly flat and still on a desk. You can easily work around this by installing throttled however.,0.019,0.873,0.108,0.8945,1
gpx2h2,thinkpad,welcome in the Thinkpad world! For Aorus yeah I have the 1080 it's not working pretty well two things - TB3 bandwidth is totally used by the graphic card so even a mouse will have lag when using your GPU. - it's better to plug in when it's already booted up. And there is no switch on/off for power cycle the gaming box when it's stuck in sleep mode. To solve those issues I have the basic usb-c dock for power supply and usb stuffs and the power button!! and the Aorus for gpu. Two TB3 cable. Ps try amazon.es/de it ship to France sometimes they do have gaming box. You will need patience.

gpx2h2,thinkpad,it doesn't hurt the battery that much The resolution you select does not matter for the battery life because you the display still uses the same amount of physical pixels. The only difference might come from a difference in the GPU power consumption and that is usually negligible. But Lenovo why not putting one of them on the right side I believe this is because they are controlled by the same controller on the motherboard so they have to be close to each other.,0.013,0.954,0.033,0.4023,1

gq18l4,thinkpad,The E series is built with a lesser quality than the T series. It is still built very well. Some IO and specifics may vary. x200B An IPS screen is a much better quality screen with better color contrast and brightness. More info in the sidebar x200B WWAN is basically the ability to install a SIM card to have data on the go. Most machines have the slot but only some have the card to use it. If you find yourself working off of your phone's hotspot a lot and can afford another data line on your phone plan it may be worthwhile. x200B A Thinkpad will never be the best for gaming but if you truly want one I would go with the Ryzen 7 if you can afford it.

gpwfhg,thinkpad,It can absolutely be usable again even just with a new SSD. Probably like 40-60 depending on storage if you go for something low end. More expensive ones are faster and more reliable but you won't really benefit from either doing simple tasks on an older machine. As others have said you could upgrade the ram as well but that'll depend how much you'll use it and how long you'll keep using it for. that probably won't give you the same level of benefit as the SSD.,0.092,0.861,0.047,-0.6417,-1

Normally you buy from Lenovo the least RAM and smallest SSD and upgrade separately but compare how much they charge vs. how much these cost separately normally they are cheaper . As for discounts I think this is the best you will get until Black Friday but don't quote me or hold me to it.

gpsq29,thinkpad,So I see some suggestions for AMD powered E L and T series. While these are great general purpose laptops I use my E495 for programming and playing older games on low settings I worry that it may not be quite the specs you are in the market for. For one thing video editing will likely benefit from a dedicated GPU and possibly a more powerful CPU though that may be less necessary . Finding a laptop like that for around 1000 is going to involve some other compromises. It may be worth looking at Notebookcheck's list of budget multimedia laptops for some good examples. For another the AMD models aren't typically given the best displays. A 250 nit 1080p display is just fine for me but you may want something better quality. Third the E495 that I have is pretty upgradeable and serviceable storage ram battery but more and more models are getting the soldered RAM treatement especially the premium T-series . The Thinkpad most directly targeted for multimedia content generation would be the X1 Extreme. They have a more powerful CPU and a dedicated GPU nice displays and are quite serviceable. It's a little more pricey but I've seen the first generation ones selling for around 1500USD here in the states. I don't know how much that would end up being for you across the pond or if you can find a seller with a good warranty but I suggest you check that model out.,0.014,0.813,0.174,0.989,1
gpsq29,thinkpad,I strongly suggest you to wait for AMD-powered L14 and L15. If you need a new laptop ASAP maxxed out E495 and E595 should be within your price range E series are not as sturdily built hence my suggestion to wait for L14 AMD and L15 AMD but they offer the most performance for the buck. Frankly speaking if the intended use for your new laptop is 50 tabs in a browser I strongly recommend you to switch to Firefox video editing and video capture then I think almost any new ThinkPad except 11e series and maybe i3 models will fare fine. Be prepared for suggestions to strongly consider used T series laptops. However if you do intend to buy a new ThinkPad specifically I'd recommend looking at L series - nowadays their quality got very close to T series and they're cheaper.,0.0,0.875,0.125,0.9423,1

gpplyn,thinkpad,I wouldn't reccomend the UHD version. It drains your battery way too much and u'll see nothing if you run it on 100%.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
gpplyn,thinkpad,I would opt for Full HD. Don’t think you’ll get much from 4K on a 14” display besides the battery drain. 4K display gives you about 3-4 hours of use. FHD gives you around 6-8. The PPI from 1080p is already enough. I actually have to raise the font size on thinkorswim cause the text can be too small to see. I can’t imagine 4K and the wasted resources to upscale. I save 4K for 32” and higher displays. I also run my X1 C7 with 2 x 27” ThinkVisions. Works great via USB-C.,0.034,0.888,0.078,0.6249,1
gpplyn,thinkpad,Please see my recent post about the negatives of the screens on the X1 carbon. A lenovo sales person confirmed to me that all the 1080 FHD models of the X1C8 are low-powered screens even though the configurations on the website don't say it. You are most likely to come across pretty bad ghosting issues with this screen and I personally would avoid it like the COVID-19. Face mask and everything. 4K is beautiful screen but yes glossy and yes drains battery to about 60% running time of what FHD can provide. If you're okay with less battery running time you can try a matte screen protector which significantly reduces the gloss. Lenovo website says they will release the WQHD screen on X1C8 end of this month. I personally would get that and use the screen calibration from notebookcheck.net if it is indeed the same 2019 WQHD which is more than likely to hopefully fix some greenness/yelllowness issues of the factory calibration. Otherwise they will review it and provide the calibration settings at some point. Or you can even calibrate it yourself! x200B Also why not just get X1C7? Its exactly the same except doesn't have the extra logo on front and nearly half the price RN and includes 10th gen CPU,0.017,0.888,0.095,0.9468,1
gpplyn,thinkpad,I have the UHD screen. Colors are beautiful text is very sharp and it is bright. However I find the glossy screen more annoying than I thought I would.

gpqsei,thinkpad,1 I'm not sure sorry I don't own an X1G2 nor do I have an HDR display 2 3 When the discrete GPU is enabled on a ThinkPad the CPU doesn't enter lower C States . C States are modes in which the CPU enters to reduce power consumption and this can really increase battery life and reduce temps. In my case the CPU with the DGPU on idles at about 1 Watt of power whereas with it disabled it idles at 0.5 Watts. This in my case reduces my battery life from 10 to 5 hours so be warned! I use an E490 with a AMD GPU so while this might not be an issue with the Nvidia card you have I did see the C State issue reported with the X1 Carbon 6th gen which do use Nvidia cards. The C State issue would also cause higher temps as putting more power in the CPU would mean more heat is produced thus explaining the higher temps. The article below goes a little more in depth with other battery saving measures to try and compensate for having the discrete graphics enabled I hope this helps!,0.023,0.912,0.065,0.7812,1
gpnr8d,thinkpad,That was one of the sellers/items i considered when i upgraded mine to IPS. Reasons I didn’t buy it • found a good deal on IPS screen 45 • that board is meant to be placed behind the LCD panel that’s what the spacers are for . Some reviews said it was causing some flex on the lcd panel. • i ended up getting the board with a longer cable which is meant for it to go under the keyboard 55 . I’ve been using this setup since beginning of this year and no flickering issues. Some reviews said that the shorter cable “might” be the one causing the flickering issue. Not sure if there’s any truth to that. All i know is that i have the longer cable and no flickering issues. Reason to buy sold as a set so it’s sure to work. It’s difficult to find a lcd panel if you end up with a “compatible” panel it might not work with the conversion board.,0.067,0.9,0.032,-0.5609,-1

gp1uqf,thinkpad,A bit old perhaps but still gold. This is what 69 got me plus some painful shipping costs . The keyboard itself seemed like new if it wasn't for some keycap shine indicating heavy use in its past but definitely well kept. Whilst unfortunately not in the original box it did come with its still-wrapped user guide and a slip showing you Acer Fn hotkeys for some reason... If you're wondering what the TrackPoint is like compared to Unicomp's non-strain gauge pointing sticks then I can simply say this is definitely better even if it's missing some TrackPoint III and IV features . The mouse buttons however are the weak spot of the design - they lack a bit too much tactility for my liking. In comparison Unicomp's mouse buttons are far better. The case feels overtextured compared to standard Model Ms just like my 2004 FRU IBM M13 On-The-Stick from Unicomp. Keeping that other one in mind for contrasting and they both sound the same feel the same and weight about the same.

gpifk7,thinkpad,Milk is unfortunately a bad liquid to spill in terms of its potential corrosive effect and obviously...eventual smell. Think of a cup of milk left in the hot sun the next time you power that machine on. How did you spill? Was it directly onto the keyboard or was it a side splash? How much? Obviously the more you spilled the more likely it was to overfill the keyboard tray and get down into the motherboard. If this came in to the desk my first move would be to flip the machine either on to its side or keyboard side down to drain any remaining liquid. I've never had any use for rice. Honestly if there was enough liquid inside to make that effective the internals would be toast. The good news is that the keyboard can be removed without having to disassemble the entire machine. See page 63. If no sensors are shorted in the keyboard the sugars will still crystalize making that spilled on keyboard crunch. You will want to get something with a high alcohol content listed as safe for electronics to try and remove that. I have used for years. I would also recommend at least removing the back cover tonight so you can see if the liquid got through to the underside of the motherboard.

gp7jeg,thinkpad,Doesn't look like anyone has mentioned this yet but I also think it's because AMD puts in effort with Ryzen to cater to the same market that ThinkPad does whether intentionally or unintentionally - PC enthusiasts.

Most consumers don't care but the same sort of enthusiast that cares about MIL-STD-810G certification and a little red nipple on their laptop would care about these too. A more cynical person might also note that both AMD Ryzen and Lenovo ThinkPad are brands that offer a better alternative to what uninformed consumers get - they're not Intel or Apple after all.

You may use ThrottleStop to undervolt your CPU. I've managed to undervolt mine to -155mV depends on the quality of the CPU die . You may catch several BSODs along the way while fine-tuning your settings. Also pay attention to SpeedShift values basically how aggressively your CPU will go into Turbo Boost you may wish to limit Turbo Boost somewhat at least for one of the profiles . All in all you may get -10C or even better if you limit the aggressive of Turbo Boost . And/or... 3. ... make sure that your BIOS is updated to the latest version and play around with performance slider which is accessible by clicking the battery indicator in the Task Bar. I've noticed that for las 2-3 months noise and heat levels of my X1C6 are significantly bettelower than before even when not using ThrottleStop. Lenovo definitely changed something in how CPU/cooling behaves. 4. Using TP fan application to change your fan speeds is not the ideal solution. Basically you want to have as much performance with as low heat output and fan noise as possible. But TP fan won't let you achieve it.

gp6uij,thinkpad,I have managed to reduce the overheating on a thinkpad t440p using thinkfan. After upgrading to more powerful CPU i started to get my laptop overheating. By tweaking thinkfan I have managed to reduce the temperature. I am using GNU/Linux its quite easy you just need to read some tutorials how overs did it. Otherwise just look for more info on youtube or google it. Thinkpads are quite popular notebooks.,0.0,0.869,0.131,0.8548,1
gp6uij,thinkpad,Before you do any of that take a look at your process manager. See what program is consuming so much CPU to cause throttling. You might have some background process going on. It's strange to me that you have those issues because the fan doesn't even run on my X1 Carbon Gen 6 when watching YouTube. I have an i5 as well. Since you did drop your laptop it might have misaligned your heatsinks so that's a possibility. But normally a laptop wouldn't need repasting in just 2 years of usage to address a big change in cooling like that. Something else is going on in my opinion but do the simplest thing first which is see what program is causing this issue. Download HWinfo64 to monitor temperatures and see when things start throttling. Taking apart the Carbon Gen 6 is no joke from what I've researched. Be sure to study the hardware manual really well.,0.036,0.879,0.084,0.765,1
gpame6,thinkpad,1 Did you check the version 's? Its possible Windows Update updated them first. Compare version 's from Device Manager. 2/3/4 - no idea but interested in the answers but yes I have noticed only Edge lets you watch things at 4k. 5 ThrottleStop - that value is something you have to figure out for each CPU. I would start at -100 mV and go from there. Use TS Bench to test for errors.,0.06,0.809,0.131,0.7579,1

gp7f37,thinkpad,For what it's worth I'm in engineering as well Mech and had an X240 to run SolidWorks - i5-4300U and 8GB RAM. It ran SW fine for small assemblies - and since it was extremely portable I did maybe 50-60% of my CAD on it the rest being on my gaming/workstation PC at home when I needed actual power or just wanted something more responsive. No idea how it compares vs AutoCAD. That being said I'd go for something a little better since it was a bit stuttery and it ran out of RAM with any browser open. Maybe a 5th gen or something. Or maybe a laptop with a dedicated GPU - I think AutoCAD actually uses those unlike SW. Also keep in mind that the T440s and X240 both have a maximum of 8GB RAM per slot. For the T440s this means 12GB max if you have the motherboard with the extra RAM and for the X240 this meant 8GB max no exceptions.

gpcv6f,thinkpad,Have X240 - same platform I think. I agree it's a pretty bendy laptop. I think it's because of the rectangular structure. If you wanted something more rigid you should probably have gone for something else - I find metal laptops to be much more solid though they have the separate problem of being susceptible to dents.,0.079,0.788,0.133,0.4767,1
gpcv6f,thinkpad,I have X21 X60/1 X200/1/t X230 X240 X260 X270 and the '40-'70 feel much more solid than the earlier machines. I think it's because they're made of less parts overall so there's not as much to rub together. Not sure about the X240 but the X250 X260 have the swipe-style fingerprint reader next to the keyboard. This is a weak point and the plastic of the top case around it frequently breaks. The X270 doesn't have this problem since it uses a whole-print reader which is on the palmrest under the arrow keys. If that's broken on yours it might be causing some of the problems you describe. But I'd start by grabbing a copy of the HMM and opening it up to make sure everything is screwed down tight and nothing is broken.,0.186,0.789,0.024,-0.9787,-1

gp6d71,thinkpad,In terms of raw CPU power you're looking at 2x the power for the 8th gen and almost 3x the power for the 10th gen i7 Quite how much that will affect you daily experience is hard to predict but it does sound like your CPU is a bottleneck. Chances are it will be very noticeable. I recently upgraded from a laptop with a Core M7-6Y75 to Core i5-10210u which was about a 3x jump in performance and I'm glad I did! I haven't benchmarked anything but it went from feeling sluggish to buttery smooth.,0.048,0.835,0.117,0.7745,1
gp6d71,thinkpad,im going to suggest the T480s over the t490 i think i suites your needs a bit more and you mentioned that you like the s variants . you can still get them from lenovo Ram comes with 8gb soldered and 1 slot for ddr4. you could add a 16gb stick for a total of 24gb Storage Has a standard m.2 drive that can be accessed by removing 6 screws on the bottom. no need to buy a higher storage capacity from lenovo . get a 512gb stick off amazon etc upgrade it yourself for less money with the added benefit of having a spare m.2 drive after. has a full size ethernet port . its pretty neat it has like a little door that sits flat when opened but closes when no cable attached. they make the 'classic' dock for it and usb-c/thunderbolt 'travel docks' 8th gen intel cpu. they also cost a bit less then the 9th gens since this is going to be an expensive upgrade might as well save where you can as long as it doesnt take away from the experience. x200B just some random persons opinion. both are great machines and whatever you get im sure you'll be happy,0.028,0.826,0.145,0.9737,1
gp8kt3,thinkpad,I don't like XPS. The build quality sucks. ThinkPad on the other hand are built like tanks. I can treat mine very roughly and they hold up incredibly well. For instance I've dropped my ThinkPad with the screen open from chest height numerous times and the machine survived it all. That being said the screen and trackpad on the cheaper ThinkPad models suck. I really like the one on P1 I'm not sure if X1C has similar trackpads. I've seen a lot of dead XPS and Surface Books at work. I don't think I've encountered a dead ThinkPad yet.,0.194,0.705,0.101,-0.8657,-1
gp8kt3,thinkpad,I've done contracting at a few different bases and we issued 9350's and a few newer models as well which were the 15 models. I was constantly bringing different Thinkpads on base to show my colleges and as people came into the command wing to talk with us they would use my Thinkpads and started liking them eventually ordering them for themselves. Needless to say for the most part have been satisfied with all of my Thinkpads I've had a few bad apples but mainly with the cheaper models.

gp8kt3,thinkpad,I went from a 2011 MacBook Air to an XPS 13 9360 to an X230 to an X270. I really liked the XPS form factor but it didn't hold up well after 18 months. The main issues were Awful coil whine. Poor thermals it gets quite hot the fan runs often. Battery lost half its capacity and wasn't great to begin with since I got the 4K screen. Adhesive on the rubber rails on the bottom failed and they came off. Soft touch material collects fingerprints / never looks clean. Stock wifi is awful on Linux and disconnects constantly. I replaced the m.2 card but I believe they started soldering them to the motherboard on later models. If it's the same Broadcom WiFi and you want to run Linux this is a dealkiller. The form factor is really really nice but I won't be buying another one.,0.192,0.741,0.068,-0.9718,-1
gp8kt3,thinkpad,I own and use a Dell XPS 13 9370 and a bunch of older ThinkPads the newest being a X1 Carbon 4th generation. The Dell has a better and brighter screen but I really do like the ThinkPad's keyboard TrackPoint and selection of ports. My Dell only has USB-C ports which isn't ideal.,0.068,0.795,0.137,0.4125,1
gp8kt3,thinkpad,Well I cannot answer your main question but ThinkPads are not perfect either - there are plenty of rants on this subreddit about out of the box issues with new ThinkPad laptops. Although I'm not sure how this compares to the number of complaints about XPS 13 laptops. If you are looking for a similar quality screen materials build weight premium feeling - go with X1 Carbon. X3 /T4 are not on the same level. X3 has a smaller screen but almost the same footprint as X1C for example. Also AMD-based laptops don't have Thunderbolt 3 ports since you've mentioned this feature on the XPS 13 . About being satisfied with the ThinkPad - I'm here for the TrackPoint and keyboard and the keyboard on the Dell laptops is pretty close to the ThinkPad And certainly there are better screens out there - I recommend to read/view reviews regarding the quality of the screens of both models XPS 13 and whatever TP model you'll choose .,0.072,0.799,0.128,0.8406,1
gpcjaf,thinkpad,Ok I am unsure whether not not it is supported but one thing I am sure of is that it will run at reduced speed since pcie 4.0 x4 is equal to pcie 3.0 x8. I know that GPUs are backwards compatible from 4.0 to 3.0. SO you need to check whether or not your x1 carbon support the nvme 1.3 protocol that is used for the firecuda so it should technically work. x200B Why not buy an WDD SN750 Black edition 2TB or a Samsung 970 Evo Plus 970. 1 They are cheaper and 2 Samsungs Quality Control is currently best on the market regarding ssds.

goj560,thinkpad,A really nice build. I still sitting on X230 i7 16GB Ram IPS which I bought a month ago for 57 EUR locked bios but it was super easy to unblock it with a dock incl. DVD-RW and still not be sure what to do. Sell it keep it and modify or just keep it with original parts. Just modified the bios so far and installed Intel 7260AC also 128GB m2 and 1TB 2.5 . Actually a really nice X230 but I have also T440p maxed out and X260 16GB 256GB SSD FHD which I got for 210 EUR.

gp8ajn,thinkpad,This depends on your personal moral compass. But it's hard to buy a laptop that is not at least made in China even if the brand is non-chinese. And this takes you to the next question how many other things you normally buy and are made in China are you willing to stop buying? How much more are you willing to pay to avoid chinese made product? I have no answer to all this. It is not easy.,0.148,0.852,0.0,-0.8468,-1
gp8ajn,thinkpad,Pretty much everything is made in China these days. Those things not made in China are likely made by poorly paid immigrants whether legal or illegal. That is true even for products Made in the USA . I can't speak about Lenovo but I know there are small businesses in China making high quality products in small quantities for niche markets and they probably have no ties to the Chinese government other than paying their taxes. I could be wrong about that though. The US does not have clean hands when it comes to intervention in the affairs of other countries. We also have political prosecutions and political prisoners at both the Federal and state levels. Look at the case of Julian Assange. Look at Russiagate. Look at Charlottesville. As an American I try to buy locally made products from companies that treat their employees and customers well. Sometimes that just isn't possible.,0.101,0.837,0.063,-0.8495,-1
gp8ajn,thinkpad,China is the world's factory and such it is difficult to buy products especially electronics that are not made in China. If you are choosing not to buy from China that is your right.

Please provide evidence to show how Chinese communists are a threat to democracies in the rest of the world.

gp8ajn,thinkpad,I wish ThinkPads were made in Japan by a Japanese brand. Integrity and reliability are absolutely hardwired in Japanese corporate cultures.

gp8ajn,thinkpad,I think about this too. Once in a while I'd hear a rumor that Thinkpads are going to be made in Japan but I think this is unlikely. Maybe if enough of us feel this way some of the world's manufacturing will be moved to India and elsewhere? I'm AM a fan of Thinkpads. I'm not a fan of how China handled this virus.

gp6hx1,thinkpad,I have the T490s with the WQHD HDR . I am using it without scaling. at native resolution. From my experience if you use it as a laptop fairly close to you and not on some desk stand next to an external monitor far away from you text is readable. On some websites you might have to zoom in but that is most often only the case if they went out of their way to make it smaller by default which is maybe 1 in 200 websites. x200B The cons are that it is glossy but then the colors look awesome. Especially for example the Dracula Theme in VSCode looks awesome with the colors. x200B But the biggest drawback is that this monitor has ruined most other monitors for me. I have a 25 WQHD dell u2515h at home which I am now selling since everything looks way to large and not crisp at all. x200B In the end all I could say is that I am happy with my purchase.

gp49r1,thinkpad,I have an E490 and would consider it a Jack Of All Trades With software modification If you can find one these things have good build quality the 1080p matte display is viewable in sunlight but not very color accurate I use an external monitor so that doesn't really bother me but still . The keyboard is amazing and the trackpoint is good but mine has the synaptics variant so the trackpoint speed is on the slow side. The performance out of the box is good with the intel only model but the Radeon RX550X variant cannot cool the CPU and GPU simultaneously. Some software tweaks can rectify this and can make this a very competent little laptop! Davinci Resolve struggles with 4K .H264 unoptimized footage but I use the free version so that's all on the CPU I don't know how to enable GPU acceleration or whether you can in the free version and I haven't tested other codecs yet like .MOV files which will hopefully yield better results. The battery also hits 10 hours on a charge without the use of the DGPU no more no less. Using the laptop for gaming while on battery will only make it last about 2-3 hours however if any program is using the RX550X at all the battery will instantly go from 10 to 5 hours due to the CPU not entering power saving states although this also seems to be an issue with the X1 Carbon as well . I wouldn't recommend the E14 because the cooling is worse and the cooling on the E490 is bad the software can be tweaked to make up for it though there is no microSD card slot it isn't as upgradeable only one ram slot and a higher price for practically the same laptop. If you get the model without the DGPU I would say maybe get it but because you had a laptop with a DGPU I would say you wouldn't want that one I also can't say you can fix the thermal issues I have managed to do so on the Ex90 laptops but I don't have a E1x laptop to test. If you are happy tinkering to get good performance from the DGPU or just get the IGPU model of the E490 I would say get one but if not then don't.

But it will also run hotter and probably reduce battery time. But if that aren’t the most important things it could be worth it. Also you could try to improve the software a bit to limit power when on battery. Main question will be the price... just look what a comparable T430 and the processor itself wouöd cost.,0.056,0.84,0.104,0.5095,1
gp2u3x,thinkpad,I don't think the change of processor itself is an issue if you buy old laptop you may want to repaste processor anyway. The issue is heat dissipation quad core processor heats more than dualcore and t430 is not designed for quad core. You still can buy a laptop then buy another dualcore i7 e.g 3540M replace it and sell quadcore i7 on ebay they go for 80-150 depending on the model . You may also want to double check i7 model with seller as I struggle to find 3680qm on intel website.,0.025,0.946,0.029,-0.1779,-1

gp10yk,thinkpad,For the average consumer ThinkPads are better for their durability since they're business laptops - roll cages spill resistant keyboards and other cool features. You can also purchase better support with them than regular laptops and they might be easier to get repaired down the road. Saying that plenty of business laptop lines Latitude EliteBook maybe even ZenBook and ThinkBook offer the same thing. Plus some of them are still easily user-upgradeable which is something that ThinkPad has lost on a lot of its laptops. Anyway if you're gonna look at ThinkPads as a consumer you should look at these other options too. Honestly the old ThinkPads were cool cuz you could turn them into projects. The new ones don't really have that anymore IMO. Just get whatever has the features you care about. If you like the C930 I'd look at ThinkBook XPS Zenbook and Spectre as well. also the keyboards are really good apparently and maybe you like trackpoints? ,0.013,0.795,0.192,0.9826,1

gp10yk,thinkpad,Yes in general Thinkpads are better built have better input and better connectivity. These two equipments are no different.

The question is if you are willing to pay extra for that or if you are happy with the specs of c930.

gora74,thinkpad,I have a very good experience with thinkpads. Abused them modified my t440p chassis to jerry rig a full size m.2 ssd put a 17 inch screen on my t440s because it fell from a really high table and the screen broke and blew up some fuses put solder in their place only for it to continue working to this day bought a full hd panel later for it . After all my non-quite-well-usage of my thinkpads NONE of them died every single one of them is a snappy little machine.

gora74,thinkpad,My X230 and X1 Extreme haven't had any issues so far. My old E480 ran a bit warm and I accidentally broke off the screw retention thing on the back two screws. It was also a bit more flexy than I'd like. A T470s I picked out for somebody hasn't run into any issues though there is a dented corner. A T440p I picked out for another guy with i7-4900MQ ran hot and some of the keys were a bit janky. It got stolen because he left it in his car and didn't lock the door. The W540 I picked out as a replacement is the only one that really gave me problems. With the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver it stutters like crazy. Had to remove that driver. I also had to turn off fast boot to get it to wake up properly from sleep. It'd power on but get a black screen every other time.

gora74,thinkpad,Yes. I've been using ThinkPads for almost two decades. I had three issues only in all these years The GPU from an R50p I purchased used desoldered from the mainboard because of a defect in this model and excessive heat. The backlight of a T60 died and was replaced by the warranty on-site. The IPS panel of my former X220 has a ghosting issue if you leave the same thing on screen for a while you can see its ghost afterwards All the rest worked and continues to work. My previous working machine is still working at home the X220 and is used carelessly by my 4yo daughter. I had A20m R50p T41 T60 T61 X220 and T480s throughout all years all running at least 10 hours a day the last four travelling in my backpack that used as a foot rest in the plane/bus as travelled.

The T580 is a very good device and not worse in a lot of ways compared to the T15. The T15 does have the better UHD screen option but the FHD screens are about as crappy as they are on the T580. The T15 also offers AX Wi-Fi but you need a router compatible with Wi-Fi 6 for that to be an advantage. I think the T15 has a nicer feel since its base is rubberized vs. rough plastic on the T580 and it is noticeably lighter but there aren't that many more advantages.

goqqgo,thinkpad,First a heatsink would be designed / held by hardware for specific numbers separation and pressure between semiconductor and heatsink. That must be known long before anyone can answer your question. Second most all heat transfers in direct CPU to heatsink contact when using thermal compound. Compound only fills microscopic air gaps to make them thermally conductive. Thermal compound can be ten or twenty times less conductive higher thermal resistance than what transfers most all heat - direct contact. So why add thermal compound? Only because others ordered you to do so? To increase CPU temperatures. To increase thermal resistance. Ignore any answer that does not discuss how this stuff works and the numbers. Why replace a thermal pad? They do not go bad become less thermally conductive even 20 year later with constant use. Third if even considering thermal paste then always ignore any recommendation that does not discuss relevant specification numbers. A first number that only the informed mention is watts per kelvin-meter. Anyone who does not discuss that first specification number always read datasheets is best ignored. Then discover which highly touted and much more expensive brands are only similar or inferior.,0.066,0.86,0.074,0.3927,1
goqqgo,thinkpad,The manual states that you should use 'thermal grease' but the ones i have worked on have this clay like pad on the cpu cooler not as strong as an actual thermal pad but certainly more thickness than you could ever get with paste. Iirc i replaced it with modern 1mm thick modern pad material and worked well enough. Never mix and match pads with paste every transmission form one material to another will add resistance for the heat you want to lose so if anything you could make things worse not to mention that the paste might react with the pad .,0.098,0.811,0.091,-0.422,-1

An x230 is probably your best bet at that point usually they are around 160 but keep in mind that the xx30 series is starting to feel quite old compared to more recent laptops the trackpad Is quite meh I personally find it abysmal .

gokjsv,thinkpad,Yeah I ordered a Lenovo gaming laptop and a mouse for my son so I could appropriate his ThinkPad. Lenovo put two active pending charges against my credit card for the order one for the total order and another one for just the laptop after they shipped the mouse - not cool. Luckily I caught it and it was only a 1200 laptop. They made out like it was no big deal even though those pending charges affect your available credit. Several weeks later as the shipping date was moving farther and farther out I decided to cancel the original laptop and order one that was in stock. They had removed the pending charge for the original laptop prior to my calling to cancel so It should have been an easy transaction. Lenovo put TWO pending charges for the original laptop against my credit card during my phone call with them cancelling the order. Unbelievable. It took several phone calls and e-mails to get everything resolved. The good news is that my son ended up with a better gaming laptop for similar money. The bad news is that it arrived while we still had the bogus pending charges for the cancelled original laptop on our credit card. Buyer beware.,0.112,0.723,0.165,0.9124,1

gooph8,thinkpad,Most laptop cases are some kind of metal alloy. Which means they are opaque by nature. If you wanted a clear or transparent colored shell you will lose out on the strength of that alloy. However if you really wanted to have one no matter what consequences be damned and all make silicone moldings of your case and mix up some slow cure plastic making sure to use a type that can resist high temps and go nuts. 3D printing can also be an option though you would still need to measure and model every single detail of the case into a 3D modeling program and slicer and then make sure you have as accurate of a print as you can get.

goez6o,thinkpad,Intel featuring L14 just became available in the US AMD is yet to follow in June.The tech support videos are already out and base on those the L14 is a very good pick for repair maintenance and upgrade. It looks more of the T490 than the previous L model looks as it had a magnesium frame as well. Still there are no reviews yet so we don't know much on thermal design and display quality. As for your specs I would definitely buy the AMD version it offers slightly more performance with less power. That means less heat better battery life and more comfortable use on the go. Also consider 16 GB RAM the price difference is not that much and in a world where Chrome with a dozen open tab eats 4 GB memory alone 8 GB will soon be a bottleneck. Alas it's easy to upgrade later as well. Thinkpads are in general long lasting and good quality but time to time they have poor displays. It's not a problem for Word and Excel but is an issue for any graphic work. The 300 nits HD screen will likely be good but let's see.

goa99x,thinkpad,X series thinkpads have soldered cpus so theres no easy way around it.

goa99x,thinkpad,As mentioned X230 CPU is soldered. So upgrading CPU will have to include changing motherboard. You have the i5 3320M and i7 3520M but they are not worth the price you’ll spend.

gobblm,thinkpad,DDR4-2666 is a tiny little bit of overkill for L380 as its CPU can only work with RAM at DDR4-2400 speeds maximum. It will work in your laptop it just would perform the same as if it would be a DDR4-2400. If you want absolute best RAM for your laptop I recommend Kingston Hyper X Impact sticks.

gobblm,thinkpad,Hello from L380 land! A memory upgrade is almost always worthwhile. I'd just stick with DDR4 2400 in whatever brand you choose. Faster won't make a difference on this Thinkpad but more is noticable. Most of the time I use Timetec Hynix. The Crucial is probably compatible but there are usually other choices available for less. I've only ever had one unexpected compatibility issue and it was with Crucial. It was when I was swapping memory around in 2 Thinkpads and a Thinkcentre tiny. I had ordered a set of Crucial for the Thinkcentre only to find out that the model I have becomes unstable if Crucial memory is used. So that set ended up in the T480 instead.

go76l1,thinkpad,I suggest you have a look in the NVidia control panel. Maybe there is an option for Vsync. There might also be a similar option in the Intel utility.

goaavl,thinkpad,Since you asked if there was any support for an eGPU it might be possible using the M.2 slot.

go2d9l,thinkpad,While I can't say much about the display brightness I can definitely say a brighter display is good during the day but while working at night it may be too bright. An issue I have with my Dell XPS The differences betweent the i5 and i7 are not that big and usually barely noticeable. But since you got this nice discount I would say go with an i7 to make everything just a bit more future proof. But I would stay away from the models with v pro . That is a feature that only few people need. The difference between the generations is also only a small improvement from one to the next but a 10th gen chip will have better performance and battery life in comparison to a 8th or 9th gen chip. One thing to look out for in the 10th gen chips is the integrated graphics. The chips that have a G1 or G7 the G7 being better than the G1 in their name have vastly improved graphics performance in comparison to the chips that have a U at their end. While cache is not as important as it used to be the general rule of thumb is the more the better. In general it is better to have 2 sticks of 8GB for 16GB in total because then the memory can run in a dual channel mode. Giving you better performance. x200B As for any recommendations Because you want a good screen and speakers I would suggest an X1 Extreme or a P1. These are fairly powerful machines with 9th gen chips and have nvidia graphics chips for good performance or light gaming. But these are also fairly light and portable with an okay battery life. On the cheaper side a T15 is also a really good option. If you want to have maximum lightness and protability and don't need a ton of graphics performance I can recommend the X1 Carbon. x200B I hope I was able to give some insight!

gnb73a,thinkpad,In the past I've only had an Desktop PC but for example for school I needed a Laptop. Thats why I've bought last week an ThinkPad T450. The specs are i7-5600U 12GB RAM 512 GB SSD 1600x900 Display The ThinkPad in general is in a very good condition. I think the batteries are also still quite good. The external battery has got 69 cycles and the internal battery 14. While I tested it the last days the battery lasted about 8-9hr. I would have preffered an IPS Display but I've noticed that especially older ThinkPads with IPS Displays seem to be quite rare and also a bit pricy in Germany. I've paid 250€ for it. Other ThinkPads in that price range only had an 720p Display and had in general lower specs. Overall i'm very happy with my purchase. It's really fast and working with it makes a lot of fun.

gnjiyn,thinkpad,Got this for 30 shipping listed for “parts only” because of fan error. Took a gamble because the seller is also selling a couple more working units that he said were all from the same company. So i’m pretty sure I just need to clean the fans. Disassembled the unit cleaned the hell out of it and voila... still getting fan error lol. Bought a new heatsink on ebay and replaced it today. Now everything is working fine good thing it wasn’t a blown fan fuse . Now I just need to get a new battery.

gnre3k,thinkpad,it depends on your use. what do you plan to get it for? sandy bridge L520 runs much hotter than the x230 ivy bridge and turbo boost on gen 2 is close to useless as it gives more heat than peformance. for that price mostt likely you only have 4gb ram. bump it to 8 or if needed even 16 if possible. ssd upgrade is a must as it will give you a bigger performance boost than any.,0.035,0.896,0.068,0.3818,1
gnre3k,thinkpad,The L520 is LOUD it does not matter what you do with the fan and the thermal paste it is still loud. The problem is that the heatsink is aluminium and even the fans first speed is very fast and that the fan is never off. Its a fast machine otherwise. It beat my I5 T520 and I5 T530 in boot times. The x230i i3 is enough for internet office and videos and compared to the 20 series you get the HD4000 100% improvement usb 3 and the thinklight/BL kybd which might be worth it.

gnae0f,thinkpad,I’ve been wanting to get an old ThinkPad for a while and came across an out of business company auction with lots of ThinkPads. Initially I wanted an X220 but the prices went above what I was prepared to spend. Instead I went for a X240 and won one of the lots. The listing was a bit of a mess description and pictures not matching so in the week between the auction ended and pickup I was very excited to find out if I had made a good deal or just wasted my money. In the meantime while surfing the local classifieds for spareparts etc. as one do I came across a very reasonably priced X201 that I couldn't resist. 4 GB ram i5 processor battery seems decent and very little wear to the outside. The keyboard is great and I love the look of no trackpad. The day came that I could pick up the X240 and my suspicion towards the listing turned out to be justified. First of all the HDD was 250 GB instead of 320 GB. No big deal It's getting swapped with an SSD anyway. Instead of the pictured 3-cell battery it came with a 6-cell battery. Great! Unfortunately the battery was DOA giving the replace due to normal wear warning in Windows and only maintaining a voltage of about 5v. The internal battery appears to be in decent condition and cosmetically the laptop is fine. All in all a fun experience would probably be more critical towards the listing another time. Next up both are getting new SSDs and I also have a new original battery in the mail for the X240. I plan on running a light linux distro possibly Lubuntu on the X201 and dualboot Windows and maybe Fedora on the X240. Both are also going to get a thorough cleaning and get their CPUs repasted. In the future I might upgrade the RAM on the X201 the X240 is already maxed out at 8 GB. Ideally I would like to get a new battery for the X201 but I don't feel like entering the 3rd party battery lottery and an original battery would cost me several times the price I paid for the laptop. Down the road I might look into upgrading the display and the trackpad on the X240 but for one I'm just going to enjoy spending some time fixing up these fine machines.

gnr74p,thinkpad,anybody tried using this adapter to plug the Intel AX200 to your X230? I heard of a guy who did it yes it works. My X230 has BIOS unlocked via 1vyrain so not an issue and since i am not using a WWAN there will be space for the adapter. Well you are set then and if losing access to the full height msata slot doesnt bother you go for it For the Intel 7260ac i know i will have to tape Pin51 for BT to work but are there any modifications needed for the AX200? No i dont think so i checked a couple of screenshot of m.2 adapters and i think pin 51 is not connected on the adapter board. I was considering either using this Adapter approach or native Intel 7260ac mpcie format. AX200 is much newer supports wifi 6 has BT 5.1 isnt on a obsolete standard so you are much more likely to be able to pull it out of the X230 and reuse it on something newer should you need to and probably doesnt need to be taped.

gnswyv,thinkpad,The compatibility of fans and heatsinks between different laptop models is very very low because in most cases these are custom parts designed to fit a particular model and its variants.

gnswyv,thinkpad,Fans move air moving air sound. There are some tweaks that make one fan more quiet than others but when staying within the same physical dimensions and performance amount of air moved the differences in noise will be small if any. Now if your current fan is broken mechanical like rattling and scraping sounds then replacing it with a fresh one will at least remove those sounds giving you an overall better experience. Also some brands just make a shittier product than others resulting in more of these noises being produced on the side even on a new sample you can google about the different brands and how users generally experience the sounds they produce.

gnmlr7,thinkpad,You probably used a screw bit that is one size too big or small. The metal used in most laptop screws are pretty mild and malleable. Stick black insulation tape on it and try to screw it out again. If that doesn't work apply a small dab of metal epoxy to cover up the hole essentially make it flush with the screw surface . Stick a screw bit in straighten it and let the epoxy fully cure. It should be easy to unscrew it after that.

gnmism,thinkpad,The thinkpad rj45 adapter is a direct pin to pin adapter for Ethernet. It retains the internal mac address for networking. This is useful for a corporate environment with many devices all having set ip and Mac addresses so that admins can use mac address access control. Using a thunderbolt adapter is different because instead of matching the Mac address of the computer the Mac address will correspond with the adapter used. This is useful for consumers but would make Mac address access control impossible for corporate environments. Basically all of the people hating on Lenovo for making a proprietary Ethernet port and adapter on their business laptops miss the point that these are for business first and not necessarily for the consumer.

I'm a daily 9 hours T25 / SK-8855 user so hopefully the Shinobi layout won't mess with my muscle memory too much. Regarding tactile feedback - if you're feeling adventurous and have some time for a DIY project you can try swapping your switches to MX clears instead. They are a tad heavier but the tactile bump is very close to what a T25 feels like. If you want to replicate the key travel of a T25 try using two 2 mm thickness o-rings on each keycap. It reduces the key travel quite a bit but still leaves you with a nice tactile bump. As for the TrackPoint's sensitivity that should be configurable with the board's default firmware. IIRC the key combo to adjust this is FN 1 9 . You should be able to get it pretty close to the feel of your favorite ThinkPad with one of those sensitivity levels.,0.0,0.841,0.159,0.9728,1

gng2a8,thinkpad,Those clocks sound quite low. My 3700U can sustain 3.1-3.2GHz boost on all cores under heavy loads. Since the E595 has same cooling capacity you should be seeing much the same. You probably still have some power profile setting limiting it. You should also run some stress tests and monitor the temperatures just in case. As to what goes for RAM you're limited to 2400MHz speeds so if you want to squeeze extra performance there just look for the lowest latency kit available. The best kit I was able to find was CL14 which did drop the memory latency by quite significant margin compared to the CL17 one that my system originally shipped with.,0.093,0.823,0.084,-0.0609,-1

gn1h1w,thinkpad,GPU die is right under the left palmrest. Nothing you can do unfortunately. I repasted with good quality stuff and it's still hot as balls. The W541 is a bitch to repaste BTW it literally requires full disassembly of the entire laptop Even if you do repaste it the GPU won't be producing less heat.

gn1h1w,thinkpad,I don't think repasting would do much in this case as the problem is to do with where the GPU is located instead of at the thermal interface but if you are going to repaste then you might want to add some insulation while you have the W541 disassembled.

gmsh99,thinkpad,Fellow x395 Ubuntu user here! I'm running almost the same specs as you. Ryzen 5 Pro 3500U 16GB 256GB 1080p touch screen fingerprint reader smart card reader. I'm running Ubuntu Mate 18.04. I've had mine for about a month. When I got it I setup W10 just to run the Windows Lenovo Vantage software to make sure all firmware was up to date. Then I installed Ubuntu Mate in legacy mode. Started with Ubuntu Mate 20.04 but was having some strange issues that froze the PC or it would boot to a black screen. Believing it was a kernel issue I opted to go with the trusted Ubuntu Mate 18.04. Its been okay. I still think there are some AMD GPU/Chrome issues where my screen is frozen but the mouse still moves around. However clicking does nothing. I am forced to hold the power button and kill the system. Just today I have disabled GPU rastering in chrome settings to try to isolate the issue. The Ethernet dongle was an extra 30 and so I skipped it. Good to find someone else who is running Ubuntu on the x395.,0.056,0.854,0.09,0.7011,1
gn61zo,thinkpad,If it's for work and you make money then downtime costs you money. In that case I would recommend 3 year next business day service.

gmu2yw,thinkpad,The X-series is lighter and more focused on design. Some models like the X1 Yoga or X390 Yoga has a 360 hinge too which isn't available in the T-series. So if it's just specs you value and you need a normal laptop not a convertible go with the T-series and save some money. It kind of depends on what screen size you need as well. The X-series doesn't have a 15-inch for example. By the way if weight is important to you you can always go for the T490s which is a lighter version of the T490 14-inch .

gmvp8p,thinkpad,In My opinion t470p bcoz it have a better cpu And dual chanel,0.0,0.791,0.209,0.4404,1
gmvp8p,thinkpad,The two laptops couldn't be more different. The T470p notice the p at the end is a workstation meant for sustained workloads rendering etc . The X280 is an ultra portable with smaller screen and emphasis on battery life and non-sustained loads. Things in common 1. Both have 4 core CPUs 2. Both run linux fine only fingerprint sensors are not supported That's it. What is different 1. T470p has a proper 35W CPU with 4c 8threads that can run at full speed for a long time at a huge expense to battery life so expected to work mostly plugged in or on dock . 2. The x280 has a 15W CPU with 4c 8threads that car run at full speed briefly and then settles to lower clocks to avoid overheating. It is still plenty fast for common use. 3. The T470p has a 14 in screen the x280 only 12 inch. If you've never used a 12 inch before expect everything to be small. Or if large expect to have very little real estate to open more than one window at a time. If the x280 has the 1360x768 screen just walk away or be prepared to upgrade not trivial . The T470p comes with a base FHD screen. 4. The T470p has a 2.5 in bay for it's main drive. This can be a 2.5 SATA SSD or a 2.5 HDD or with an adapter a 2280 NVMe SSD limited to 2x PCI lanes. If the one you buy has either for the former two you will need to also buy an adapter to upgrade to NVMe. 5. The x280 only has a 2280 drive either SATA base model or NVMe SSD. 6. The RAM on the T470p is fully upgradable with 2 slots. 7. The X280 has soldered RAM what you buy is what you're stuck with. 8. The X280 has a USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port. The T470p has none. 9. The T470p has a removable battery. The small one lasts about 2.5 hours the bigger one about 6hours. The X280's battery is not removable and lastas around 8 hours for the same use light browsing . 10. The T470p has probably discrete GPU. Works fine in linux. The X280 only has the iGPU. Do you need the dGPU not unless you plan on doing some 3D or other compute tasks or light gaming but if you plan on gaming don't buy a thinkpad . So see what kind of use case you've got and the decision should be as clear as the huge differences between the two laptops. As for the battery going bad if you keep the charger on the answer is most probably . You can replace the battery of the X280 it's a tiny bit more involving. But you can minimise the effects of constant charging by setting thresholds. I hope this helps. P.S. IF you're buying used make sure there are no BIos passwords as if they are unknown there is no way to reset them.,0.036,0.916,0.048,0.7274,1

gmwdgu,thinkpad,My opinion from a general perspective since I have no experience in your workflow/use case.

gmumu1,thinkpad,You don't necessarily need a docking station you could connect the monitors directly to your ThinkPad. Assuming you only have an HDMI port you could connect one monitor with an HDMI cable and the other one with a cable and an adapter for example like HDMI or DisplayPort to USB-C or something if you have that port available . On the other hand it shows better on your desk to use a docking it's a bit cleaner . I'd recommend the ThinkPad USB-C Dock Gen 2 assuming you have a USB-C connector on your ThinkPad 40AS0090US for the US or 40AS0090EU for Europe . This one has two DisplayPort connectors and one HDMI port. As your monitor supports DisplayPort you could connect both monitors with a DisplayPort cable.

gml071,thinkpad,Let's see... Then I found out that sometimes because of course only sometimes the internal HDD caddy doesn't get seen and I have to reboot it often twice before it sees it again. Well there's no caddy for internal disk - only a bracket. Disk itself is connected directly to motherboard. This issue can be triggered by either motherboard or the disk most likely overheating . I had a problem with T430 in the past that disk was malfunctioning and as the result it was not detected by system. After cleaning the device and replacing the thermal paste issue was no longer present. In your case your disk may be the culprit. Oh and when you install it into the Ultra Dock there's a horrible coil whine. This looks like a disk or caddy problem. I have been using second disk adapter official one for years and I never had such an issue. Oh and if you play games newer than 2005 then it will throttle the GPU heavily after approx 30 sec of playing and you will get 10FPS. Have you changed the thermal paste and cleaned the cooling assembly? Want to replace the WiFi chip? Can't! Because it's whitelisted! There was also a whitelist on your T530. Are all modern laptops incompetent? Aren't there any true workstation ThinkPads that DON'T throttle? I don't need a thin laptop I need a FUNCTIONING laptop! There are devices which do not throttle - such as this one check the graph in Processor section . It's not a workstation but still... Majority of devices are not designed to sustain prolonged boost clocks and after few seconds CPU reduces working frequency. In the past vendors tried to keep maximum boost clocks while now they are trying to keep base clocks. Personally I also have the same issue right now. I am looking to change my T540p to something newer but it is more likely not to be a ThinkPad. I have observed that Quadro cards installed in workstations have a tendency to fail after about three years. Current ThinkPads have only soldered GPUs so if they die and you're out of warranty then you need to buy a new device. You may ask what are the choices then? Actually there are three Get longest possible warranty with your device and try to guess if you would need more powerful GPU in the future as you cannot change it later. Buy a device with Thunderbolt 3 port and no dGPU. For gaming you can buy an eGPU enclosure and desktop grade GPU later. This solution looks nice on paper but life is not so easy... Buy a device with replaceable dGPU. The last option requires a bit more comment. There are mobile workstations with replaceable dGPUs - Dell and HP have them in their current porfolio. In the past Lenovo had some of them too but they started to solder everything starting from 2018 generation - last one with replaceable GPU was P71. Personally I'm looking for either Dell Precision 7530 or 7540 as they are only 15.6 devices with replaceable GPUs. Other options - Dell Precision 7730 7740 and HP ZBook 17 G5 and G6 are 17.3 . 7530 and 7540 have some issues/limitations thought Only 2x TB3 and 2x USB-A ports. 2.5 SATA port is available only as an option - you need to order device with HDD disk as otherwise you won't get it. dGPU uses proprietary connector so you cannot upgrade it outside Dell. You can still install 7540's dGPUs in 7530 but it requires additional steps to get drivers to work. There's a lot of odd configurations on the market with poorest screen no camera or no antennas for LTE module so it's hard to find a decent one. Dell warranty is calculated from production date not bought date. There is no problem to find not used devices with half of original warranty time. I'm still waiting with my decision as Lenovo plans to release T15p which seems to be a successor of T540p which I am currently using . Depending on what they will show I will make my final decision.,0.073,0.883,0.044,-0.9669,-1

gmpiz8,thinkpad,My experience with installing linux OS's ALWAYS format the drive you want to install on BEFORE installation. So prepare a live OS iso of the linux of your choice on a USB stick put it in the computer then start the computer.

gmocgw,thinkpad,Dual booting should not affect performance unless the drive gets significantly full due to having two systems on it plus a bunch of data games etc. As far as DB vs VM it depends on your workflow. If you use a lot of windows exclusive programs you are better suited either running windows exclusively or running a VM on Linux. I would research GPU passthrough for this purpose it seems to be a lot easier these days than on early 2010s when I first attempted to do so and failed. A YouTuber I follow does it with incredible success but his workstation is beyond powerful. Also are you gonna use the setup while on battery? If so probably just stick to windows. Linux is already a bit inefficient with battery and a VM on top of it would kill your mobility. If most use is done while plugged in it should be fine.

gmktj6,thinkpad,SSD is replaceable RAM is soldered. Agreed that price markup is insane on the standard Lenovo website but you can occasionally get good sales and value through resellers. I paid close to 1K for the base version i5 8GB/256GB FHD . It was through an industrial reseller for work but I wouldn’t be surprised if you could find it for similar as a commercial user. I imagine upgrading RAM shouldn’t be too much more and you can easily upgrade SSD to 1 TB I did this myself I’m a big fan of the X1Y4. I love the metal chassis it does feel very durable. I took it home from work for quarantine and it’s been my main machine both at the desk plugged in w monitor and also lounging on the couch in tent/tablet mode. At work I used to take it back and forth to the machine shop and other places with no issues. A standard thinkpad would have picked up all sorts of grease on the exteriopalm rest but this has stayed clean which I really love. Compared to a standard X series it is more “premium” so expect to pay for that. If you want better value definitely go for the L14 yoga or the X13 yoga coming out soon but again avoid Lenovo website unless there’s a big sale,0.039,0.781,0.18,0.9883,1

gmhzmd,thinkpad,It would work but you can get a lot cheaper.

gmcg9k,thinkpad,X240s and newer are fine especially if you want portability - people just like hating on new things and this set of laptops was a different chassis from the X230 and its predecessors which people liked a lot . It didn't help that the X240 which kicked off its series was missing physical trackpad buttons and maxed at 8GB RAM both of which were changed in the X250 and newer . Since your budget is fairly low it's a good idea to go for used/refurb laptops - something like an X200-series ThinkPad or an 820-series Elitebook or a E5200/E7200-series Latitude. All of these are business-style laptops which have an abundance of parts you like projects right? and should be easy to work on. These are all also 12.5 laptops though you could go for the 830 Elitebooks or E5300/E7300 Latitudes if you want something bigger. I also want to mention that since you were satisfied with your i7-7500U I would say any i5 or i7 between around 2013-2017 should be fine for you as well - this means anything from Intel's 4000 to 7000 series. There isn't a huge difference between these since they're all just 2 core 4 thread CPUs with more and more efficiency you could even go older than this but starting from the X240 you do get a fairly big improvement in battery life partly from the efficiency increase. Also every new generation came with a better integrated GPU which may improve day-to-day performance a little so I wouldn't go too far from the 7000 series. That being said pretty much any i5 or i7 is guaranteed to be a marked performance increase from your Core 2 Duo and between 2011-2017 there were no significant improvements in CPU tech - it's only until Intel 8th gen came out when they were actually better i5s and i7s became 4 cores . If you really want a zippy laptop put in a good SSD clean install Windows and don't run startup programs you don't need. SSDs are extremely underrated in performance - they get your boot times down to 20s on a bad computer and 8s on a good one and just make day-to-day usage a lot better for less than what a better CPU would cost. Keep in mind that in a lot of these old ish business laptops RAM and SSDs are really fucking easy to upgrade so try not to worry about those too much. Also get the 1080p screen. At 12.5 a higher resolution will give you nothing but I have the 768p screen on my X240 and it sucks. ,0.041,0.775,0.184,0.9959,1

Long as you get a dock that can do 2x4k you will be fine for 2x1440p. However all of the non-thunderbolt docks use display link and having used both I highly recommend a thunderbolt dock if it fits in your budget. Display link is not great past 1080p and is noticeably laggy when moving windows with 2x1440p or 1x4k display with my work t480.

I have used in on Windows and several linux distributions over the 2.5 years I have owned it and I've never had any such problem. But if you want to be sure and if you won't want to boot it in windows grab two usbs make an ubuntu 18.04 live boot and and 20.04 that's an older and a newish kernel.

glzgg0,thinkpad,I was very enthusiastic when I replaced my older XPS 15 9550 with a new ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2 a few months ago. Mate display a proper keyboard and two NVMe SSD slots. The trade-off was that XPS had slicker design and smaller footprint not weight . Performance-wise I could not see much of a difference between the i7-6700HQ and the i7-9750H. But more or less this was expected based on the reviews I had swallowed before the ThinkPad buy. The disappointment with X1E2 was on the bad thermals and the resulting throttling despite the under-voltage. I know this is more Intel to blame than Lenovo or Dell but the latter should have prioritize heat dissipation more than other fancy features. Again I am on a search for a Zen 2 based solution...,0.05,0.922,0.028,-0.4186,-1
glzgg0,thinkpad,Besides the keyboard and lack of ports I would just like to point out the other deal-breaker for me no OLED display on the new XPS. I do admit this may not be a big deal for most people though.,0.108,0.789,0.103,-0.0516,-1
glzgg0,thinkpad,But for people doing real work how is the keyboard not everything?

So the Keyboard alone is more than enough.,0.122,0.819,0.059,-0.5267,-1

glzgg0,thinkpad,You are missing that these two machines are from different generations the current year X1E isn't out yet to compete with the XPS. Also the XPS 15 has 86 Wh of battery not 97 so the difference is negligible. It is further reduced by the larger surface area of the screen which also impacts the battery life. The X1E2 also has the trackpoint if that is important for you. It is also lighter and has two slots for SSD versus one in the XPS 15. Also the XPS seems to be the new design with unknown quirks and problems whereas everything is known and documented about the X1E.,0.066,0.918,0.016,-0.6908,-1
glzgg0,thinkpad,I’ve been thinking long and hard about this. I realize i want a 16 10 screen but will pass on the DELL because of the following reasons. Looks DELL just looks too flashy/toyish. I prefer the nononsense industrial design on the thinkpad. Keyboard/trackpoint Haven’t tested the Keyboard on the new XPS but DELL has never done a great keyboard in my opinion. I’ve tried several Latitudes and previous generation XPS. Didn’t care for them. Very mushy. Ports Nothing to say really. Thinkpad wins. Dongles not an option for me. Macbook nonsense. Durability I think this one is a tie. Either would be well built enough. Solution I will keep my trusty T440s/W520 until Lenovo makes the laptop i want. T14/X1E/Carbon with at least 16 10. Would prefer 3 2.,0.065,0.776,0.159,0.9198,1
glzgg0,thinkpad,I decided to get the X1E and just placed an order. I appreciate it is a CPU generation behind the Dell and doesn't have a 16 10 aspect ratio. But I also managed to get a reasonable discount by stacking a perks-at-work and UK holiday discount. The keyboard ports and general build quality I hope swung it in the Thinkpad's favour. The keyboard was the biggest factor. The stronger CPU in the Dell or any later X1E gen 3 refresh was not a huge issue because neither would compare to the Ryzen 3900X of my desktop. I just ordered the base 9570H model to keep costs down 8gb / 256gb and will upgrade it myself.

gm6fmv,thinkpad,Honestly before you upgrade just see what you're actually bottlenecked by - i.e. if you're running out of RAM get more RAM. If you're running out of SSD space get more SSD. If you're running out of battery get more battery. Also when you say SSD Hard Drive do you mean an SSD a hard drive or an SSHD hybrid drive? Cuz if it's not the first one get a real SSD as your first upgrade. Aside from that there's not much you can really upgrade on your laptop that I would say is worth the effort other than maybe replacing thermal paste if your temps are bad.

gm3fzs,thinkpad,I can only speak from my own experience. My X1E1 is coupled with a Thinkpad Thunderbolt 3 Dock Gen 2 135W 40AN0135US . The machine and dock duo is capable of supporting three external monitors which are ThinkVision S24e 23.8-inch LED Backlit LCD monitors 61CAKCR1US in my case. So my configuration is made up with three external monitors plus the laptop screen. The downside of the 3 1 setup is there is an observable lag when running a few memory/CPU intense programs in the background. The lag can be annoying from time to time but an increase in productivity definitely compensates that deficiency. FYI the lag did not dissipate when I reduced to a 2 1 setup with the dock.,0.081,0.798,0.121,0.705,1
gm3fzs,thinkpad,What you want is going to dependent on how much performance you want out of your laptop. I haven't had any issues with mine and I'm currently connected to two fhd displays one 144hz over displayport with a usb-c to displayport alternate mode adapter and the other 60hz over hdmi on my coronavirus refugee workstation. If you're going to want to use 'all the things all the time' then external GPU however many monitors you want is the answer you will run out of available bandwidth if you have multiple 5k 16 9 mind you not the dual qhd displays that are 5k or 6k monitors connected however at that point you probably already know this. External GPU's give you an abundance in monitor choice. I've run triple external monitors on mine no eGPU 2x4K 60hz 1xFHD 60hz with and without a Thunderbolt 3 Dock Gen2 135W This is the dock to get actual part number varies by your geographical area . The dock is nice if you want to have less cables sticking out from the laptop directly and you stay within the limits it sets. You should be able to run 3 4K displays with the ports available on the laptop. I would recommend against miracast if you want it to be performing well. If you use wifi while using miracast the performance will be worse it will have to split the time it uses for miracast and wifi. Ethernet is pretty much required for network connectivity this adds the cable you were eliminating with miracast back . As for multiple monitors far as I know you're only able to connect one miracast device at a time.,0.019,0.911,0.07,0.8126,1

İf you run a desktop manager with a settings menu gnome kde etc. Just open settings than monitors or something like that. Than configure.

gl7hug,thinkpad,It's a sad day. These machines were absolute beasts and still are. I have purchased every new thinkpad since 1999 and still buy them as they come out for our team but none has lasted as long and as well as the T420. We all use T470 for our daily now but the T420 has been serving in backup capacity for half of my team for two years now. No wonder they modeled the anniversary edition after it. I kept one for myself but with our recent office space being downsized due to covid storage has become scarce. I'm going to miss these soldiers and hope they end up in good hands and serve for another decade.

gloc4d,thinkpad,The min you should be looking at for college is either the T430 T530 or better the T440P T540P or even the W540 W541. The X T and W 20 series are getting old now. The graphics processing is limited and they are showing their age now. The other laptops especially the ?40 series can all be eventually upgraded with faster processors to at least give you a relatively fast computer for the next 3-4 years.

gloc4d,thinkpad,I would recommend the T420/T430/T440/T440P over the X220/X230 for college or uni. You need that extra screen size for side by side web pages. Unless you do most of your work connected to a monitor via display cable I would opt for a 14 .

gloc4d,thinkpad,I will just say that you should not pay too much for it. If you have parts lying around the cost should go down enough to make this worthwhile. Otherwise I'd spend my money elsewhere. For this X220 I found I only put around 50 into it for a new screen. I already had the other things RAM SSD drive . I will be getting a new battery so that's basically another 50- 70. I think it is starting to add up if you want to be budget-conscious here.

The price to performance will be so much greater. Even though these are ultraboook CPUs I have seen reviews where an 8 core 4800U outperformed the intel i7 9750H which is already better than the i5 you are considering.

A replacement heatsink/fan is a more ideal solution. After that run it as a desktop machine or your proposed all in one. I have a few laptops I use lidless.

glln6r,thinkpad,This is a cool project. I broke my X240 similarly only it was me instead of your cat and the keyboard/trackpad still work and I'm thinking about taking out the display assembly and doing the same thing. I didn't think messing with the structural integrity by making mods to the chassis was worth it - plus I can use it it like a ThinkPad Keyboard but with a full computer inside it. Mounting a desktop cooler would be cool but it would be a lot of effort since you'd have to come up with a structurally sound way to do it. I'd say just repaste to improve thermals. That being said I don't think there's such a thing as a fan whitelist so you should be fine in terms of that and even if you weren't you could always just find a different way to plug a 12V 120mm fan in. I'd also like to mention that an i5-8250U won't be leaps and bounds over an i5-2400 unless he's relying on the i5-2400 iGPU. Because of core configs 4c8t vs 4c4t and the potential thermal differences I think the upgrade would be around the same as swapping his i5 with an i7-3770 and a decent cooler. Finally I guarantee there's a market for your motherboard.

glk9po,thinkpad,My main concern is whether windows 7 pro is any good compared to windows 10 pro my current laptop is running. I found you can buy windows 10 online for pretty cheap I did a quick google shopping search and found windows 10 pro license key for anywhere from 5 to 20 the license key gets you the actual operating system right? and I found a windows 10 pro DVD-rom for 40 maybe I could find it cheaper if I shop around . -- Don't bother with licenses. Thinkpads have a Windows licence embedded in their BIOS so no need to buy one. Download Win 10 directly from Microsoft website and install it During installation process once connected to network WIFI or LAN it will check the embedded licence verify it and attach a digital licence to the motherboard ID so no more licence requested for any further installation of Win10 you can do on this laptop . Just in case Windows installation ask for the licence number you can preemptively read/get the embedded licence number from a Linux Live CD/USB like Ubuntu live try by typing this command in a terminal sudo cat /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM But usually Windows 10 installation can read licence directly from bios on Thinkpads models xx40 in 2014 and after. source Note I've installed no later than this week Windows 10 on a Thinkpad Yoga S1 for a family member this Thinkpad embed a Win8.1Pro license which is automatically recognized and validated by Win10 installation process .,0.035,0.889,0.076,0.8094,1

Nah you must be looking for the L/E lines where we cost down everything such as screen brightness battery size shell materials or the very high-end workstation-like X1E P1 P7x where I could righteously charge you more. The T series which have long been known for it's updaradabiliy and/or maintenancebility? You must be joking because eVeRyOnE wAnT tHeM tO bE tHiN aNd LiGhT. I mean just look at the T490 and the T490s. s is thinner and lighter so it shouldn't have any ram slots and hence I could charge you all the sweet sweet ram taxes when you order the machine. Non-s is heavier and cheaper so you got to use plastic track pads and glass fiber shells instead of glass trackpads and magnesium shells. Oh right don't assume you could get a larger battery just because it's a heavier model because iT's ChEaPeR. With these compromises what do we gain? ONE SODIMM SLOT. Anyway I'm just regretting my investment in my T480.

glf2ay,thinkpad,These are completely different boards that dont really compare well. Just try to make clear for yourself what you are looking for in a board think about portability wireless use typing feel and to some point functionality . I would pick the hhkb any day of the week the main upside that the lenovo board has is that its easier to bring with you in a bag and easier to connect but when im traveling ill just use the board straight on my machine so it will have no added benefit whatsoever. If working on a desk you have space for a decent board and mouse so make use of that and dont cling for dear life to the exact same form-factor thats already on your machine thinkpad boards are great for laptops but they simply dont hold a candle to pretty much any half decent 'proper' keyboard.,0.067,0.804,0.13,0.8811,1
glf2ay,thinkpad,I have the original bluetooth version one of that keyboard and also a Realforce 88u TKL with the same topre switches which are used in the HHKB. I love both. The Thinkpad keyboard is small and very light so it is great for portability. But I far prefer the typing experience on a topre switched keyboard. Although some peopl ejust see them as an expensive rubber dome switch the typing experience is so smooth and precise and the 'thok' sound is to die for . So when at home I use the topre. However the HHKB has an unusual layout. It isn't a normal format and isn't even a TKL. Personally I think I would hate that layout. It's too heavy to be really portable and too compromised in layout to match the productivity of a traditional layout. You might want to consider the Realforce R2 newer version than mine which has the same submlime switches but in a regular TKL layout.,0.031,0.917,0.052,0.3142,1

glcwq8,thinkpad,OMG another MX250 issue here. Yeps MX250 sucks badly in T490 and T590 because Lenovo is incapable of setting up their laptops correctly. Anyway follow my manual here Steps to fix but please follow the manual step by step 1. Downgrade bios to 1.53. This will allow your GPU to throttle at 74 degrees C instead of original 56 degrees C and it will get rid of the random CPU throttling to 0 2Ghz stupid Lenovo . 2. Install Throttlestop undervolt and limit boost to 2 4GHz. This will allow your GPU to take a bigger portion of your thermal budget. 3. Contrary to the manual do not overclock the GPU changing the settings seems to mess things up and it is not worth to go through the pain for few more FPS. Yesterday I spend 6h playing GTA V on my T490 with MX250. 1080p Medium settings with TAA enabled. Only once I overheated the battery so much that it actually throttled 60 degrees and I quickly fixed it by allowing it to breath more air. Ask if you have questions.,0.102,0.814,0.084,-0.5498,-1

gl7ol0,thinkpad,I had this ThinkPad T490s for a month now and I realised it makes pop sounds when something changes in the screen. At first I thought it was the eternal Intel HDA problem in Linux but after a while of trying every possible combination of configurations of ALSA Pulseaudio and the Kernel to no avail I heard it at boot time while the Lenovo splash. I switched back to Windows 10 and the pops are still there no matter what I do at a software and firmware level. Is this a technopop variance of coil whine? If it is well that's it but I'm afraid of it being a faulty capacitor about to explode or a badly soldered something making bad contact. The fact that most of the times it obeys to changes on the screen makes me think it's not serious but sometimes it pops just because.

glaa6m,thinkpad,Lenovo X1 Extreme thermal throttling solution Undervolt i7 8750H and OC Scan Nvidia 1050ti I took up an X1 Extreme for weeks of testing and configuring. There are two adjustments which make this ultra-book significantly faster and cooler. I do not recommend repasting its just nonsensical. There are only two basic changes with made significant temp decrease and benchmark increase. Note the X1 Extreme's Core i7-8750H is benchmarking in the top 89% of ALL processors. Which means this X1 Extreme I configured runs faster than nearly 90% of all DELL MAC ETC other systems/configurations with this same processor. Here are result steps below. Cinebench R15 score 1178 up from 966 . Lenovo 20MF000BUS - UserBenchmarks Game 39% Desk 108% Work 79% Full Result Intel Core i7-8750H Nvidia GTX 1050-Ti Mobile Max-Q SSD WDC PC SN720 SDAQNTW-512G-1001 512GB RAM Samsung M471A2K43CB1-CTD 1x16GB Quick context - the i7 8750H is incredibly powerful. To access the full power of SIX cores the system must stay cool. Lenovo's cooling system outperforms Dell and HP in testing and significantly outperforms the Mac Book Pro. So its already just about as fast as you can get in a light thin laptop- but its going to get hot when running all that power. The steps below help keep your processor running at full potential - its a safe and sound no chance of harm. The two-step process must be performed in this order Start by turning off Lenovo intelligent cooling and set the button to performance. Also set your power mode to Best Performance. 1 OPEN MSI Afterburner and RUN OC SCAN This is new tech on latest GPUs. This will automatically run and adjust clock speeds while also undervolting your Nvidia GPU to its max stable state. This will greatly reduce GPU temps and improve framerates. It will also allow your CPU to run faster when both GPU and CPU are under load gaming etc because it will not be drawing as much power away and will generate less heat - leading to NO thermal throttling. Your system is smart it protects itself. NOTE This automatic process will not change the memory speed slider you can do that manually after. Slide it up 450Mhz for safe and sound performance. Save this profile and lets move on. 2 OPEN Intel XTU to safely and securely undervolt. A child could do this. First please forget or ignore all the bloat you may have read posted by extreme tuners which overcomplicate. Forget about throttlestop. Some people are trying to change their processor too much - trust me the uber science nerds at Intel thought of all this already with millions in research and development. I doubt you can balance the needs of your processor better... The ONLY reason we can improve performance here is because we know the one thing that Intel did not know when they made the processor. Intel does not know what laptop their processor is going to end up in. It has to work in a Mac Book or a Dell etc. with different specs and cooling. We do know that this processor is incredibly consistent. Meaning they nearly all undervolt the same way. Totally safe Intel's official XTU app gives you the only settings you need to adjust your i7 to your unique system. Configure your X1 Extreme as follows Open the XTU app and simply slide the slider labeled Core Voltage Offset down to -0.150 V You are done. If you like you can add additional performance safely by also moving the turbo boost power max up to 75.000W for both short and max. Your X1 will not allow you to add too much power. Sliding this up is removing any software handicap - the processor will still limit power per intel specs. Your X1 like your car is monitoring itself and has hard limits which can not be changed by a slider bar duh. Make sure you apply changes close and restart. Open the app on restart and confirm values are set. Expect to see large gains in frames games benchmarks and everyday processing. Anything beyond this is splitting hairs. Would like to conclude with a final word on this system. In my research I have seen post complaining about X1 temp and thermal throttling etc. Some folks report that they retuned the system.. imagine the frustration only to find that ALL ultra-books get hot under load. To be clear - you do not need to change anything about this machine - it is a beast out of box and the temps are outstanding for an ultra book. Its never hot unless gaming and when under load you really can not do better without defying the laws of physics. I sometimes wonder if commenters understand that actual electric is running through system and a lot of it. Touch a 15W light after an hour. Here we have 45 W in a chip the size of your thumb. Fire. Hot. Mac Book Pro if you prefer slow and cool - Lastly kindly note that if you want to watch HD movies in bed then you buy an iPad. This is professional machine with serious power - outperforms pretty much any other laptop on market and most desktops. All best!,0.041,0.82,0.139,0.9984,1
glaa6m,thinkpad,There's definitely a lot more room for improvement with throttlestop. Sure XTU may be simple but throttlestop will give you better results if you know what to undervolt. You can undervolt your CPU cache and Intel GPU at least -100mV.,0.0,0.787,0.213,0.8167,1
glaa6m,thinkpad,Your comment on Intel doesn't know what laptop their processor is going to end up in isn't the reason you can undervolt CPUs. CPU Dies are manufactured in large quantities and will have varying performance. For example the Ryzen 1700x and 1700 are exactly the same circuit and can come from the same batch. Some of the 1700 chips could reach a higher clockspeeds than others in testing and they get branded 1700xs and the ones that cannot get branded 1700s. The reason we can undervolt the 8750h is because Intel has to provide enough power for the lowest denominator in a batch to work at a set frequency. This gives a large room for tuning if you didn't get unlucky in the silicone lottery ,0.021,0.97,0.009,-0.3612,-1
glaa6m,thinkpad,Does anyone else get BSODs when trying to run the OC Scanner?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
glaa6m,thinkpad,The gains are substantial. CPU is able to run at higher frequencies while Gpu under load and GPU is able to maintain max frequency without throttling down. Plus you get a GPU overlock. Under full load GPU temps hit only 60-61c - down from 76-80c. In terms of a real life example - I found low frames using Just Cause 4 at low settings during test and also universe sandbox slowing down simulation substantially after short time. As expected checked monitors and thermal throttling was clocking everything down. Controlling the heat in an X1 means addressing the two major sources. After GPU AND CPU undervolt I report 60 frames in Just Cause at High settings and Universe sandbox is able to fully tax all 6 cores at 3.9ghz for hours of duration without the simulation slowing down at all. So I would say both on paper and real world these changes together are substantial.,0.028,0.932,0.04,0.2023,1

gl1b2g,thinkpad,I have a T470 as my daily driver upgraded from a mid-2012 macbook pro. It's about 10% faster in terms of CPU graphics are a lot better I can play SC2 on medium settings at 45fps instead of low at 10fps. I don't do too many intensive things other than compile code which is a bit slow. I would not recommend going for anything less than a T470. I turned off the intelligent cooling option which seemed to speed things up a little at the expense of having the fans on more often. I got mine with 16GB of ram an SSD and a high dpi display video editing uses a lot of ram so I would recommend getting a ram upgrade and using an SSD if your budget can handle it. I'm using the free calibration display settings from notebookcheck and it removed the blue cast I was getting and it looks much more correct . This might be important when video editing as colors are important. However the srgb production in general is pretty poor so you'd be better off doing it on an external monitor if colors are especially important. I never used a T460 so I can't comment on it unfortunately.,0.058,0.83,0.113,0.8828,1
gl1b2g,thinkpad,I have a T460 my wife has a T470. I think there won't be any difference in speed if you are only considering the cheapest t470 configurations with an i5 CPU. They'll probably have the same CPU 6300u . However T470 has USB-c so I would go with t470 to have a more future proof laptop. Regarding the keyboards the keys on T460 have a longer travel distance. T460's keys almost feel like a desktop whereas the one on T470 is a very good and comfortable laptop keyboard. I think both are beautiful it comes down to what one prefers. I feel like I am faster on T470 probably because the key travel distance. I can add one personal experience regarding the keyboard of T460. I write a lot each day alternating between T460 and different desktop keyboards MS Sculpt Ergonomic Sculpt Comfort and Sculpt Mobile . I think typing on T460's keys is the most enjoyable great feeling and key click sound . However the keys are harder and I get tired faster on T460's keyboard. But that might be only me. So despite my enjoyment of T460's keyboard I would choose T470 if I had to pick between the two today.,0.03,0.837,0.133,0.963,1

gkm3a1,thinkpad,I own a WQHD T480 that I wanted to upgrade to 4k. After some research some people recommended the FRU 01YN122 which I believe belongs to a x1 carbon 4k screen. I decided to buy it on eBay for like 120 including shipping. I got it delivered today and proceeded with the mod. It was pretty easy but you will need a cutter knife to cut some small bumps to make more space for the screen to fit at the bottom left and right. After cutting here and there the screen sat nicely so I just put some double sided tape in the corners and that was it! I'd recommend it to anybody that has a WQHD t480.

gl3p6b,thinkpad,X230's had two screens both were 1366x768. The difference was the type of panel TN for terrible viewing angles/contrast/color and IPS for basically the exact opposite. As for the T480 the stock screen is lackluster in terms of its coverage of the srgb colorspace making it look lifeless. A replacement screen is easy to drop in and there are many choices. If you can find them the low power IPS displays used in the T490 X1C 6/7 series are drop in replacements provided they have the four mounting tabs needed to secure the display to the lid two on the top two on the bottom . Here are your paths to consider If you want the best color but a severe hit to battery life theres some very nice 4k screens out there. If you want better res great color and brightness the 1440p hdr screens are nice. what I have my T480 went from 10 to 8hr max typical iirc. If you want to conserve battery and get the best colocontrast ratio possible a low power screen like the B140han05.7 would be the best choice imo. Screen Suggestions 4k - BOE NV140QUM-N53 16.7m colors 1500 1 contrast ratio 500 nits brightness not sure on install 1440p - JDI LPM140M420 what I have in my T480 and X1Y3 or AUO B140QAN2.0 16.7m colors 1500 1 contrast ratio 500 nits brightness. The JDI Requires WQHD cable brackets and WQHD lid to fit. Swapped all these over works great needed some spacers to keep this slightly smaller screen in place. Good double sided tape would likely have worked as well. Not sure about the AUO screen. 1080p - B140HAN05.7 16.7m colors 1700 1 contrast ratio 400 nits brightness in my X1C7 can confirm nice display Great display cannot confirm if versions are available with the mounting tabs or not. Alternative option B140HAN01.2 or B140HAN 01.3 16.7m colors 800 1 contrast ratio 300 nits brightness. A truly drop in replacement no modding required has mounting tabs better than the N140HCE everyone seems to reccomend as it has a more shades of color think larger crayon box vs smaller Where to get them? Ebay just make sure you have an explicit understanding from the seller that you are getting that exact screen. Return policies are nice as well. Encompass Authorized lenovo parts store needed likely for the lid/brackets/cable. Might be able to source these on ebay but voldermort will likely have hurt the supply lines for this.

gl2pda,thinkpad,Yes and no. Depends on the specific adapter. I havent actually used any of them but done loads of research as I wanted to try one to improve my Yoga's dreadful battery life. as far as I am aware you need one that tells the thinkpad its only a 45w charger. Because I dont know of any USB-C PD power banks that can deliver 65/95w. last time I looked most of the cheap USB-C adapters identify as 95w to the system which most powerbanks will not provide thus it wont charge.,0.059,0.879,0.062,0.0644,1

gky1nj,thinkpad,E series is a good budget option IMO. My thoughts on specs Windows 10 is very slow on HDD especially on a 5400RPM laptop HDD. Unless you are planning to or are okay with using Linux I wouldn't recommend using HDD for a system drive. Like you said you could always upgrade to SSD later but be prepared that Windows 10 will be slow before you upgrade. Also if possible I would avoid getting the model with dedicated graphics card unless you are planning to play games on it. Still the AMD RX 640 is pretty slow and could probably only run less demanding 3D games.,0.054,0.781,0.164,0.9124,1
gky1nj,thinkpad,I played around with an E490s we bought for one of our employees and was impressed with the overall look and feel. The E15 looks like it shares a lot of the same design elements so it should be a pretty nice laptop. I would definitely make sure you get the 250-nit IPS display. It still won't be a great screen but it looks like a pretty cheap upgrade and will be much better. Aside from using an SSD boot drive which it looks like you're planning to add yourself from the comments this would be a high priority spec for me. It will be more impactful in daily usability than the difference between an i5 and an i7. In fact I would strongly consider the i5 if you want to save a few bucks and have the option to fully customize. The real-world performance difference is pretty minimal and certainly not worth the price IMO. 900USD actually isn't a bad price as that's what your configuration is going for right now on the US Lenovo site.,0.021,0.739,0.24,0.9903,1

gkw8ap,thinkpad,The X2xx series are small and light not too bad to work on either in my opinion. For example I have an X240 which I fitted with -240GB SSD -Backlit keyboard -X250 Trackpad -8GB RAM -FHD 1920x1080 IPS panel All of those parts were under 40/ 40/ €40 and all add up to a big difference. I then happened across an X260 i5-6300 motherboard and fitted that and it runs much cooler and efficient. I have tried a few Debian/Ubuntu distros and they all run great. Pop! OS seems to have the best battery life for me with the System76 Power Extension probably because its developed with their own range of laptops in mind Overall I would recommend the newest/powerful model CPU combo you can afford while leaving enough money for upgrades. If you use the standard slim 68 24Wh battery then they weigh under three pounds! The only thing I would warn against is the keyboards are a little small and I can see why people feel they are too cramped but its my daily driver now and i am always getting 6-7 hours out of mine with the stock batteries they have the option of an internal battery for hot-swapping the external ones and I usually have a second battery in my bag as well.

gkw8ap,thinkpad,I'm a comp sci student looking to buy a new laptop and I heard Thinkpads were pretty good. Yea they're pretty good though in the realm of Business Laptops they're not the undisputed king. Latitudes and Elitebooks should also be considered. Which is best comes down to personal preference I find that HPs have more vibrant displays Thinkpads have excellent color accuracy and decent keyboards for a laptop and Latitudes are well balanced. The issue I have right now is that there are so many options for Thinkpads that I feel kind of lost. T460s. It needs to have a good enough battery to last me through the day and it also needs to be sturdy enough to handle my daily abuse I tend to handle my laptops quite roughly T460s. Although you may be coming home with both batteries at 5% battery life is Good not Great . I plan on using this for many years to come and so having it be future proof is a must. Future proofing is a myth. By the time you have the latest CPU you've already been outpaced by another one. Buy used machines every three years you'll be a lot happier. I enjoy being able to rip things apart and tinker with them mostly cause I tend to break them a lot and so it'd be nice if that's possible as well. Good news Thinkpads can be taken apart. Business IT wouldn't have it any other way. Bad news modding eh not the most brilliant idea. It's usually better to leave things stock and just buy something newer or better equipped out of the box or at most swap display A for display B which was also available on your model year. Keyboard/Trackpad mods aren't a terrible idea not great but not terrible but anything more extreme is a no-no-no-no. Since I plan on carrying this around with me daily a lighter option would be nice. T460s. X-series is alright if you're okay with 12.5 screens OR soldered RAM depending on if you take the X1 or X2xx route. I don't know if this makes a difference but I also plan on throwing Linux on the device the minute I get it. Not really. Just get your drivers squared away bad drivers will cause you infinite pain with linux. SUGGESTIONS The market's not super great right now so these prices I give you might be a bit out of date. Welcome to Safer at Home pricing. Less than 200 T450/450s I guess. Cheap but you don't get NVMe or DDR4. From 200-300 T460s. The most underrated T-Series laptop ever. Gets you DDR4 RAM and NVMe on all four PCIe lanes. X260/270 Good if you like 12.5 displays and are alright with having your NVMe drives limited to 2 lanes. From 300-450 T470s Better battery than the T460s thanks to more efficient CPU. Said CPU isn't a major upgrade in any other regard. A485 Good if you need a bit of graphics horsepower on the go for your Minecraft addiction. No PCIe 3.0 x4 for NVMe. From 450-600 T480 The Intel version of the A485. Note you don't get four lanes on NVMe but you get a power efficient quad core making around 30% more power than the A485 and 200% power of the T460s. T480s Same CPUs as the T480 but you get NVMe x4 lanes. WHERE DO YOU BUY? eBay keep an eye out for IT departments tossing machines.,0.06,0.803,0.138,0.9915,1

gkyc3i,thinkpad,I really enjoy my X270. I have gotten it a few months ago and have found a massive liking in the first hour. The Keyboard is good and to me it's the last X series that keeps the spirit of past ThinkPads with upgradable RAM and the double batteries.

gkyc3i,thinkpad,I own both a X270 and T480. If portability is a concern for you then I can say the X270 has a much smaller footprint. If battery life is a concern then the X270 is a much better option than the T490. The X270 is one of the last ThinkPads to offer a dual battery option. The X270 comes with an internal 23Wh battery and you can add up to a 72Wh removable battery for a total of 95 ! Wh while the T490 is stuck with the internal 50Wh battery with no removable option at all. If you want to have long battery life on a T series then I would opt for a T480 instead since it has the dual battery option like the X270.,0.036,0.905,0.059,0.4199,1

gkmhkj,thinkpad,I thought about a very similar project for the T460p/T470p to make a T480p of sorts. The BIOS would need to be modified with the right ME firmware version as newer versions with security fixes prevent this mod from working. My understanding is that Skylake ThinkPads use Bootguard to prevent a modified BIOS from booting but skyra1n works around that. I noticed these CPUs aren't configured to follow their TDP specifications at all in other notebooks so running them at higher power limits might be necessary for best performance. The anemic heatsink and power delivery of the T460p/T470p was what really killed the project on my end but the P50 should be able to better handle the heat of a hexcore Coffee Lake. I don't know if it is possible for the power stages to be upgraded to make them run cooler like on the T440p so you'll need to check out the VRM when you get your P50. I think this project is remotely viable if you can source working CPUs and have all the supporting mods alongside the BGA CPU replacement.,0.034,0.86,0.106,0.897,1
gkmhkj,thinkpad,No clue if it's profitable or not. They did 5 versions of the X62 / X63. I think at 1 000.00 there might be a profit but as you say probably a small one. It's more about the honor.

gkmhkj,thinkpad,This is what I generally call A REALLY BAD IDEA . x200B Why? Why do you want to do this over just buying a P52 with an 8750H already inside? What justifies the jerry-rigging involved and a likely unstable laptop at the end of it all? This makes no sense I cannot fathom a single reason to do this. Coffee Lake CPU into a Skylake Motherboard Z370 to Z170.. etc That's an enthusiast-grade motherboard not a custom designed one designed around the power limitations and space constraints of laptops as well as only being on one CPU architecture Skylake. While it's true Skylake and Coffee Lake are fairly similar it's unreasonable to assume they use the same microcode. They don't. At all. What I am interested in and wondering about is if someone like klem would be able to update the BIOS UEFI microcode to accommodate for the additional CPU. 1. Unlikely. 2. If it were possible you'd be left with an unstable laptop. The P-Series is designed for stability from the factory this would undo all of that. The microcode that would be in your BIOS wouldn't be intended for the hardware you have leading to BSODs and other issues. 3. If you need a 8750H in your P50 wouldn't it be better to fabricate a bracket for a P52 Mobo and use that? That's a lot less failure points and simpler too. I would say it's a better idea to fab a mount for a new motherboard and find some smashed P52 or 53 with a thrashed exterior. Or just buy a P52.,0.079,0.867,0.054,-0.8333,-1

Does it have good driver support on your mac or linux if you use that . 2. How is the build quality? The older gen worked well but didn't feel great button texture was rough plastic and lettering seemed pasted on the body wasn't very rigid . Does this one have a more rubber-like texture on the keys similar to X1 series? 3. How is the key travel on this? The older gen had pretty good key travel. I type more comfortably on that compared to my P1G2 wondering if this one borrowed more than the flat trackpoint buttons from X1 carbon/yoga last year I believe those had the shallowest key travel on thinkpads yet .,0.054,0.783,0.164,0.9743,1

Realistically the only difference is in the drivers and both drivers are updated consistently so I doubt you'd see any major differences.

One thing to note though I heard that the p53 has an underwhelming cooling solution so the problem may also be related to that although I am not sure about this.,0.057,0.737,0.205,0.9352,1
gktd1j,thinkpad,Quadro Red Dead 2 That's your problem wrong workload. The T2000 is meant for Solidworks not shooters. They're designed to provide good stability to scenes with high part counts rather than maximum frames for comparatively low part counts. In other words you could play any game you wanted on a T2000 but you'll get better performance from a GPU designed for games like a 1060. Someone else suggested grabbing Nvidia's drivers for the T2000 so do that it will probably help performance somewhat. Cooling is likely not an issue unless you have a bad fan or bad paste.,0.152,0.699,0.149,-0.09,-1

gklvpg,thinkpad,In my opinion if you don't bash it around and don't spill anything on the keyboard after many years you will find the battery won't hold much of a charge anymore. But that applies to all laptops. As extreme examples I have a 365XD that I bought in 2000 and won't power on any more. I have a 760EL that I bought in 2002 and works fine except the battery. I also have an X61s about 10 years old T420 about 7 years old that work and currently have a 25th anniversary about 2 years old and these all work fine.,0.0,0.961,0.039,0.3818,1
gklvpg,thinkpad,For reliability laptops are pretty reliable and will usually last 8 years if you take care of them For replacement it entirely depends on what you're using the laptop for. It also depends on how fast future processors will be. If you're using it for office word processing then you could be looking at a very long time. For example the X230 and the T430 were released in 2012 and can still be used for basic office work and web browsing. Assuming you have upgraded the ram and moved to a SSD drive The T440P was released in late 2013 and will probably still be effective for another 3-4 years at least. The T540P was released at the same time and will probably be effective for 1-2 years longer than the T440P. However from 2012-2017 Intel was focused making CPU's more energy efficient vs increasing the speed. It wasn't until the T480 was released that the CPU's had a big jump in processing power over the previous year's laptops. Now AMD has come out with faster CPU's and this will encourage Intel to come out with faster CPU's. So in the next few years competition may drive CPU's to become noticeably faster than today's current CPU's. So the replacability is not easily predictable because it really depends on whether you want/need a faster CPU. Another example in 2008 Lenovo released the X61. By 2016 the X61 was dated and was not good enough to play some Youtube videos and some 2K or 4K content. In contrast in 2012 the X230 was released and it can still play YouTube 2K and 4K content.,0.015,0.885,0.1,0.973,1
gklvpg,thinkpad,ThinkPads have pretty long lifespans. Currently I'm using a 10-year-old T410 and the only thing that isn't doing good is the battery. Then again T410s plural and not slim of course weren't ever rewarded for having especially good batteries.,0.167,0.762,0.072,-0.5007,-1
gklvpg,thinkpad,If you take care of it like anything else it will last. Don’t drop or spill things on it and you can probably get 8-10 years out of it stretching it? It’s totally worth it if you get an upgradeable model.

gklvpg,thinkpad,I use an 8 X230 Tablet and 9 X220 year old Thinkpad on a regular basis.

There's some things that have changed with Thinkpads that might hit somebody that owns a new Thinkpad less than me and my older beaters Batteries- No longer easy peasy to replace have to open the case so I guess perhaps just easy ...ish...depending on one's savvy with computers . RAM- not all modern ThinkPads offer user replaceable SODIMMS anymore - the RAM can be soldered to the board Lenovo does make it transparent which models have soldered RAM or not. HDs- similar issue as the RAM but tends to only hit the lower end models and not X or T.

gjv2o1,AcerOfficial,USB-C power banks are for computers that can be powered from a USB-C or Thunderbolt port. You have to do your research before purchasing your computer. The Acer A515-51G series requires a 45w-65w power supply. You can always extend your battery power by changing your power settings to Balanced or Battery Saver. For normal workloads you can expect about 5 hours of power while in Balance power mode. Any sort of gaming or processor intensive applications will reduce that time significantly. Consider the weight size of the power bank. I look for something under 3 pounds that will fit in the laptop bag. Don't expect a power bank to provide a laptop with a full day of power. It is useful for squeezing out an hour or two when you really need to get work done. For traveling with other devices it is a fair reserve power source. You have to shop carefully because not all the models have a 100w port. These links are not recommendations. They are intended to give you an idea of what is available and what features to consider. You have to look carefully at the specs for portable power banks because they are mostly underpowered designed for smaller devices like phones tablets. P.S. Forget anything that has a solar panel or claims it can power your devices from a solar panel. Most portable solar panels only have an output of 10w in EXTREME DIRECT SUNLIGHT. You then lose some of the power in the conversion which can be a 40% loss in most cheaply made devices.

When I first upgraded the RAM in mine and put mostly everything back together it showed power but a black screen nearly shit myself lol.

My guess is that they act as a ground or something for the laptop not entirely sure but once I put those screws back on the laptop worked no problem. Hope this helped! Edit I missed the entire portion of when you put the new components in and they won't boot up my bad!

gdtftt,AcerOfficial,Undervolt numbers are different for different CPU GPU chips. Some does well beyond -80mV offset. But some will crash. You will have to try little by little and apply some CPU GPU stress testing to find out if it's stable for longer periods. Use Intel Extreme Tuning Utility for CPU MSI Afterburner for GPU Voltage - Frequency curve adjustment is really good in that software . Remember Little steps. Like -5mV Stress Check temps for 30 mins If it didn't crash -5mV more and so on. I was able to get -80mV on an i5 and 900mV and 1900MHz on GPU. So my CPU was limited but GPU is efficient. But may not be the case for every silicon. So don't try without testing for stability. OEMs set the Voltage that is stable for All chips. Some may do good some may do bad.

There is a check box that says 'don't ask me this again'. Most people check that. if that is the case you have to go into windows control panels and I can't help on the internet with that. I can tell you this get a plantronics USB combo headphone and mic with the usb plug on the end which is made for Skype it's expected to be branded with a little sticker on the cable in my experience. Those units are rock solid and take a beating my corporation everyone uses this line. Hope that helps. You actually should be able to skype and zoom with the built in speaker and built in microphone if you take whatever you have plugged into the acer audio port reboot and try a session. One more thing your audio port on your acer may have been damaged with something bending and cracking on the inside. Try the USB combo headphone and microphone. Yes they look dorky but they work.

If there are multiple HDMI ports on your monitor please try with each. They could be of a different version.

g5k5em,AcerOfficial,I bought this laptop around February this year and opened the laptop today to see that there's a screen defect - is this a common issue with this laptop? I've contacted Acer and they claim that it is NOT COVERED in their warranty and they want me to pay 600 for repair. Does anyone know why / what I should do?? I feel like this is an issue with Acer and it should be covered. I have only been using this laptop in my house and have handled it pretty carefully so I'm surprised and disappointed to see that there's an issue with the screen when the laptop costs so much.

g3tie0,AcerOfficial,First just try the Acer factory reset and hope the previous owner didn't delete the manufacturer partitions. It would have helped if you had told us the EXACT model and Acer product number for the computer. The most simple tip is just install Windows and stop screwing around on garbage websites that are going to give you really bad advice or infect your computer. You can download the ISO and installer directly from Microsoft AFTER you download all the basic drivers from the Acer support page for that SNID. Put the drivers on a flash drive so you have them ready after Windows installs.

g2mdnh,AcerOfficial,While both units have quad-core processors M.2 PCIe and 2.5 SATA ports. The Aspire 5 is the more advanced computer. It is also thinner and better designed. It also has upgradeable BlueTooth/WiFi in a M.2 port. Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ As with any contemporary laptop expect half the advertised battery life with normal use Power setting set to High Performance. For the price it has a very decent 1080p IPS screen. It has a Gen 1 USB-C port that cannot be used to charge the laptop. A lot of people complain because they think USB-C means do anything a MacBook can do with Thunderbolt . Power Off Charging means you can plug-in your cell phone to charge on that ONE marked USB port when the laptop is turned off. I use it to charge my phone or Kindle while in my backpack. This unit has 4GB RAM soldered on the board with 1 available RAM slot. You can install a 16GB stick of RAM. The M.2 NVMe SSD can be upgraded to a much better SSD. Your best option is a 1TB since the larger SSD has vastly improved performance. I'm a fan of the ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro. It is near the performance of the Samsung NVMe at a much more affordable price. You can add additional storage by installing a 2.5 HDD or SSD drive. Aspire 3 A315-41-R14K The Aspire 3 has one RAM slot for a 16GB stick of RAM. The M.2 port is hidden under the mainboard and involves a LOT of extra disassembly work to install the M.2 SSD. P.S.

fqxan0,AcerOfficial,Why would anyone even want to swap SSD for HDD? The only good thing I've done that improved overall speed is getting an SSD. You don't make any sense. If you want more storage then just install an additional SATA 2.5 Drive. Why do you think Nitro and newer laptop have SATA drive and m.2 slots both? I don't understand you.,0.0,0.862,0.138,0.7882,1
fqxan0,AcerOfficial,I understand your thought process its definitely with merits where you are coming from. We've all been there if using computers for long enough. Its doable if you really want to but.. A common 2.5hdd in a laptop taking bumps and other things will actually be just as prone to failing been seeing it from a guy working with data recovery. A fucked up hdd is just as hit-or-miss to recover from. SSDs without encryption like a phone or using bitlocker or similar a pro would know whats up in the event should it crap out on you with important files on it We're not migrating hdds around as much as we used to. I still own harddrives from 2005 that runs to this day but modern hardware is in a much more expendable state and the laptop probably wont even last long enough for the ssd to hit the writing-wall and you're not gonna be able to migrate the hdd if you swap it out anyway since uefi guid partitions from windows 10 and so forth without extensive adminstrative IT experience. Installing the hdd as a second drive and saving everything you deem needs to be recoverable is a better solution objectively speaking. If you modify your thought process just a smidgen you can have your peace of mind and sanity saved much easier than what you will gain from the hassle of cloning the drive,0.033,0.847,0.12,0.971,1
fqxan0,AcerOfficial,They are setup as RAID0. So get a windows install usb ready. Go in the bios and change the drive interface and shutdown. Pull the ssd. Boot the usb and install windows. If the bios doesn't automatically pick up the hdd as a boot drive you'll have to change that in the bios too. And no you don't always know that a hdd is going out. they have electronics on them too and sometimes they just die without any warning. You are living in an old age. But have fun. And if you don't want to do this yourself...there are specialty places such as exotic pc that will make your mods to the system before you get it.

fqxan0,AcerOfficial,That is an awful idea and will slow down your computer. All you would have to do is clone the drive. Since you don't even know that you would clone the drive you should just forget all about migrating from SSD to HDD because it is a really bad idea. Your preference is due to lack of knowledge. I'm guessing you read something about this idea or some idiot friend of yours convinced you to do it.

fqi7vs,AcerOfficial,How up-to-date are your drivers for both the Intel and NVIDIA GPUs? Don't get these drivers from Acer nor Windows Update as they'll very likely be significantly outdated. For both Intel and NVIDIA get the drivers directly from their sites downloadcenter.intel.com and NVIDIA's driver page use DDU to clean up the drivers install the Intel driver reboot install NVIDIA's driver reboot. As for performance no idea what to do. Having to do Optimus render on NV direct to Intel does have a performance hit but I wouldn't expect it to be that bad. I'd check GPU-Z and make sure the NVIDIA GPU can reach PCI-E 3.0 16X if that's the max it can do on mine it can . Aside from that the only other things that could get in the way is potentially Windows 10 and whatever it feels like doing in regards to fullscreen optimizations and whatever.

Which hard drive came installed in that laptop? Did you add additional RAM? You checked for WiFi card drivers but did you make sure all available Windows updates have installed? Did you check the Acer support page for additional BIOS driver updates? Did you check the Intel site for Intel related driver RST updates? Trying to troubleshoot WiFi issues can be exhausting in public forums Reddit subs. We rarely get the details we need when we ask and the users don't always share the needless tinkering they have done. How is the current WiFi configured? Have you adjusted the card settings to match the available WiFi connection? Many people think the default settings are suppose to magically work in any environment.

Both Monday and Tuesday I tried all day to get ahold of them but I couldn't both through phone calls and through live chat. I was on hold for 4 and a half hours on Tuesday before I finally gave up.

fnllwm,AcerOfficial,Assuming that you have both Intel Graphics and Nvidia GPU drivers installed from their website and the appropriate control panels GUI installed from Windows App Store. Dota is NOT LIGHT. It has to load all the textures and render it whenever you move camera. And if your GPU usage is low then check the Intel Graphics usage too. I'm guessing that it's running on Intel Graphics. If it is then Use Nvidia control panel and Change the Program's GPU manually. Search Graphics in Windows Start to get Microsoft's GPU setting option and add your game there too. Also see if your CPU clock is higher is boosting to higher than 2GHz . If it's 1.6GHz then that's why it's lagging. Probably thermal / Power throttling. Plug in your laptop make sure the fans can suck the air and push it out without anything in the way. Configure Nitro sense for fan speed. Put your Windows in High Performance mode. To display the GPU activity icon in the Windows taskbar click on Desktop from the menu bar and select Display GPU Activity Icon in Notification Area. 3 On the bottom right hand corner you should see the new GPU activity icon If disk usage is high then it could be that you have 4GB or is running out of RAM making your Windows to use the disk.

fnffko,AcerOfficial,Also now do one more little thing download and install intel xtu also keep your laptop connected to second screen while doing this now open xtu then on the left panel click on all controls and then click on graphics in the left panel now set the processor graphics voltage offset to 0.050 yes you read it right don't undervolt it but instead overvolt it now disconnect your laptop from 2nd display and keep using it as usual and definitely run a game or play video or do something for 1 hr at least and see if it crashes and shows the green lines again and report back to me also if ur pc restarts in the middle then do check in xtu if the overvolt is applied or not if u change the processor graphics voltage offset then the processor graphics media voltage will change automatically too so don't worry about it and don't touch any other settings in xtu and report back how your laptop performs now friend .,0.0,0.908,0.092,0.9462,1

fltrvb,AcerOfficial,My 2019 Predator Helios 300 started to have distracting fan noise some three months after I bought it. Grinding and buzzing specifically. I opened a warranty claim and sent the laptop in for service to the repair depot in Texas on the 9th of this month and it is scheduled to arrive at my home on Monday the 23rd. I have confirmed this via the tracking number Acer provided through the FedEx app. I do want to add that I’ve owned many different gaming laptops and Acer is the first manufacturer that did not provide a box and packing materials. Also while Acer suggests that I insure the laptop against any loss or damage when shipping it to the repair depot this was not possible using the shipping label Acer provided. I am left wondering if they insured it for the return shipping. While I like the computer the support experience is far behind other manufacturers.

fkjjea,AcerOfficial,Never listen to any advice that tells you to force the laptop to always use the discrete GPU. You don't have the cooling capability of a desktop computer. You'll end up with overheating issues and all sorts of problems you won't be able to track down. Keep your NVIDIA and Intel drivers and software updated. Let the system automatically switch between video cards when it detects a need for higher performance. You don't need the discrete video card in full use all the time on a laptop. Notice I said update the drivers AND SOFTWARE. Don't just grab the video drivers and forget about the gpu management software. Check for a system BIOS update from the official support page for your computer. Once the simple updates are all done force a Windows update to make sure the rest of your system drivers are up-do-date.

fkae9k,AcerOfficial,Since the guy working on your computer did a half-assed job I seriously doubt you can fix the partitions on your own or with any third party advice. He deleted the recovery tools. If the disks you have are the full package of the Acer recovery then you could spend the time doing the process all over again. However this time around you need to avoid interrupting the process or overriding the automated settings. You'll need to select the delete everything option to get the original partitions recreated. This will wipe the entire drive and delete all the partitions. Then the recovery tools will recreate the proper partitions and restore the original Windows 7 and Acer software. After the mfg restore is finished I'd make a disk image of the entire drive for safekeeping. Then I'd run the free Windows 10 upgrade update all the Windows patches and then make another disk image so you won't have to spend hours doing this all over again if you swap hard drives or have a serious software problem in the future.

If you want to play current AAA games like GTA 5 I would avoid the RX560. It isn't a very fast graphics card. That's why I paid more and got the model with the 1050 Ti.

fjrudy,AcerOfficial,I have that one too so in my opinion it is good for some e-sports games such as dota 2 league of legends pubg fortnite etc. However it is not so good for AAA titles meaning the latest games. Also many people have been complaining myself included about keyboard buttons not working properly and the only solution for that is to replace the keyboard if the laptop is still under a warranty. I bought an external keyboard since I use my laptop for work too and I can't wait for the shop to do the process of sending it receiving it etc. that can take a month or more. Overall it is an ok laptop for gaming if you plan to play e-sports games but I would rather buy something else now and some other brand too knowing what I know. Edit I didn't mention that I paid 870 dollars for it however it is better to add a bit more and to get a laptop with a better GPU and with a similar or better CPU.

ff6hjt,AcerOfficial,Considering how many people have purchased the Helios and Triton series their budget obviously isn't a problem. If you shop smart watch for local sales and online Acer sales you can get a new Helios or Triton for 35-40% off the retail price. If you shop carefully you can find a good laptop that fits your budget. Approx 90% of the Acer product lines have Quad Core processors M.2 NVMe ports and 16-32GB max RAM. At work we converted from 100s of Dell laptops to faster Acer ASUS laptops and cut our cost in half. I own a 500US Acer Aspire 5 with an i5 Quad Core 9th Gen processor 32GB RAM 1TB M.2 SSD and a 2TB 2.5 SSD. It averages about 5 hours of battery life with normal use. The RAM 2TB SSD upgrades bumped the price up an extra 180. I still think I paid a really decent price for a great computer.

fd3vki,AcerOfficial,Get intel extreme tuning device or throttle stop to under volt the cpu I’m guessing the GPU doesn’t overheat they’re supposed to stay around 80C when playing heavy games. Also use predator sense to see if tuning up the fans help but predator sense does take like 10% of the cpu usage.,0.029,0.856,0.116,0.5994,1
fd3vki,AcerOfficial,How does your Mom use the laptop? Does she use it on a table? Bed? How is the room temperature? Laptop's idle temperature? The Helios 300 has a single heat sink that connects both GPU and CPU. If any of them get overheated it will throttle. Make sure you're not using it on Bed and if possible Try elevating the back of the laptop in a way that air can pass through the underside of the laptop. It shouldn't heat up too much. Make sure that you have the Acer Predator software for fan control latest BIOS updates too. It will really help us if you could share some screenshots or temperature numbers using HWinfo software or other equivalent. To check which GPU your software is running on use the Gforce icon in notification area. Also you can use Nvidia Control panel- Manage 3D settings - Program settings and select the program to customize.,0.0,0.917,0.083,0.9012,1
fd3vki,AcerOfficial,Has she tried using the PredatorSense app to monitor the temperature? If you go to the Monitoring tab it will start a running account of both the temps of the gpu and cpu and you can see exactly how hot it gets or if it spikes. You probably want to try this both when playing with it unplugged as well as plugged up so you can get some kind of baseline idea and also look at what temps it is idling at. I've got a very similar laptop same specs except came with 256 hard drive and I did some upgrades on it . Also just putting this out there but if it games completely fine when not plugged in then maybe the problem is software related rather than hardware? I'd definitely try a factory reset before thermal paste you can back games from steam up onto an external drive if you don't want to have to redownload . And just one more thing How long ago did she get the laptop? If it is within a month of purchase she still can get a warranty put on it and I think there is by default a manufacturers warranty of 1 year for 2019 and up predators 2 years before that . However from what I've read doing a repaste yourself voids that warranty although you can do other modifications without voiding the warranty so long as you don't damage anything while doing them and remove them before shipping your system in . Also just putting this out there but probably about 4 months after I got my predator I had some weird issue where my laptop was staying too warm for like a week instead of idling between 35-47 Celsius like normal it was idling in the high 60's to high 70's and when gaming it would be maxed out on like bioshock 1 during just moving around . I was just about to break down and reopen it up but the problem pretty much resolved on its own so I'm not sure if it was a software thing that got worked out or maybe there was a slight fan obstruction that cleared itself. It has pretty much been completely fine for the last several months.,0.034,0.85,0.116,0.9819,1
fd3vki,AcerOfficial,Don't even think about trying to repaste your computer when you lack the expertise to do it properly with a high-quality thermal paste or carbon pad. The risk is too high for potentially causing more damage during disassembly of the computer. The most common heat problem is from tinkering with the settings in an attempt to overclock the system without enough knowledge about computers in general. If anyone has been adjusting the performance settings reset everything to defaults. The second most common tends to be related to tinkering with the video card settings to force the NVIDIA card to always act as primary. This has the high-end GPU working harder all the time instead of the moments when it is really needed. Let the Intel onboard GPU handle the mundane tasks and keep the power draw heat to a minimum. The third most common issue is the CPU voltage running as if the computer is needed for high-end tasks. Modest undervolting has been extremely successful for a large number of reddit members. Other heat related issues have been simple things like not setting the laptop on a firm surface i.e. not nestled snuggly in a blanket on your bed or sofa or other items blocking the air vents.,0.062,0.901,0.036,-0.6771,-1
fcj1zx,AcerOfficial,You didn't tell us which EXACT model you have. You can change the keyboard trackpad mouse option in the BIOS. You can also use the function keys or simply plugin a USB keyboard.

Then you can spend a weekend swapping parts. Make sure you pay attention to the EXACT models because there are different models designs shipped from regions outside your country. ripped adapter cables could mean all sorts of things post a picture so we understand what you are referring to since that is unrelated to a broken hinge . If you are having problems charging the laptop the power connector is actually simple to replace if you can find the small part and have it shipped to your country. I don't try to help with WiFi issues anymore because people either don't provide enough information deviate from the facts or just don't understand very basic terminology. Except for a few damaged WiFi cards all the issues have been end-user related and resulted in very obnoxious behavior. Check your drivers and your WiFi card hardware settings. Then delete the school WiFi profile and recreate it. If the laptop is really banged up damaged. You might need to replace the WiFi adapter for about 30US.

Model Name AN515-54-54W2 Part Number NH.Q5VAA.001 It takes a max of 64GB DDR4-2400/DDR-2666/DDR4-3200 1.2v Non-ECC SoDimms That laptop has two M.2 NVMe ports and a 2.5 SATA drive bay. If you don't know what that means you shouldn't be opening the case. If you have the stock 256GB SSD it will usually be a super cheap SATA SSD instead of a NVMe. You'll be able to have 3 separate SSD drives installed. You definitely want a quality NVMe for your boot drive in M.2 port 1. ADATA makes some great quality hardware that challenges the more expensive Samsung SSD options. Check out the ADATA SU800 2.5 SSD drives and their really fast XPG SX8200 Pro M.2 SSD. The XPG Gammix is the same SSD with a much bigger heatsink attached that won't fit in most laptops.,0.046,0.841,0.113,0.9176,1

f5obry,AcerOfficial,You would need a computer with a M.2 NVMe port. Which if you did have it you wouldn't bother with Optane caching at all. It would make more sense to install a full SSD in the NVMe port instead of wasting the port on a tiny SSD for a partial cache of Windows. The Aspire E class does not have an obvious M.2 NVMe port.

f2xa5t,AcerOfficial,I think it has more to do with the CMOS battery then with the virus as you said that when in shutdown state you have to hold the power button for 20 seconds then the laptop starts a virus can't do that secondly regarding the uninstall i think it is possibly a bad drive. I would suggest you remove the cmos battery out for a while and hold down power button so that the laptop is completely drained up and plug the cmos back in and see if it does any effect report me back what results you get. sorry for the bad English though Edit Also try running S.M.A.R.T. scan on hard drive using software like hard disk sentinel and see if it detects any problem with the drive.

eyalqg,AcerOfficial,Hey you gotta chill yourself first. Everyone stumbles on obstacles and giving up is not the answer. 1 Firstly the most important of all and I cannot stress this enough did you verify the ISO according to its checksum? Its GPG key? You can search articles on how to do this. 2 Have you first updated the BIOS to the latest version? Note when updating BIOS update it incrementally. Starting from the version number directly after the version in your BIOS then repeat until you reach the latest version. 3 Have you tried other linux distros? Ubuntu Linux Mint Manjaro Solus are great distros for newcomers. Note if your CPU and GPU is relatively new try distos that offer newer Linux kernels those that offer 5.x series kernels. You can look at the distro's changelog for more info. 4 Maybe the flash drive or the USB writing tool is the problem. Note Grab another spare flash drive preferably 4GB or more and flash the ISO using Rufus or Etcher. I like to flash using Etcher as it validates the files in the flash drive after flashing. OR Try the original drive in another computer this will tell you what the problem is either the computer or the flash drive. 5 If all else fails you can file a bug report to the distro dev tracker.

exp0ms,AcerOfficial,First that Sandisk is kinda junky for a supposed data center grade SSD. For those of us who manage data centers seeing that tag on a drive tells us it won't be great for performance but it'll probably be the last drive in the rack that might fail. I wouldn't expect much performance from a 6th gen i3 dual-core processor. Since you didn't specify which model you have in that series. you might be lucky and have an M.2 NVMe port that will significantly improve performance over any SATA SSD. A few models in that series also take a max of 32GB RAM so you have an upgrade path that might be wasted on an i3 processor. I'm not advocating straining your budget I'm just making sure you are aware of the advantages and limits of that computer. You didn't mention if you cloned the original drive or ran a clean install of Windows on that SSD. If you ran a clean install you have some cleanup to do. You'll need to disable some of the Win10 resource chokes in the background. i.e. Privacy settings Microsoft account sync settings Cortana settings Game Bar Game DVR settings etc. Keep in mind that your total RAM will run at the speed of the slowest RAM you have installed. While different sized RAM will work in those slots you may end up with unexpected performance loss. DDR works best when it is balanced. The same number of chips same speed and latency. This is the real reason for the recommendation of matched sets of RAM. You did something we are all guilty of occasionally doing you had a spare stick of RAM stuck it in the empty slot. The performance dropped because the RAM controller is working harder to balance the different amount of RAM in each slot in addition to constantly adjusting for the differences in speed and latency.,0.076,0.828,0.096,0.7873,1

I specifically like the Aspire line because of the upgrade potential. They all have a M.2 NVME port for a very fast SSD. Most models also have a 2.5 HDD bay for a second SSD. I prefer the ones with a max of 32GB RAM for the work I do. With easily upgradeable RAM storage a lower cost model can be upgraded to a great computer. You do have to be careful to select one with a FHD IPS 1080p display. I personally don't like the new keyboards for the Aspire 3/5/7 models. The quiet backlit ones I've encountered flex too much and the keys are oddly spaced. The models with a number pad have an awkwardly arranged keypad. They've completely ignored the 10-key standard layout to save space.,0.056,0.824,0.12,0.8836,1

evtf2p,AcerOfficial,Normally I would tell you to simply use the pre-installed Acer Care Center software to check for updated drivers and Acer software. Then go to the official Acer support page for your computer. Check to see if any of the drivers are newer than what you have installed. If you don't see a newer driver it may not exist yet. Many of the drivers in Acer computers are synced with Windows updates to simplify the update process. The exceptions are usually the Intel Nvidia and AMD drivers/software utilities. If you are having a specific problem you should also check the Acer support page for a BIOS update. One easy method to see if a newer driver exists is to open Windows device manager expand each of the device sections and then right-click on each device to select Update Driver then Search Automatically for updated driver software . I do this once every few months so that I get individual downloads instead of a big stack of downloads all at once with Windows Update. x200B If you gives us more details about the problem you are experiencing we might be able to offer more specific suggestions.,0.027,0.903,0.07,0.8126,1

eueb3i,AcerOfficial,I have the same problem with Acer nitro 5. Apparently it seems that you have to reinstall windows from a live usb to solve the problem for good. To solve the problem right now you have to enter the bios and restore the initial configuration. Don't know if it's correct but for me it worked for a bit. After 3 weeks I had the same problem again. So as I said the ultimate solution should be the reinstallation of windows. I don't know if it actually works because I didn't try yet. I believe it's a common problem with Acer nitro 5 even if I called Acer assistance today and they said they never heard of this problem but here on reddit there are 5 post on this problem so...

etvhdx,AcerOfficial,You should start asking questions in the QubeOS forums where people have experimented with different hardware. The VT setting would be in the BIOS or UEFI options in computers with Intel i3 i5 i7 processors. For AMD processors the AMD-V option is also in the BIOS. You won't know if the BIOS is updated or the option is available until you get your hands on the computer. The majority of computers require boot intervention to force booting from USB. Some will autodetect a removable boot device but its an extremely minor issue to tap a key. If you are concerned enough to ask about booting you may not be ready for a non-Windows operating system. I'd also have to question your decision to try virtualization with a dual-core i3 processor. That 4GB RAM soldered to the motherboard may not be enough.

The model shown on the sales page looks like the ET322QK Abmiipx black . The ET322QU bmipx is white. The ET322QU Abmiprx has a completely different stand. That listing at Staples could just be an old discontinued model that they are trying to clear out of the warehouse. Check the manufactured date on the back sticker if you can look at it in the store. I looked at the monitor listed at Staples and the official Acer product page. I don't see any slanted VESA holes. This is the official product page not a retail sales page Acer lists the monitor as being VESA 100 x 100mm compatible . VESA doesn't have anything to do with the display it refers to the standardized mounting hardware built into the back. Portrait mode depends on your video card not the monitor.

ekil1s,AcerOfficial,Press F3 and look at the right side of the screen. You should see info about the core Gpu ram. I expect that the GPU bring used is the intel uhd620? Or is the ram not enough. Maybe your laptop ram is single channel this will decrease performance. Also why do you need more than that? Your screen is only 60hz. My nitro i7-9750h gtx 1650 reachs 200 fps. I use optifine mod.

ejt8qi,AcerOfficial,Always post the EXACT model computer you have so we don't have to post a dozen messages asking questions just to figure out what you have. It looks like someone has been tinkering in the BIOS changed settings. Boot into the BIOS reset to the default settings. Disable the PXE settings since you obviously don't boot to a corporate network that is why it isn't finding a PXE boot device. After that you'll be able to find out if the hard drive is failing. The drive might be bad which forces the BIOS to try a network device. Hopefully you or your brother followed the instructions for creating the system recovery media after receiving dozens of warnings to create the media when you first received the computer.

While you can eventually install a M.2 SSD for a boot drive you are stuck with SATA only instead of NVMe. No matter what anyone tells you with that i3 you should NOT expect a significant performance boost by switching to an M.2 boot drive. It will help but it won't make it super fast.

ect34x,AcerOfficial,The Acer Aspire 3/5/7 line all have PCIe M.2 NVMe ports and 2.5 SATA ports. Since your laptop is from the Brazil distribution region you'll have to verify what storage came with the computer. The U.S. datasheets are not always accurate for models released in other regions. While I strongly recommend a 1TB M.2 SSD as your boot drive you have to decide based on your budget. The 1TB SSD will always have better performance than the smaller drives. If you are going with a 512GB SSD it will be a good economical and mid-range performance choice. Many times there are problems when trying to clone from a larger HDD to a smaller SSD. Especially when the target is a M.2 SSD. You might be better off creating the Acer recovery media so you can install a clean version of Windows to the M.2 SSD. By using the Acer media you'll have all the drivers and Acer pre-installed software. Make sure you disconnect the HDD before you start the install process on the M.2 SSD. Windows will occasionally attempt to use the second drive for storing some temp files and the installer has been known to wipe additional storage media.,0.013,0.887,0.099,0.9413,1
ecg1il,AcerOfficial,They have bit of miscommunication with the web dev people when a new version of the same monitor is released or if there is one tiny difference for models shipped to a different country. I tend to stick with the SNID support page since that is how the warranty is attached to the monitor. The really confusing part is when you don't know they ship completely different specs under the same model series to different parts of the world. I used to keep track of the identity tags that referenced each geographic region and standard differences across the product line.

What gives me confidence is the years of experience with the Swift 5 line that Acer brings into the game here. I used Swift 3 2019 with same specs 1065G7 MX 250 for a couple of days and was super happy with it but would need that touch screen in Swift 5.

eaxzoc,AcerOfficial,I don't have that laptop to be certain but generally speaking most CPUs and GPUs are fine up until 90C at which point they start to slow down to reduce the temps and then speed back up once they reach a temp below 90C.

eaxzoc,AcerOfficial,Yes those temps are within reason. Especially for a laptop since they usually have a much harder time keeping temps down due to a much more constricted amount of airflow and limited radiator surface. However you can apply better TIM Kryonaut for instance to your GPU and CPU dies if you wish as well as undervolt if you want to get lower temps. Neither of these things are all that necessary though unless you find some manner of performance drops to be happening with your applications due to the heat.,0.043,0.835,0.122,0.765,1

eb2iie,AcerOfficial,Soft drinks are sticky and acidic. If you purchased the accidental damage extended warranty you should file a claim to get the computer properly cleaned or replaced. The keyboard isn't sealed or water resistant so the liquid has seeped through onto the the system board. Next time immediately turn it off flip it upside down or in its side so the fluid streams to the edge. Its cheaper to replace a keyboard than the internal components. If the computer warranty has expired you can find amateur YouTube videos showing how to disassemble the laptop and attempt cleaning.

Toshiba charger Output 19V 4.74A with a 5.5mm DC connector Since the voltage and barrel connector are a good match you have the option to look for a replacement adapter for the Toshiba since it can be used for the monitor. Try the Acer store accessory finder to see if you can get the correct model/part number. That will make it easier to search for adapters on the Best Buy website. I do see some aftermarket adapters on Amazon for 10- 15. Best Buy does have some universal chargers with different DC barrel connectors. They also carry the DENAQ line of aftermarket adapters that MIGHT have the correct size DC connector.

ea6j4d,AcerOfficial,Do anyone know a way to restore it after a Windows clean instal Sure you make sure you create the Acer MFG recovery media before you do anything to your computer. That is pretty much Computer Maintenance 101. Always make a disk image before tinkering or at least create the original MFG recovery media. That process exists so you can preserve all the initial drivers for the computer and the original software utilities.

Supposedly the amount of shared RAM is also affected by the power settings. I've tested mine with Battery Saver and High Performance using 8/16/32GB RAM. The shared RAM was never consistent.

Look it up on Acer's website and if there is an updating software available use that to mass update everything. Also use Windows Update to search for the latest patches and drivers. It will likely require you to reboot your machine and once you have look for more updates and keep rebooting and looking until it says you're up to date. Also updating your BIOS may solve the issue if none of the above does but dont concern yourself with that until you know the other stuff doesnt work since we dont know how stable your system is at the moment and accidentally messing up a bios flash isnt a fun day.,0.064,0.926,0.01,-0.8217,-1

e55wdx,AcerOfficial,ok If you are recording your desktop then you need to match your main gpu which is used to display the desktop in your case it would be the Intel one with the gpu that is used by obs itself and this can be done like follows - open the Nvidia control panel and go to manage 3d settings -got to the program tap and search for the obs studio in the select a program if it's not there then you need to browse it and then add it -and then change the preferred GPU to integrated gpu and hit apply -now OBS should work perfectly -note that if you want to record a game that uses the external GPU in full screen you need to change the preferred gpu to Nvidia's gpu if your game is running on nvidia's gpu. I hope that helps you One last thing after I updated to the latest windows 10 1909 version I had this black screen problem and the above solution didn't work for me if that applies to you too then you need to do as follow go to windows settings and then go to system settings the go to display settings then go all the way down and select graphics settings then in choose an app to set a preference select obs and choose power saving mode to force it to work on the integrated GPU,0.011,0.914,0.074,0.9231,1

e4u7du,AcerOfficial,This is why you should always create the recovery media first. Then you can boot reinstall with all the drivers available. Since your goal was a complete wipe reinstall of Windows you haven't harmed the hardware. Usually when the install fails the drive setup the user has been tinkering with the drive partitions before running the system recovery. It seems to get harder to explain to people to just let the software do the work as it as intended. When you recycle a computer you don't want any personal information on it and its nice to provide it with a clean install of Windows in case it is resold. That is all that confusing message is trying to tell you. You can try the other options to install Windows from the Acer recovery partition. If you didn't create the Acer recovery media and you follow any advice to use the generic Windows Media installer from the Microsoft website expect to lose all the Acer drivers and the original pre-installed software.

It seemed to me from everything I went through figuring this out at factory it got locked to FreeSync Normal Overdrive 60Hz. Plug in the monitor via DVI freesync isn't supported and shuts off in the on screen monitor control panel you should now be able to turn off Overdrive. Plug it back in using the Display Port and double check all Nvidia Control Panel options and OSD menu that Gsync is on.

e2vzgc,AcerOfficial,How do I upgrade my HDD eithout losing warranty? Are you in the US? You can't legally lose your warranty by opening the laptop unless you actually cause provable damage by doing so. Simply opening the laptop or any electronic including game consoles and breaking any void if broken stickers or other indicators can't void the warranty regardless of what the manufacturer says. With that out of the way though all the Acer laptops I've had so far have a small doosection on the bottom that allows you to add/replace HDDs easily without having to open the entire laptop. I don't imagine there's too many things that could go wrong with putting the HDD into the laptop. You can definitely find many videos of other people doing this with other laptops for a general idea on the process. For someone new to this I imagine it would take about 5-15 minutes with being careful. Anyone experienced could likely do it in less than 5 minutes. Typically with a standard 2.5 HDD or even SSD it involves 1. Removing a screw 2. Lifting the panel off the laptop 3. Removing the HDD caddy if it's in the laptop still typically involves removing 4 screws 4. Put the HDD into the caddy typically via 4 separate screws 5. Carefully connect the HDD while in the caddy to the SATA/connection cable the hardest part but easy if you're careful and take your time 6. Reverse steps 1-3 put back the 4 caddy screws put the panel back put the screw back 7. Power on the laptop and do whatever with the HDD As to why they didn't include the HDD in the laptop to begin with no idea. In my case I would have preferred the HDD to be outside the laptop since I don't plan on using it at all and it would have saved me the effort of taking it out lol,0.061,0.874,0.064,0.6112,1

dwezd9,AcerOfficial,My personal preference is to use the larger drive as the boot drive. People tend to forget that Windows copies a lot of additional files to the boot drive when installing software. Plus not only is the 1TB much faster than the 256GB you won't have to keep deleting files to clear space as often. Macrium Reflect Free does a very nice job of cloning and it has a tool to fix boot problems when you are done. In this case a clean install of Windows is not necessary because the source drive is M.2. The simple way is to clone the 256GB drive to the 1TB.

dtl44r,AcerOfficial,Some of the monitors have a 3 year warranty. Normally I'd suggest that you login to your Acer account to check the warranty status. Sadly many people never register their products and miss the occasional opportunity to extend the warranty another few years for free or for a really low price. Before you decide to pay that shipping cost send it off check around your town to see if there is a TV or computer repair shop that might be able to fix it. There is a chance it simply needs a new backlight or a ribbon cable reattached. Their fee to fix it or at least diagnose the problem might be cheaper than the shipping to send off the monitor. When dealing with electronics where the cheapest vendor supplies the materials you don't always get consistent performance from the finished product.

My M.2 SSD that came with it stays in and keeps the operating system. Upgrade was super easy. Took me 20min. Watched official video from Acer on YouTube. I reconnect battery and boot. I first check the BIOS Everything got detected correctly. I boot Manjaro. Everything fine. I format the new SSD I shutdown and put the bottom case on properly again and screw screws back in. I reboot No bootable device found. My body shivers hot and cold and my pulse goes to 200. I reset the BIOS many times by pressing powee button for 2 minutes Nothing. I disconnect the SSD again. Nothing. I boot a linux live stick. Hard drived do not show. I find out Manjaro Live USB lets me detect other bootloaders. It finds my M.2 SSD's grub efi. How if the BIOS cannot find the drives?

Since the SSD has a low power use changing this setting shouldn't have a big impact on your battery life.

Unless you are paying the premium price ordering direct from Acer you need to look carefully at the specs of any computer you are buying ask the seller or retail store direct questions about the specs. Also if you are buying any of the systems that show they ship with an SSD drive you need to confirm if it is M.2 or 2.5 .

dhfqgi,AcerOfficial,See also This input autoscan problem seems to be a more common with certain Windows 10 updates. You are fighting a few issues all at once. The monitor has the autoscan ability but you can't change it via OSD it could be Windows or your GPU that is triggering the scan. Sometimes Windows gets a little confused and thinks the device has been removed. Windows then sends a signal to the GPU to see if the display is active. The GPU acknowledges it has power tries to talk to the monitor. Its like having 3 different traffic cops speaking different languages but trying to respond to hand signals they all know while also attempting to direct traffic. Some folks circumvented the entire cluster and added a special adapter or cable with a active chipset monitoring not the real term but I simplified it .

dgn1by,AcerOfficial,I own a 2016 Acer predator so i can't answer the 1st question but since 2 and 3 are general i will help you avoid some of the mistakes I made. 2. Check and monitor your temps. After about a year of usage suddenly my FPS for gaming tanked. I used Speccy and realised the motherboard was overheating. I opened up the laptop chassis and found that one of the fan connectors for the mobo was loose. Then the same thing happened but for the CPU and GPU. I changed the horrible gunk Acer calls thermal paste and voila-temperatures in high 60's to low 70's with a gaming load. My only regret is I over-tightened the screws and stripped some of them. Also clean the exhaust fans from time to time to avoid build up of dust which will increase your temperatures. Get a good waterproof backpack to carry it with extra padding. If you use it for work and home gaming invest in an extra power adapter don't need it to be the original one . That way all you have to do is plug it in and won't risk damaging the power adapter like I did. Plus its a real hassle to cable manage and carry the extra brick and cord. 3.I do recommend getting a good laptop cooler. I ordered this one but it hasn't been delivered yet. Again a mistake not to use one from the start as it actually will boost performance since the CPU and GPU boost frequencies will be maintained if thermal throttling doesn't occur. Let me know if you have any other doubts and congrats on your new laptop.,0.109,0.74,0.152,0.9385,1
dgn1by,AcerOfficial,Yes you can upgrade the version of Windows. The license keys aren't as accessible as they used to be. This is Microsoft's way to fight back against software piracy. It also solves the problem of losing license keys original media after having the computer for a few years. Make sure you get a minimum 16GB USB Flash drive to create your recovery media. Any significant changes are recorded in your Microsoft account so you don't have to keep track of so much information. Once you login to the computer with your Microsoft account the hardware profile and license keys are saved. The nice part is that if you ever have to wipe reinstall on that computer you simply login with your Microsoft account when you are done and the activation will be automatic. Fortunately cleaning the computer software and physical dust is a lot easier. You'll notice temperature changes as you put it to use over time if dust builds up inside you'll notice the constant higher temperatures. Don't be too alarmed about the idea of dust buildup. it happens to anything that has force air flow in an enclosure. It simply took a long time for the general public to be aware of the dust in their computers. Don't make adjustments to how your computer operates until items like heat performance affect your use. While there are a lot of suggestions for overclocking undervolting and general gaming those changes can also damage your computer if done incorrectly.,0.042,0.859,0.099,0.9029,1

You should always remove any add-on items like RAM hard drive upgrades because they can be removed disposed by the center tech since they are not covered under the warranty. If the computer shipped with a 256GB SSD and you replaced it with a 1TB faster performing SSD expect the 1TB to be removed replaced with a lower quality 256GB.

Essentially you are going to remove the screws for the case remove the cover remove the screws for the heat pipes fans. Clean the fans. Even though you should replace them if they are really packed with dust because you can't clean the fan bearings where the dust causes the problems. Removing the heat pipe s will reveal the heatsinks and then the thermal compound locations. Then put everything back together. You will should see some little squares of squishy material.

d7z3tj,AcerOfficial,No long-term risk. 4 years is a good lifespan for that model. Its also time to start shopping for a replacement hard drive. For most home users you really should plan on replacing the hard drive with newer technology at the 3-4 year mark. That's if anyone keeps a computer that long anymore. Its hard enough to get people to backup their data. This is why I always tell people to open the case so they can get their eyes on the part and read the correct part number from a part known to work correctly. There are far too many people trying to take shortcuts for RAM and batteries. M.2 drives too where applicable Changing from 5600mAh to 2650mAh will be a significant reduction in battery charge. I'd be more concerned about the output rating. In a pinch or to be budget friendly you have a battery that will last until you can get a larger capacity or a new laptop. Just change your power settings to reduce the display to 80% and reduce the CPU MAX to 80 and you should squeeze a few hours out of it.

Since it sounds like you have no backups this might be the best thing. Don't know what size drive you have now but you should be able to put a 500gb SATA ssd in it. You may have to update bios.

d5uls4,AcerOfficial,Welcome to REDDIT! Many of the answers and additional information can always be obtained from the support page for your computer. You would have been redirected to that page when you registered your computer for the warranty. You probably already found the general data sheet Always look up the part number of RAM currently installed in your computer open the case look at it to make sure you get the correct specs. Your E5 laptop will use 16GB max of DDR3 PC3-12800 -BUT- It specifically needs low voltage so-dimms labeled DDR3L-1600. Many people ignore that L which indicates low voltage and they find out the hard way that higher voltage RAM will not work at all in their computer. You definitely want to splurge add more RAM. Another 4GB stick of RAM will help with day-to-day regular work. If you are debating the 16GB upgrade it really depends on how you use your computer most people are surprised that they don't need to strain their budget and max out on RAM because they don't really stress their computer enough to make use of it. Yeah I'll admit I maxxed mine to 32GB just because I could and not because 20% of my work actually needs it. If your budget can stretch a bit consider getting an SSD drive for your primary boot drive and then move your current drive to the CD-Rom caddy. You can easily clone the current drive to the new SSD with the free version of Macrium. That one change will give you a definite performance boost for that particular laptop and add a couple more years of life to it. The ADATA Su800 is a fast economical 1TB SSD. It performs very close to Samsung Intel and Crucial at half the cost. It is frequently on sale at Amazon for under 100. Remember that with all SSDs the larger the capacity the better performance you'll get. Those CD-Rom replacement HDD caddies are pretty darn cool. I've used them on a couple ASUS laptops and they worked great. Adding more storage is a much better use of that CD-Rom bay. You do want to update the BIOS for any problem corrections for your system and to resolve SSD related issues. Most driver updates should be delivered by Windows Updates but it never hurts to check them too. Before you start all this make sure you get at least a 16GB usb drive to create the system recovery media.

You can also use a small piece of rubber or foam to hold it in place. Did you already have a drive installed? The bracket can be easily removed from the previous drive.

d49s10,AcerOfficial,It depends on your budget. I've researched tested SSD for my ACERs and was surprised at how flexible manufacturers are when posting specs. If you want to spend the money the higher-end Samsung and Intel lines are peak performers at a premium price. If you want within 95% of the same performance for a drastically lower price sometimes 50% lower the ADATA product line is really impressive. I personally went with the ADATA SX8200 Pro M.2 1TB 150US at Amazon and the ADATA SU800 2.5 2TB SSD. There are a lot of complaints but none of them are about the 1TB or 2TB SSD products which are faster than the lower capacity products. I wanted the extra space speeds close to Samsung 970 EVO Plus and a decent price. I move manipulate a lot of data so I needed a faster data drive. Without overspending now I'll be more willing to upgrade to a 4TB SSD when they have more reasonable prices. In my case I simply used the free version of Macrium to clone the boot drive to the new M.2 SSD swapped them and booted up without any problems. I saved an image of my original boot drive for safekeeping. Normally I save the original drive but in this case I bought a little external case for it so I could use it for cloning then backups. If you are just looking for a second drive for storage in the 2.5 bay you don't need to focus as much on write speeds as you would if you were shopping for a boot drive.,0.04,0.85,0.109,0.9488,1

d1b516,AcerOfficial,That isn't an actual product page. It is what is considered part of the line card . It lists the base model and options that are controlled by the regional distributor. You'll need to search for Aspire 5 A515-54G which should produce a few more retail distributors. Once you find the regional distributor i.e. Amazon.com Walmart.com NewEgg.com etc you'll see what options they have to choose from. Some specific units also have export or distribution limitations so you might have to get creative when ordering from Ottawa. ACER ASUS and MSI are very popular because of the flexibility for user installable upgrades. Most purchasers with some tech experience will buy a moderately priced base unit with the best CPU they can afford and then upgrade the RAM and hard drive for larger capacity or better quality components. The ACER Aspire 5 line ships with a rather low-end M.2 SATA B M key SSD installed. The M.2 port is a 2280 PCIe NVMe port which is easily compatible with nearly any M.2 2280 NVMe M key SSD Samsung ADATA Intel etc . The Aspire line also has an opening for a 2.5 SATA drive. Although the mounting kit should be inside the computer case you might have to order the 2.5 SATA cable mounting bracket if it isn't provided with your purchase. Some distributors remove the kit so they can sell it separately.

d05u7x,AcerOfficial,I feel like I’m in a similar situation.

I took advantage of the Acer 24/7 chat support to have some employee basically tell me it’s not his problem assured me my laptop is new and proceeded to tell me that if I sent it in to get it checked and they found physical damages they’d charge me for them because I may have caused them even though it came out the box that way .

d05u7x,AcerOfficial,Battery life is always misleading. No manufacturer will ever tell you how they managed to get the number of hours they state.

Sometimes just changing the power profile to Balanced reducing screen brightness to 80 will gain a couple extra hours. ugh its frustrating dealing with a Taiwanese company that creates subsidiaries in America Canada to make it easier to distribute their products without import taxes. Unfortunately although Acer America manages operations for the United States and Canada their support system is awful. Fortunately for you you have your receipts from the purchase which clearly show when where you made the purchase.

d055cv,AcerOfficial,My first thought is that you have a low-end HDMI cable that is only wired for video or the cable isn't plugged in tightly. I've been stuck with one of those really cheap cables and it gave me a raging headache trying to track down problems. The other possibility is that you are simply missing a couple drivers. If you ran a clean install from a Windows disc instead of from the manufacturer's partition you might be missing component drivers. Make sure you check Device Manager for any red or yellow flags indicating a problem with a component. Sometimes manually starting a Windows Update scan will catch any missing drivers. With Acer computers I always work my way down the list in Device Manage checking for updates with automatically search . Sometimes a component will update even when Acer Windows Update doesn't show a new driver is available. I've forgotten if that 1050Ti model has the MaxxAudio utility. You'll want to use the audio software instead of the Windows Sound Console to change any settings. You should also check for MaxxAudio updates. Don't forget to download the latest Nvidia GeForce software. Sometimes when updating drivers people forget about the additional software updates.,0.094,0.86,0.047,-0.8647,-1

cztf5s,AcerOfficial,nhermosilla14 is right the memory SSD are good upgrade options. You wouldn't be able to replace the processor. With that low-end processor you really won't see a significant performance increase by installing 32GB RAM. You might end up spending more than the base cost of the laptop for the upgrades.

If you compared the version numbers of the other drivers on your computer with the versions on the support page for your laptop you could be missing an update pushed out by Windows Update. I'd check your support page for a Maxx Audio update and individual driver updates.

cty74v,AcerOfficial,Ringgit to U.S. dollar conversion puts your budget around 1200 U.S. for a video editing rig. I think you might be limited to specific models permitted to be distributed in Malaysia. With video editing you'll definitely want to select a model that has a dedicated video card. The Nitro or Helios series are pushed toward gamers but they have high performance GPU video that will fit your needs. You should spend time reading the Reddit subs discussing Nitro 5 and Helios 300 With quad core processing PCIe SSD and an upgrade to 32GB RAM you'll enjoy the ease of editing and the response of the occasional game. If you were only occasionally editing video I'd look at the mid-range laptops for about half the price. They won't have the discrete video or higher resolution screens but the rest of the components will be nearly the same. I have the most experience with the Aspire 3 5 models. I personally prefer the Aspire 5 A515-52-526C. It has a max of 32GB RAM PCIe and SATA SSD ports 15.6 screen with 1080P resolution and a quad-core i5-8265U Another lower budget option is the Acer Aspire 5 A515-51-523X 15.6 Full HD 1920 x 1080 Intel i5-8250U 8GB DDR4 256GB SSD Windows 10 Home The Aspire 5 has a decent resolution screen already boots from a M.2 SSD. The M.2 will most likely be a SATA SSD in the PCIe slot. Every one I have opened has been a SATA SSD. Its an easy clone replace with PCIe SSD to boost speed. It comes with 4GB Ram soldered and 4GB in the slot. It runs surprisingly well on 8GB but I'd recommend replacing the 4GB stick with 8GB or 16GB depending on your budget and whatever is on sale. It is a bit of a hassle to get the SATA cable so you can install a 2.5 SATA HDD or SSD for additional storage. You may not need it right away but it is nice to know the upgrade is available. For the price hardware upgrade options the Aspire 5 would be a great purchase. Someone might point you to the Swift series as a more viable option.

cqbki8,AcerOfficial,You might have the same series but depending on the country of origin date of manufacturing and actual model number I doubt you'll ever find a YouTube video for the exact same laptop. The 2.5 drive IS the second drive. You would install a m.2 SSD as the boot primary and use the 2.5 SATA for additional data. The latest Nitro laptops have 2 m.2 PCIe ports. My view is that Optane boost while great to improve platter drive performance is a waste of a PCIe port unless you don't have the budget to upgrade. rant Why use a small Optane SSD to cache a copy of Windows when you can run your entire installation from the m.2 SSD and get even better performance? /rant At least you ended up with the good Optane SSD. The performance of that 32GB is far superior to the 16GB so don't trash it. I have an ACER Aspire 5 A515-52-526C i5-8265U quad core . It had a 256GB SATA m.2 in the PCIe port.

Once they actually work on the computers received before yours they will then run their idea of diagnostics to discover the problem you have already told them in detail. So maybe it will take a month or 6 weeks. They might have a new guy who does it in a few days because he doesn't know he isn't supposed to show any competence. They might take a shortcut and not even bother sending back the same laptop. They could just pull a previously repaired one off the shelf send it to you.

One of the versions of Quick Launch Acer Quick Access is supposed to have additional options for Dust Defender i.e. disable at startup . Acer can't seem to figure out what to do with Dust Defender so their official support suggestions seem to vary or not exist at all for specific Acer models and versions of originally installed software. You might have to search for the registry entries specific to Dust Defender. From what I've seen by looking at the keys its a simple boolean 0 or 1 entry to enable or disable. I'm not posting anything here because if you gimp your system I don't want you screaming at me. blah blah blah usual warnings about editing your registry should go here.

cm0zhh,AcerOfficial,I have the same model and it experiences the same when its not directly connected to power. I've heard that since it has a dedicated gpu it requires more power or something to that effect.

My 2060 stops at 810mhz memoryspeed instead of 7000 if i dont have it plugged in. In terms of cooling they might have just slapped on some basic TIM on the cpu and gpu dies so putting on some noctua or kryonaut would probably give you a bit more temp to work with. ultimately you should download and run the sensors in HWiNFO64 and see what your temperatures and cpgpu speeds are at when stressing them. im assuming at least the cpu has to be at 90 and slowing down critically. hope you get it sorted but if not let acer know that shit isnt gonna fly and fire it back their way. i did that with the i7 9750H laptop i had gotten from lenovo since it was essentially opening up a portal to hell just by playing games.,0.102,0.856,0.042,-0.9231,-1

I'm never surprised when the RAM that ships works in the machine isn't what the manufacturer lists in the specs. I noticed your picture is 1.5v DDR3-1333 PC3-10600. I had to look up the part number since you didn't show the detail sticker. Crucial shows low voltage 1.35v DDR3L-1600 PC3-12800 for upgrade compatibility.

ckujib,AcerOfficial,Although you could have provided more details about your router 802.11a/g/n/ac mfg model firmware version WiFi frequency 2.4GHz or 5GHz channels in use adapter driver version etc. I'll make a few suggestions. If your friend had played games there previously without any problems and it was only your machine disconnecting the troubleshooting list is a little shorter. I almost lost my mind one year when every day around 5 30pm my 2.4GHz WiFi would die. The short version of the story is that I happened to look out the window and saw my neighbor pull up just before the WiFi died. His freaking garage door opener was flooding the same frequency. Many cordless phones and some mice use the 2.4GHz frequency range too. Start with the simple stuff the router might have a bug in the firmware specific to your environment check to see if there is an update available. Install an app on your phone to scan for local WiFi access points. I like the free Farproc WiFi Analyzer because it shows the channels in use around you. You might have to change the channel you are using to the least used channel being broadcast around you. If your WiFi access point or all-in-one router has multi-frequency options try switching from G to N. That is after you run the scan to see what is being broadcast around you. If you have the Intel WiFi adapter go to the Intel site to check for an update instead of the older driver on the Acer website.,0.045,0.897,0.058,0.3214,1

cj3lf3,AcerOfficial,I've seen a lot of similar complaints about the Helios draining the battery while plugged in.

Acer does offer a 330w adapter in their store so you could probably find a less expensive OEM adapter on Amazon or Ebay.

cg4kca,AcerOfficial,The RTX performs better based on userbenchmark.com but I believe the 2060 you select there for comparison is probably the desktop card which probably runs faster than the laptop 2060 as they are usually a bit slower due to various constrictions in power and dimension etc... However I think the 1660 ti even if somewhat slower would probably be more useful for most laptop users since afaik its also more power efficient than the 2060 which is a big plus for gaming on the train or unplugged in general.

Triton 500 is amazing if you can tolerate the gaming logo which cannot be turned off and some blue tinted keys. Otherwise I'd say that it is best in the rtx 2060 bunch below razerblade 15 ofc... But lower price makes up for it . Also the laptop is really... like really difficult to upgrade as the motherboard is flipped upside down so if you get rtx 2060 model and 512gb of ssd is not enough for you then this might be a deal breaker. Wasn't for me as I'm comfortable with using external hdds and don't really store much stuff on my laptop anyways.,0.068,0.825,0.106,0.8551,1

c8b1nd,AcerOfficial,I returned an X-27 because the screen blacked out after switching to either of my Sony 4k blu ray players on the third movie I tried to watch via the HDMI port. The first two movies I watched I was able to switch from the Display Port input to the HDMI input with no issues. I did try multiple cables including a brand new higher bandwidth 8K cable to no avail. The picture would come back after switching back to Display Port. I now have the XB273K and the black screen has happened once. Unplugging/replugging brought back the picture this time. Seems to be an Acer issue with these panels since no other monitor I have or ever had has this issue. I also get frequent picture dropouts when quitting games to desktop etc. These issues are troubling not to mention irritating at this 1000.00 price point. I may return this monitor also because I am afraid it is going to die on me and I will have to go through a month long rma process or that it will die the day after the warranty ends. Too bad they didn't implement an end-user firmware update protocol. The Acer display widget doesn't work with this monitor either.,0.102,0.886,0.012,-0.9579,-1

c4zgkl,AcerOfficial,Definitely get in touch with service and ask them about it. There are probably two ways this happened - maybe service just made a mistake by replacing faulty SSD with wrong type. It should not happen but they are also just people so sometimes this is the case. If you contact them without any delay after the repair they should correct this mistake even if your device is out of warranty. There might also be another explanation - in lot of laptop they use same type of SSDs but from different manufacturers and with a slightly different specifications. Perhaps originally there was faster SSD in your laptop but service had only same type but slower ones on stock so they used them. Then it might be ok. There is also a third possibility there is problem with this new SSD. But only service can get you an answer and eventually a solution. Regarding warranty - in my country warranty is extended for the time laptop is in service center maybe it is the same at your country.

For me I have to hold the Power Button for 3 seconds and then I can see Windows initiating the proper shutdown sequence. Maybe count to 4 and release and see if it does anything for you? I believe they implemented this because of the proximity of the button to the rest of the keys. Stupid idea as I don't want to accidentally do a hard shutdown from holding the power button too long usually 5 seconds on every single other computer .
