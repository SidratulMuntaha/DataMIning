"6","fitxh3","Hi are you open to refurbished or used laptops "
"7","fi2yzl","If you buy immediately i e within the next 38 hours you can get this HP Pavilion 15z for 529 It comes with a Ryzen 5 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage HP keyboards are decent but do be aware they can be rather clicky he screen also meets your requirements with as the name suggests 15 of 1080p splendour While the Pavilion is a little mediocre at this price I cannot recommend it enough If you don t quite make the sale I would recommend the Dell Inspiron 14 5000 It s 629 which is a little over your budget but is quite good value with a 10th gen Core i5 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage he only thing to note is that Dell s quality control can apparently be a little shoddy so you may get a faulty unit If that happens just contact them and they will replace it free of charge "
"8","fi2yzl","Hey Best specs for the money can be translated into the most powerful specs this means a gaming laptop and I don t think you ll need that I d recommend this one Lenovo hinkpad E595 it s 620 at Newegg and you re getting a quad core Ryzen processor Vega 10 integrated graphics Full HD LED IPS display SSD and room for an HDD 2 memory slots over 8H battery life a very good peripheral port selection 1 X USB C 3 1 2 X USB 3 1 1 X USB 2 0 MicroSD card reader 1 X LAN and a Chiclet keyboard Spill resistant But if your budget is strict these could be alternatives search engine can see and change the search parameters using the Refine results button in the upper left part of the search results page You can also click on the laptops for more information Hope I helped "

"11","fi2yzl","I would recommend this Acer Aspire 5 because of the following It offers great value for money since it comes with 8 GB RAM and 256GB SSD and both are somewhat standards in 600 range so finding them on 500 range is somewhat a catch Slim sleek high quality case and the aluminum lid gives the Aspire a premium look You can actually rotate the lid back a little beyond 180 degrees meaning you can lay the laptop completely flat with the lid open It is lightweight for its size at 3 97 lbs Comes with backlit keyboard you also get a dedicated numeric keypad with a somewhat narrow design Battery life advertised Up to 7 5 hours Battery Life Comes with a range of ports including HDMI USB 3 1 USB 2 0 You can upgrade SSD and RAM up to 20GB according to this is a more detailed review of the Acer Aspire 5 sure to check out his Laptop Buying Guide post for best laptops "
"12","fhh9ug","Yes it will shred CS GO even on max What the CPU number means i7 Intel s second fastest line of consumer CPUs after the i9 and before the i5 9 he 9th generation of i7s also known as Coffee Lake 750 Fastest chip in this line depending on the final letter Intel tend to go up to 750 H Fastest laptop chip but can be power hungry "
"13","fhh9ug","I d recommend staying away from dell G3 as it has terrible heating issues I d rather recommend the Lenovo Y540 or the Asus Zephyrus G hey are far better value than the G3"
"14","fhh9ug","1 Mobile Ryzen 4000 is too close not to wait 9750H runs hot on cooling much better than the G3 s "
"15","fhh9ug","he Gpu is not on par with the cpu and the 512 ssd is bare minimum so more storage would be good"
"16","fhh9ug","Have you looked at the Acer Helios 300 same specs and better cooling than the Dell I am using one and the specs are good for playing latest games on high and it comes with factory undervolting Fans get noisy if they ramp up but I use a headset so no problem "
"17","fhh9ug","Hey Short answer yes Long answer Dell Gaming G3 15 3590 is a decent gaming laptop It s the budget friendly version of the G5 G7 so it doesn t have the best build quality I7 9750H is a six core processor that combined with GX 1660 I Max Q will allow you to play most AAA games in high settings his laptop will handle whatever you will throw at it with no problems but I do recommend undervolting What is your budget Maybe we can find something better "
"18","fhh9ug","Yeah it should work our week unless you plan on running super intense games like Red dead 2 and Ultra settings or something"
"19","fhh9ug","o search for laptop go to noteb com also i7 9750h very good as well as 1660 ti"
"20","fhh9ug","Yeah that would be a great option but how much are you paying for it "
"21","fhh9ug","People have been saying that the Dell G3 I m going to get is prone to overheating Is there a laptop that has similar specs i7 processor gtx 1660 gtx 1070 16gb ram that has better thermal control and doesn t overheat If I m buying a laptop I don t want it to be hot to the touch but I also don t want it to run loud fans when I m doing college work in class I don t mind if the fans are on during gaming but surely they can t be that loud right "
"22","fhh9ug","rust me i7 9750H is one of the most powerful laptop CPUs saying from experience With 1660i it will run CSGO Overwatch like butter on Max Graphics So basicallyi7 9750H i7 Stronger than i5 i3 and weaker than i9 More than enough for you 9 9th Generation Latest for laptops 750 Really really fast chip H laptop model Also 6 cores so enough for heavier games GX 1660iNot the most powerful laptop GPU but more than enough for your needs here are better options but they tend to run loud and hot Overall these are good specs but I don t really trust Dell I have heard a lot of complains about them and their Alienware series have a lot of defective products Don t know much about G series though Hope this helps Good luck man"
"23","fhu8dv","You don t need as much as you think I run a base model Surface Pro 6 i5 8gbs and Im in Electrical and Computer engineering My machine works amazing for me despite all of the processor and computer organization softwares we model and work on in school If you want a good battery stay away from 4K screens Unless it s in the Surface lineup stay away from 2in1 s conventional clamshells have a higher build quality and unless it s an iPad or a Surface product it s hard to use a 2in1 for notes and whatnot laptop as a tablet can be cumbersome Sometimes the Surface Book 2 has great deals especially on Newegg Some models not all have a GX 1060 plus the screen is detachable for notes and hw and a great battery "
"24","fhu8dv","Seeing as you ll be doing a lot of CAD perhaps a hinkPad P1 would be right for you I would recommend the second model to your left with the Quadro graphics just because you say you ll be doing some light gaming and a discrete card is good for that It costs 1669 for a 9th gen Core i7 a Quadro 1000 16GB of RAM and 256GB of story It isn t exactly sleek but it has the power to do what you need and do it well "
"25","fhu8dv","he MSI GS65 Stealth 006 is a great laptop to get intense gaming discreetly as it has a clean and professional look It has a firm chassis which gives it a premium and robust feel to it and it is very lightweight which makes it very easy to take around When gaming the fans get a bit loud but that is expected for small chassis laptops as the fans have to work a lot to keep it cool Upgrading is a pain to do as the motherboard is upside down but with time you can do it Heat wise adobe premiere and heavy editing software won t cause it to throttle but going all out on AAA games might Its battery life is around 6 hours for general use15 6 144Hz Ultra hin and Light Gaming Laptop Intel Core i7 8750H NVIDIA RX 2060 16GB DDR4 512GB Nvme SSD Win10"
"26","fhu8dv","How about this HP seems like a good option for what you are looking for "
"27","fhu8dv","Hi I think that there are 2 in 1s that are strong enough for you he Lenovo Yoga C940 with a 6 core i7 processor and GX 1650 graphics comes to mind which should be powerful enough for those games and CAD software You can use Lenovo s stylus to draw notes on the screen Build quality is pretty good it is a flagship 2 in 1 "

"141","fd0wcn","Have a look at the Lenovo hinkPad E590 it will give you a similar feel to the one you have now It can multitask well and should play well with linux 15 6 FHD 1920x1080 IPS Anti Glare Display Intel Core i5 8265U Processor 16GB RAM 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD 1B Hard Drive"
"142","fd0wcn","New thinkpad"
"143","fd0wcn","Hi I think that a modern hinkPad is definitely the way to go he Lenovo hinkPad E595 is very affordable and has what is necessary for your use case It has a Ryzen 5 processor 8 GB RAM a 256 GB SSD and a 1080p 15 6 IPS display which is a grea combination for general use on Linux he keyboard should be similar to your X220 hinkPads still have great keyboards "
"144","fd0wcn","I would recommend this Acer Swift 3 because of the following it weighs 3 75lbs which is light like you want he casing made of brushed aluminum and looks very premium he keyboard is a chiclet keyboard typing on it feels spongy but you get used to it quickly Drag and drop sometimes doesn t work as intended but that is easily fixed with software Screen is glossy Full HD IPS with very good viewing angles the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20 if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive he main and maybe only con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get it is not usable in direct sunlight and the coverage of colors is average 39 RGB and 61 sRGB Has very good heat management and it doesn t throttle Speakers provide very clear sounds and the maximum volume is pretty loud Battery life is very good at around 9 11 hours of usage on light to medium usage Make sure to check out his Laptop Buying Guide post for best laptops "

"147","fcxf9r","I would recommend this Acer Spin 5 since it matches most of your requirements as it has a full HD screen comes with 8th gen i7 quad core CPU comes with USB 2 0 2 USB 3 0 3 1 Gen1 1 HDMI Card Reader SD and 1x USB 3 1 Gen 1 ype C long battery life Up to 10 hours and the case is made predominantly of aluminium and supports an input pen that can be used for the touchscreen such as the Acer Stylus Pen and it s within your budget And if you prefer better sRGB coverage for photo and video editing and can push your budget a little higher then I would recommend this Lenovo Yoga 730 because it comes with everything you need 8th generation i7 quad core CPU 16GB of ram good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading 15 6 inch 4K UHD IPS touch screen high build quality backlit keyboard supports pen and thunderbolt port I thought I would give you a little more in depth review so here it goes It s equipped with Intel Core i7 8550U which is commonly used in gaming laptops most convertibles use low powered dual core processors he processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work s intensive tasks and gaming Full HD IPS 15 6 4K ouchscreen which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies videos With color range of 90 sRGB and 59 Adobe RGB it s one of the best for this price and it s suitable for photo and video editing Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it s not the best choice for outside usage NVIDIA GeForce GX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops Heat management isn t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures but it doesn t reach the point of hurting the internal components Good upgrades available can change the SSD It s relatively easily upgradable which isn t the case for most convertibles It s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3 0 ports and a hunderbolt 3 Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non gaming usage Minimal bloat ware speakers have excellent quality but not so loud Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards rackpad aren t much different with windows precision driver It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate he body is sturdy and feels premium as it s all aluminum Make sure to check out his Laptop Buying Guide post for best laptops "

"161","fcr0c9","I think something like the Acer Helios 300 would be what you re looking for A little chonkier which means your parts will stay cooler overall and you ll have more space to tinker if necessary good build quality and keyboard and excellent performance "
"162","fcr0c9","Eluktronics max 15 without a doubt Get it with MasterGel thermal paste upgrade from their website It has excellent keyboard acceptable display 95 sRGB 350nits 144hz and incredible performance because CPU power limits are unlocked to 100w making this outperform most other laptops locked to 45 55w he GPU is elukboosted to 115w again making it outperform other laptops locked to 80 90w"
"163","fcr0c9","Check out the Lenovo hinkPad P53s or one of its variants to get the reliability that you want Intel i7 8565U 4 Core 24GB RAM 1B PCIe SSD Quadro P520 15 6 Full HD 1920x1080 Fingerprint WiFi Bluetooth Webcam 2xUSB 3 1 Win 10 Pro with USB3 0 Hub x200B hinkpads are known for their reliable build quality and longevity It has a professional look which is ideal for an office setting and with 24 GB of RAM and a quad core CPU it will be able to multitask well having lots of tabs open while streaming and working on documents without lagging It has a bright screen and is able to edit smoothly and game fairly well not AAA on max settings good though "

"651","fa3e9c","Where did you get this charger I m interested in buying one that powerful "
"652","fa3e9c","My impression is that the funny business going on with Dell is more like few particular power levels accepted and unreliable PD negotiation With XPS 15 for instance it is known that in most cases 60W 20V 3A get accepted but some with a few such chargers the negotiation fails while 45W 20V 2 25A gets accepted only from Dell and one 3rd party while most others fail Recent models tend to take 65W but I don t recall anything higher reported accepted except for the Dell original 130W chargers that are above standard 100W max I ve noticed a PD controller being updated during one firmware update Indeed it would be nice if Dell took care of this now that 100W PD chargers and powerbanks are becoming more widely available With Dell round plug chargers that provide one way power level identification the laptops can accept different power levels available 45W 60W 90W 130W ry contacting the charger manufacturer if they can debug this "
"653","fa3e9c","From my limited research into docks for my xps 15 recently it seems like the USBC 130W dock can do 130W over USB for Dell laptops others would be at 90W So it s probably a Dell thing "

"655","f9p1wy","90 sure it s static electricity from your socks or something Been near any wool lately Did you wear rubber soled shoes maybe "
"656","f9p1wy","As stated above it could be a couple of different things either static electricity or a bad outlet If you have a bad outlet or even a bad surge protector then it s possible that the AC adapter to your laptop isn t grounding earth properly Laptops actually run on DC current that is converted from house AC current fun fact hat brick box in the middle of your power cord is actually an electrical transformer that is where the magic happens to transform AC to DC Because the laptop actually runs on DC there s no reverse current to dissipate voltage buildup kinda like overflowing a cup with water the voltage has no where to go his voltage buildup is typically dissipated to ground earth from the transformer and is a natural normal thing in electronics However if you don t have a good ground then your body becomes the ground when you touch your laptop which releases the built up voltage that you experience as a shock oo much voltage buildup is really really hard on your laptop and you should immediately check for a bad ground On the other side it is possible it s just static electricity Unsure of where you are located but if you re in the US there s a large snow storm for much of the country yesterday Hot temperatures with low humidity like a heater running plus socks cause it s friggin COLD outside can encourage and emphasize static buildup just like the AC adapter You walk around generate a voltage buildup touch the laptop which is grounded and zap voltage dissipated Quick test plug your laptop into a wall outlet with a new surge protector in a room with tile wood floor no carpet and bare feet urn it on see if it zaps you If it does it s a bad ground in your house and you need an electrician to check it out If it doesn t it s probably static electricity and not a big deal maybe consider a grounding mat from Amazon or just be more aware of how static electricity is formed so you can avoid it angent voltage buildup in a laptop is typically caused from the cooling fans running turning magnet in an electrical field generates an electrical current It s very normal and is typically low enough to dissipate into the chassis and grounded out A major shock and or a frequent shock is probably not the fans though "
"657","f9p1wy","Might be something wrong with your outlets and not the laptop "

"729","f5ionq","Using an ultrabook for development was a bit of a concern when they first came out here we are almost 10 years later and they have come a long way Generally I find that desktops will give best perf using say 85W or whatever CPU s then a few years later the 45w CPU s typically found in 15 laptops match that perf then a few years later then 15w CPU s found in ultrabooks catch up and I imagine the 5 7w parts a few years after that Of course the advancements in storage and RAM help too More concretely I briefly tried the new XPS 13 2 in 1 as well as a lenovo C940 and now I m on a Surface Pro 7 hey ve all been using the same 10th gen i7 cpu and similar specced ram I can run my webdev stuff just fine several VS code windows a nodejs server running a webpack create react app frontend db server redis etc etc It all performs just fine and each machine this was the case he perf is ever so slightly faster than my 2016 MBP which in turn is ever so slightly faster than my 2014 desktop Just make sure you get 16GB of ram I find that my dev setup takes around 9 GB of RAM which does mean a lot of paging and random slowdowns when running on an 8 GB machine such as my SP6 part of the reason I wanted to upgrade I ended up going w the SP 7 because I found out my work will be upgrading my MBP I like the idea of the small ish tablet form factor that I can still do dev on as a companion to the larger 16 device I liked the xps as well the screen was gorgeous though the thermals were not amazing and for me I didn t like the feel of the keyboard it was too much like my MBP Also the layout w dedicated page up and down buttons over the left and right arrow keys and having to use a FN key for home insert was the nail in the coffin most devices I ve been using over the past 10 years use FN arrow keys for pg up down and home insert and I kept accidentally hitting the page up down buttons when trying to use the left and right arrow keys hese things could likely be gotten used to though and as long as you know what you re getting yourself into with that it s a fine machine perf wise "

"860","etv3kp","470 20HDS08J00 user here no thunderbolt firmware mine is currently on version 04 00 on lvfs furthermore gnome firmware states that the thunderbolt controller is not supported on lvfs depsite the UEFI and other system firmwares being supported It appears Lenovo only cares about Windows users for the 470 seems like 480 as well since the update is only available as a exe on lenovo s support page it might be possible to extract the firmware from the exe file I have not investigated further than this Option B is to boot to windows to update the firmware using the exe shame edit booted windows 10 oGo USB created with RUFUS darn slow and installed the update it looks like the firmware file might be extractable from the exe by running it with wine and selecting extract only anyways I am now at version 20 00"
"861","etv3kp","I got another update just pushed to me yesterday involving the thunderbolt driver controller I ve been checking every day and apparently this update was released by mid February If I m just now getting this fix Lenovo can plan to replace my X390 "

"900","fhp4nr","o eBay s system your order got delivered and has been fulfilled since tracking shows the package has been delivered I ve seen this before but never experienced it first hand I would let eBay know about this Your period for returns refunds starts with day of delivery in this case day of delivery of the letter So let eBay know that you have in fact not received the goods yet I do not think this is a stunt or that the seller won t send you the screen in a reasonable amount of time I believe this is their way of trying to trick eBay s systems into believing that they are very fast and reliable on fulfilling orders to maybe get some higher ranking on their platform "

"948","fgbmz4","Yes you can expect more problems in the future Water damage is a slow killer sometimes it kills machines instantly but most times it can take weeks months for problems to appear It is also very difficult to say what might fail and when as every case is different Yours might be one of the worse ones whereas spilled water more or less is forced in a best of a bad situation route in an attempt to save many of the more important components your case could be worse because condensation pretty much can form wherever there s any air so pretty much everywhere in the machine On the upside the minerals found in tap or bottled water are not present in condensation so this removes one potentially damaging factor however connectors and components inside will still oxidize over time he fact that the machine didnt turn on initially is a very solid indication that the water got in places that are important for the machines function Also i dont think the battery is your biggest problem those are reasonably easy and cheaply replaced compared to a motherboard for example It is of also possible that you were very lucky and no permanent damage was done as long as you expect the worst backup your important data on regular intervals then you ll avoid big problems with lost work and disappointment if the machine does give up the ghost eventually "

"967","ffnc6q","here s an ongoing USB C charging mod but the P series is not covered at the moment I don t think it s likely it ll ever get support for it due to the presumably higher power draw but no harm keeping tabs on it After reading the well written purchase page linked via Reddit it s extremely unlikely that the 170W power draw will ever be supported Even the newer P series with built in USB C and PD support will charge slower via it he other spec you should be more concerned is the storage Unless the 256 GB SSD is a particularly bad unit otherwise it s likely that its all round performance will beat the 500 GB HDD his has heavy implications from start up speeds to disk intensive activities e g video editing "
